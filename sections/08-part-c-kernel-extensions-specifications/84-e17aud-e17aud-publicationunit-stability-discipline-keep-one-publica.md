## E.17.AUD - PublicationUnit Stability Discipline - keep one publication unit stable enough to read honestly

**Placement.** First publication-unit stability pattern for publication units whose active problem must be handled by one existing governing FPF pattern or by one project-side record or publication whose governing FPF pattern is named: local lexical-head repair, whole-unit primary-described-entity stabilization, bounded comparison, or a neighboring non-publication-unit pattern.

**Builds on.** `C.2.2a`, `A.16.0`, `A.7`, `E.10`, `F.18`, `E.14`, `E.19`.

**Coordinates with.** `E.17.AUD.LHR`, `E.17.AUD.OOTD`, `E.17.ID.CR`, `E.17.EFP`, `A.6.3`, `A.6.3.CR`, `A.6.3.RT`, `A.10`, `A.15`, `A.15.4`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`.

**Plain-name.** Keep one publication unit stable enough to read honestly.

**One-line summary.** `PublicationUnit Stability Discipline` is the first stability discipline for notes, memos, sheets, tables, screens, and short sections whose primary-described-entity reading, carried publication move, or outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim has become unstable while the unit still looks unchanged. It helps the reader decide whether the honest next repair is local lexical-head repair, whole-unit primary-described-entity stabilization, bounded comparison over already stable source publications, or leaving the publication-unit stability family for a neighboring non-publication-unit pattern.

**Governed publication unit in plain terms.** The governed unit is the publication unit itself: one note, memo, sheet, table, screen, or short section that people are expected to read as one readable unit. When the unit carries or exposes a claim-bearing episteme or episteme-lane `U.View`, the primary described entity is the already-governed described entity of that carried item. When no claim-bearing episteme or episteme-lane view is live, do not invent a `DescribedEntityRef`; name the exact non-claim-bearing kind, or use plain topic or subject only in non-normative explanatory prose. Keep those relations separate: this pattern governs the unit as a readable unit, while the whole-unit repair pattern checks whether that unit still keeps one stable primary described entity or exact subject by value.

**Minimal lens in plain terms.** Use a four-part reading: one governed unit, one primary described entity, one carried publication move over that described entity, and one outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim. That outside boundary usually needs one light boundary type too: neighboring pattern application, downstream claim or effect, or ongoing engineering-process continuation. If any of those reading relations changes quietly, the unit is no longer honest enough to read as one unchanged publication unit.

**Local working vocabulary.**
- `governed unit` = the note, memo, sheet, table, screen, or short section being kept honest as one unit;
- `primary described entity` = the exact described entity of the claim-bearing episteme or episteme-lane view that the unit carries or exposes when such an item is live; otherwise use exact non-claim-bearing kind, topic, or subject without creating a `DescribedEntityRef`;
- `carried publication move` = the publication-side claim, reading, comparison, or explanation move that the unit performs over that primary described entity;
- `outside work boundary` = downstream `U.Work`, `U.WorkPlanning`, decision, gate, or reliance claim that still remains outside the unit;
- `downstream claim or effect` = an approval, assignment, go or no-go, gate, work, or reliance claim or effect that readers infer from the unit but that belongs outside this pattern unless explicitly handled by its governing pattern or by the exact project-side FPF kind and reference that governs that claim or effect.
**A.6.P unpacking of overloaded local words.** This pattern does not use `route`, `branch`, `head`, or `unit` as hidden ontology. Use these roles instead:
- `local lexical head` = the head word or phrase inside one load-bearing sentence or heading, such as `review`, `reading`, `interpretation`, `note`, or `text`; it is not an FPF pattern head, not a package-family head, and not a language-state alternative;
- `publication-unit repair disposition` = the current repair disposition: local lexical-head repair, whole-unit primary-described-entity stabilization, bounded comparison, explanation classification, representation change, controlled coarsening, changed described entity, or downstream decision, gate, work, or reliance claim;
- `governing FPF pattern or exact project-side FPF kind and reference` = the named FPF pattern, or a project-side evidence record, gate record, decision record, work plan, work occurrence, method, action invitation, relation record, or `U.EpistemePublication` whose governing FPF pattern is named;
- `publication-unit stability family` = the relation among `E.17.AUD`, `E.17.AUD.LHR`, `E.17.AUD.OOTD`, and neighboring comparison and explanation patterns; it is not a runtime path and not a transduction sequence;
- `presentation-form label` = `note`, `memo`, `sheet`, `screen`, and similar form words; these are only form clues until the governed publication unit and primary described entity are restored.

When any of those roles is load-bearing, record the selected role in the working card rather than polishing the sentence with another generic word.

**Use this when.** Use this pattern when one note, memo, sheet, screen, table, or short section is no longer trustworthy as one stable reading unit. Use it when people keep arguing about a paragraph, but the real question is simpler: repair one local lexical head, stabilize the whole unit, treat the unit as bounded comparison, or stop using this pattern because another FPF pattern or project publication governs the live claim.

**First-minute working moment.** A memo starts by naming one described entity, then quietly makes a different publication move over it, or quietly becomes about a different described entity. One reviewer wants to repair one vague local lexical head. Another wants to rewrite the whole memo. A third person thinks the unit is already a bounded comparison or a downstream decision or reliance publication. You need one honest stabilization decision before the unit gets patched in three incompatible ways.

**What goes wrong if you miss this.** Teams keep fixing sentences without agreeing on the governed unit. Local lexical-head repair gets asked to carry whole-unit stabilization. Whole-unit stabilization gets asked to carry bounded comparison. Comparison gets mistaken for approval or rollout. A more polished or official-looking format gets mistaken for downstream claim or effect. The text stays readable enough to circulate, but no longer honest enough to trust.

**What this buys you in practice.** It gives one quick publication-unit stabilization decision before the draft widens or needs a neighboring governing pattern or downstream publication. Teams can decide earlier whether to stay local, stabilize the whole publication unit, apply bounded comparison, or leave the publication-unit stability family entirely for a more honest neighboring pattern or downstream publication.

**Cheap stop.** If the four-part reading names one governed unit, one primary described entity, one carried publication move, and one outside boundary clearly enough for the current reader, stop with that stabilization decision. Do not build a dossier or open the wider support sections unless the unit still attracts comparison, explanation, evidence, gate, decision, work, or reliance overread.

**Not this pattern when.** This is not the right pattern when:
- one overloaded local lexical head is still the only real defect and `Local Head Restoration` is enough;
- the publication unit is already stable and the active problem situation is one bounded comparison over already pinned source publications;
- the main problem situation is explanation classification over an existing face, view, carrier, or publication discipline, or another neighboring semio pattern rather than publication-unit stability;
- the text is already being used to approve, direct, assign, or adjudicate work and should use the more honest downstream decision, gate, work, or reliance publication.

**Primary working reader.** The first working reader is an author or reviewer who needs to stop one memo, note, sheet, table, screen, or short section from quietly changing its primary described entity, carried publication move, or downstream claim or effect. Architects, managers, and program leads are important secondary readers when they need the same governing-pattern and project-side-reference boundary signal, but they are not the first-minute reader for this opening recognition surface.

**Quick kind stack.** `PublicationUnit Stability Discipline` keeps the current publication-unit problem from being repaired at the wrong level. `E.17.AUD.LHR` governs the local lexical-head repair case: one word or phrase inside the unit is carrying too much semantic load while the unit otherwise stays stable. `E.17.AUD.OOTD` governs the whole-unit stabilization case: the same publication unit no longer keeps one primary described entity, one carried publication move, and one outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim visible. `E.17.ID.CR` governs the bounded-comparison case once the publication unit is stable and the primary move is comparison over available source publications. Other explanation, representation, bridge, gate, approval, work, or reliance problem situations belong to their own governing FPF patterns, or to project-side records and publications whose governing FPF pattern is named. This pattern names that working distinction; it does not create a path, call chain, fixed process, or runtime control path.

**Quick recognition matrix.**

| Situation | What is really happening | Honest next reading |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An episteme-publication-heavy note keeps using vague lexical heads such as `review`, `reading`, or `interpretation` | the whole unit is mostly stable, but one overloaded local lexical head is doing too much semantic work | stay local with `Local Head Restoration` |
| An architecture or status memo starts about one bounded question, then quietly starts sounding like rollout, approval, go or no-go, or assignment publication | the publication unit now carries a quiet shift in primary described entity or carried publication move | apply `PublicationUnit Primary Described-Entity Discipline` |
| A comparison sheet already keeps one stable primary described entity and one clear boundary, but reviewers keep treating it as if it needed whole-unit rescue | the unit is stable enough; the active problem situation is bounded contrast over already available source publications | apply `ComparativeReading` |
| An onboarding explainer, dashboard card, or review note starts to act as if cleaner prose alone licensed an unsupported policy claim, assurance claim, work claim, or reliance claim | the problem situation has left publication-unit stability and entered a neighboring explanation problem or downstream claim or effect | apply the neighboring governing pattern instead of keeping the case inside publication-unit stability |

**Recognition-surface note.** The opening card above is the quick recognition surface. The sections below carry the heavier assurance surface: publication-unit boundary decisions, A.6.P unpacking, governing-pattern and project-side-reference boundary decisions, worked slices, and SoTA and domain grounding.

### E.17.AUD:1 - Problem frame

**Anti-single-sequence note.** The publication-unit checks, recognition matrix, and worked slices below are working aids for one publication unit under review. They are not a fixed engineering process and not a promise that every admissible case moves through one mandatory sequence.

This pattern is for real publication units used in review, design, architecture, coordination, onboarding, and similar reading situations. It is for the moment when one publication unit still sounds like one unchanged note even after its described entity, carried publication move, or downstream claim or effect has already changed.

The recurring defect family is simple:
- one publication unit begins as if it were about one described entity or claim target;
- the unit then quietly changes its primary described entity, carried publication move, or outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim;
- the surrounding team starts repairing different defect families at once because nobody first named the active publication-unit problem situation.

Typical moments include:
- an episteme-publication-heavy note where one broad local lexical head starts carrying more load than the sentence restored;
- an architecture or status memo that starts about one bounded described entity or question and ends by sounding like rollout or approval work;
- a comparison sheet that is already stable enough locally, but is still being overworked as if it needed full publication-unit stabilization;
- an onboarding aid, dashboard card, or review note that quietly shifts into explanation, policy, or decision language while still sounding like one unchanged unit.

### E.17.AUD:2 - Problem

Without a named publication-unit stability discipline:
1. teams repair local wording when the real defect is whole-unit reading instability;
2. teams open whole-unit stabilization when the real defect is still one overloaded local lexical head;
3. teams keep thickening a publication-unit repair when the active problem situation is already bounded comparison;
4. teams mistake note, sheet, table, or screen language for different governed unit kinds when the real governed unit is still one publication unit in different presentation forms;
5. teams over-attribute engineering-process, approval, or rollout claim or effect to a text that never honestly became that kind of unit.

### E.17.AUD:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| **Recognisability vs precision** | Cold readers need a quick recognition surface, but the unit still needs explicit primary-described-entity, carried-publication-move, and outside-work discipline. |
| **Local repair vs whole-unit stabilization** | It is cheaper to fix one overloaded local lexical head, but sometimes the whole publication unit already carries a quiet shift in primary described entity, carried publication move, or outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim. |
| **Stability vs governing-pattern boundary honesty** | Teams want to keep one unit usable, but they also need to admit when the case now belongs to comparison, explanation, or downstream claim or effect. |
| **Form variety vs governed-unit fidelity** | Note, memo, sheet, table, and screen are convenient ordinary labels, but they must not silently replace the governed publication unit. |
| **Readability vs downstream claim or effect laundering** | Clearer or more polished prose helps readers, but it does not by itself mint approval, policy, gate, work, or reliance claim or effect. |

### E.17.AUD:4 - Solution

> `PublicationUnit Stability Discipline` is the first stabilization decision for one publication unit whose reading is unstable.
>
> It names the current repair disposition: what the unit is mainly about, what move it is carrying, and which governing FPF pattern or exact project-side FPF kind and reference governs the live case. It does not certify the unit or make a paperwork dossier.

#### E.17.AUD:4.1 - Minimum admissible reading

A locally admissible reading keeps four entries visible enough to inspect by value:
- one governed unit;
- one primary described entity;
- one carried publication move over that described entity;
- one outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim, with one light boundary type when that distinction matters: neighboring pattern application, downstream claim or effect, or ongoing engineering-process continuation.

If the publication unit changes any of those four without saying so, its reading has already shifted even when the sentences still look polished.

#### E.17.AUD:4.2 - Publication-unit stability vs whole-unit requirement
**Light ordinary output.** The ordinary output is one repair disposition, not a dossier:
- `stable for current use`: the four-part reading is explicit enough and no neighboring bridge, prompt, ontology, action, gate, adjudication, authority, or downstream claim is live;
- `local lexical-head repair`: one overloaded local head should apply `E.17.AUD.LHR`;
- `whole-unit stabilization`: the unit should apply `E.17.AUD.OOTD`;
- `bounded comparison`: the stable unit should apply `E.17.ID.CR`;
- `leave publication-unit stability`: the live claim is work, work planning, decision, gate, evidence, explanation, reliance, carrier or front-end work, or another object governed by its exact neighboring FPF pattern or exact project-side FPF kind and reference.


`PublicationUnit Stability Discipline` is the first stabilization decision for one publication unit whose reading is unstable.
Its job is to name the current repair disposition and then handle the case under the governing FPF pattern or exact project-side FPF kind and reference that already governs that disposition: `E.17.AUD.LHR` for local lexical-head repair, `E.17.AUD.OOTD` for whole-unit stabilization, `E.17.ID.CR` for bounded comparison, or another neighboring pattern when the live claim has left publication-unit stability.

It does **not** re-govern the narrower whole-unit admissibility check that already belongs to `PublicationUnit Primary Described-Entity Discipline` once the active question becomes: can this one unit still keep one stable primary described entity, one carried publication move, and one outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim by value?

#### E.17.AUD:4.3 - Inherited dynamic frame

This pattern governs the publication-unit stability boundary over the inherited lineage and move frame already carried by `C.2.2a` or `A.16.0`. It is about how one publication unit speaks about that inherited moving lineage or governed move. It is not a standalone theory of documents, carriers, or publication forms.

#### E.17.AUD:4.4 - Kind and boundary

This pattern governs one publication unit as a readable unit. It does **not** treat that unit as automatically identical with:
- the `U.Episteme` or episteme species whose claims the unit carries, quotes, or describes;
- the `U.EpistemePublication` that carries episteme-publication identity;
- the primary described entity inside the unit;
- a generic publication face or governed MVPK face;
- a carrier or evidence carrier;
- proof, evidence record, assurance claim, or release support;
- a view or viewpoint;
- an engineering-process stage;
- a downstream decision, gate, work, or reliance publication.

Those may become relevant neighboring concerns, but they are not the problem situation being governed here just because the same note, sheet, or screen happens to mention them.

**Publication-unit boundary choice.** A `PublicationUnit` boundary is valid when a careful reader would naturally inspect that bounded item as carrying one primary publication move over one primary described entity, with one visible outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, reliance claim, or neighboring pattern application. Choose the bounded item that carries the live claim or effect being repaired. Do not choose a smaller boundary merely to hide a downstream overclaim, and do not choose a larger boundary merely to absorb several described entities into one unit. A table row may be the unit when that row carries the claim; the whole table may be the unit when the table-level caption or comparison frame carries the claim. A dashboard tile, note, card, sheet, or screen block may be the unit only when that bounded item, not the whole carrier or interface, carries the live publication move.

**Publication-unit snapshot identity.** A `PublicationUnit` may remain the same bounded unit while its carrier rendering, export format, screenshot, or layout changes. It does not remain the same stabilized reading by visual or file continuity alone. If a revision, refresh, translation, regeneration, or dashboard update changes the primary described entity, carried publication move, outside boundary, source pins, or admissible use, rerun the four-part reading for the new snapshot before the unit is used for comparison, explanation, evidence, gate, decision, work, or reliance claims.

#### E.17.AUD:4.5 - Ordinary working card

Use this seven-row card before you widen the repair:

| Row | Ordinary prompt |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | What is the governed unit being kept honest here? |
| 2 | What is that unit mainly about right now? |
| 3 | What carried publication move is it making over that primary described entity right now? |
| 4 | What downstream `U.Work`, `U.WorkPlanning`, decision, gate, or reliance claim still remains outside this unit, and is that boundary mainly a neighboring pattern application, downstream claim or effect, or ongoing engineering-process continuation? |
| 5 | Is the active problem situation still one overloaded local lexical head, whole-unit primary-described-entity stabilization, bounded comparison, or another neighboring pattern altogether? |
| 6 | Is the current form label (`note`, `sheet`, `table`, `screen`, and similar ordinary labels) naming only the presentation form, or is it quietly being used as if it changed the governed unit or the kind of downstream claim or effect readers are now inferring? |
| 7 | Does the current reading depend on a modeling basis to identify the primary described entity or carried publication move, and if so has that basis been published honestly enough for this unit? |

#### E.17.AUD:4.6 - Boundary and pattern-application rule

- If row 5 still points to one overloaded local lexical head, apply `Local Head Restoration`.
- If row 5 shows that the whole publication unit still cannot keep one stable primary described entity, one carried publication move, and one outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim visible, apply `PublicationUnit Primary Described-Entity Discipline`.
- If the publication unit is already stable enough and the real move is bounded comparison over already available source publications, apply `ComparativeReading`.
- If the main problem situation is explanation classification over an existing face, apply the neighboring explanation pattern rather than keeping the case inside publication-unit stability by inertia.
- If the active problem situation is publication form, bridge work, or downstream claim or effect, leave the publication-unit stability family and apply the more honest neighboring pattern or use the downstream publication.

#### E.17.AUD:4.7 - Local naming and lexical-governance rule

Treat ordinary labels such as `note`, `memo`, `sheet`, `table`, `screen`, `review`, and `status` as presentation-form clues, not as self-authenticating unit kinds.

Working rule:
- if one overloaded local lexical head is doing most of the semantic work, repair that local lexical head first through `Local Head Restoration`;
- if the local lexical head is not the real issue, keep the publication unit stable in the whole-unit stabilization pattern instead of hiding the reading shift under one more qualifier;
- do not let cleaner or more formal wording stand in for unsupported downstream claim or effect or unsupported comparison basis.

#### E.17.AUD:4.8 - Modeling-basis surfacing rule

If the primary described entity or the carried publication move depends on a modeling basis, publish that basis briefly in the unit or move the case to a heavier publication form or neighboring pattern that can carry it honestly. Do not let a formally loaded case pretend it is only prose hygiene.

#### E.17.AUD:4.9 - Load-bearing support dock

When the publication unit carries load-bearing explanation, comparison, or downstream claim or effect pressure, keep five quick support relations visible enough to preserve the repair disposition:
- evidence status and source-pin status when the unit leans on already available source publications;
- current admissible reliance or work reading and forbidden unsupported decision, work, or gate claim;
- whether this unit is the governing publication unit or a derivative helper publication;
- any load-bearing modeling basis;
- and that the assurance surface only tightens the opening recognition claim rather than silently broadening it into downstream claim or effect.

### E.17.AUD:5 - Worked slices

#### E.17.AUD:5.1 - Local-head case

A semio note keeps saying `this review` and `this interpretation`, but nobody can tell which FPF kind or locally declared head those lexical heads name here. The rest of the governed unit is still locally stable once the local lexical head is repaired. The honest move is not broad publication-unit stabilization. It is `Local Head Restoration`.

#### E.17.AUD:5.2 - Whole-unit reading-shift case

A memo starts about one bounded architecture question over an inherited lineage or move, then shifts into wider rollout or approval language without declaring the transition. Repairing one sentence does not stabilize the governed unit because the primary described entity and the carried publication move have both widened. The honest move is `PublicationUnit Primary Described-Entity Discipline`.

#### E.17.AUD:5.3 - Stable-unit comparison case

A comparison sheet already keeps one stable primary described entity and one clear outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim, but the team is using publication-unit instability language because the comparison is contentious. The honest move is not more publication-unit stabilization. It is `ComparativeReading`.

#### E.17.AUD:5.4 - Explanation-laundering case

An onboarding explainer starts from one stable source-pinned note, but then the simplified prose begins to sound like canonical assurance or policy. The publication unit may still be readable, yet the main problem situation is no longer publication-unit stability. The honest move is to leave publication-unit stability and apply `E.17.EFP ExplanationFaithfulnessProfile`.

#### E.17.AUD:5.5 - Downstream decision and reliance case

A status card starts as one bounded summary of progress, then quietly becomes the place where people infer approval, assignment, or go or no-go claim or effect. The problem is no longer only publication-unit stability. The honest move is to stop treating the card as if it were still only one neutral note and use the downstream decision, gate, work, or reliance publication.

#### E.17.AUD:5.6 - Compact scenario and anti-case pack

Use this quick contrast set when the first reading is still foggy:

| Near-miss case | What to look for | Honest governing pattern or project-side-reference boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LHR-only` | one overloaded local lexical head is doing most of the semantic work while the governed unit otherwise stays stable | apply `Local Head Restoration` |
| `whole-unit reading shift` | the governed unit quietly changes primary described entity or carried publication move | apply `PublicationUnit Primary Described-Entity Discipline` |
| `stable comparison -> CR` | the unit is already stable and the live problem situation is bounded comparison over pinned source publications | apply `ComparativeReading` |
| `downstream claim or effect overread` | readers are inferring approval, assignment, or go or no-go claim or effect from the publication unit | leave the publication-unit stability family for the more honest downstream decision, gate, work, or reliance publication |
| `modeling-lens hidden` | the unit only makes sense because of one unpublished model or formal basis | publish that basis briefly or use a heavier publication form or neighboring pattern |

### E.17.AUD:6 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | How to avoid it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixing one sentence while the whole unit already carries a quiet reading shift | local repair is asked to carry whole-unit stabilization | check primary described entity, carried publication move, and outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim before repairing the sentence |
| Treating form labels as if they changed the governed publication unit | `table`, `sheet`, or `screen` is used as if it already named a different ontology or downstream claim or effect | treat those as presentation forms first; only leave this pattern when the problem situation itself changes |
| Laundering comparison through stability language | teams keep saying the unit is unstable when the active problem situation is already bounded comparison | use the governing-pattern and project-side-reference boundary rule and apply `ComparativeReading` |
| Laundering downstream decision or reliance through clearer prose | a better-written note is over-read as if it had become an approval, gate, work, or reliance text | keep the outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim explicit and leave this pattern when downstream claim or effect appears |
| Letting three repair dispositions act at once | lexical-head repair, whole-unit stabilization, and neighboring governing-pattern application all get patched in parallel with no shared primary-described-entity reading | use the working card first and name one current repair disposition before patching the unit |

### E.17.AUD:7 - Consequences

- You slow down long enough to name the active publication-unit problem situation before patching the draft.
- You reduce pointless escalation from one overloaded local lexical head into a whole-unit rewrite.
- You reduce the opposite failure too: trying to solve whole-unit reading instability with one more qualifier on the same local lexical head.
- You keep neighboring publication-unit repair patterns and neighboring non-publication-unit patterns explicit instead of letting one broad stability name quietly absorb them.
- You make it harder for clearer prose, official-looking formatting, or wider circulation to masquerade as downstream claim or effect.

### E.17.AUD:8 - Rationale

`PublicationUnit Stability Discipline` is worth stating explicitly because local lexical-head repair and whole-unit primary-described-entity stabilization are both already real problem situations, but authors and reviewers still need one stabilization check that says when the case is local, when it is whole-unit, when it is already bounded comparison, and when it has left the publication-unit stability family entirely.

The pattern stays intentionally narrow. It does not turn every publication-unit problem into publication design or downstream decision, gate, work, or reliance work. Its job is simpler and more load-bearing: keep one publication unit honest enough that readers can still tell what it is mainly about, which carried publication move it makes, and which downstream `U.Work`, `U.WorkPlanning`, decision, gate, or reliance claim remains outside.

### E.17.AUD:9 - SoTA-Echoing

**Claim 1.** Best-known current architecture-description practice keeps the entity of interest and the description expressing it explicit enough that one document does not silently change its concern while still sounding continuous.

**Practice, source, alignment, and adoption.** Joint ISO, IEC, and IEEE 42010:2022 distinguishes the architecture of an entity from the architecture description that expresses it and requires explicit structure and concern handling. `PublicationUnit Stability Discipline` adopts that explicit concern discipline, adapts it from architecture descriptions to publication units more broadly, and rejects silent primary-described-entity shift inside one readable unit. For a reviewer or architect, this is the practical guard behind worked slices 5.2 and 5.3: one publication unit must not quietly shift concern and still be treated as one unchanged note.

**Claim 2.** Best-known current information-for-use practice treats user-facing units as purpose-bound, structured information rather than as loose bundles that can mix explanation, instruction, warning, and decision or reliance effect by convenience.

**Practice, source, alignment, and adoption.** Joint IEC and IEEE 82079-1:2019 requires information for use to be purpose-directed, structured, and evaluated for usability. `PublicationUnit Stability Discipline` adopts purpose-bound publication units and explicit outside boundaries to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim, adapts that discipline from information-for-use to notes, memos, sheets, tables, and screens, and rejects the shortcut where a clearer or official-looking unit is treated as if it had already become approval, policy, gate, work, or reliance text. For a manager or operator, this is the practical guard behind worked slices 5.4 and 5.5: better explanatory form does not itself mint downstream claim or effect.

**Claim 3.** Best-known current pattern-writing and pattern-validation practice keeps patterns tied to recognisable situations, explicit problem, solution, and consequence structure, and reviewable rationale rather than elegant internal naming alone.

**Practice, source, alignment, and adoption.** Iba (2021) and Riehle et al. (2020) both treat pattern writing and validation as requiring recognisable situations, explicit structure, and reviewable reasoning rather than only elegant naming. `PublicationUnit Stability Discipline` adopts worked slices, recognisable entry cues, and explicit governing-pattern and project-side-reference boundary discipline, adapts those expectations to publication-unit stability work, and rejects a pattern text that is cleanly labeled but domain-thin or reader-thin. For the current working reader, this is the practical guard behind the recognition surface and slices 5.1 through 5.5: the pattern should be usable before one has to reconstruct the surrounding rationale from scratch.

**Local stance.** The current SoTA claim is narrow. This pattern is not claiming one universal theory of documents. It claims a smaller and more practical point: one publication unit stays trustworthy only when its primary described entity, carried publication move, and outside boundary to work, work planning, decision, gate, or reliance claim remain explicit enough for cold readers to recover, and when neighboring problem situations are handled by their governing patterns rather than hidden.

### E.17.AUD:10 - Conformance Checklist

1. **CC-AUD-1 — One governed publication unit is explicit.**
   The case names one note, memo, sheet, table, screen, or short section as the governed unit rather than letting presentation-form labels stand in for the governed publication unit.
2. **CC-AUD-2 - Primary described entity and carried publication move are explicit enough to identify the governing pattern.**
   The case keeps visible which primary described entity the unit is about and which carried publication move it performs over that described entity right now.
3. **CC-AUD-3 — Outside-work boundary is explicit.**
   The case states what downstream `U.Work`, `U.WorkPlanning`, decision, gate, or reliance claim still remains outside the governed unit, including neighboring pattern application, downstream claim or effect, or ongoing engineering-process continuation when that distinction matters.
4. **CC-AUD-4 — The active repair disposition is named honestly.**
   The case makes explicit whether the live problem situation is local lexical-head repair, whole-unit primary-described-entity stabilization, bounded comparison, or another neighboring pattern rather than patching several problem situations at once under one vague stability claim.
5. **CC-AUD-5 - Repair-disposition and governing-pattern boundary choice is explicit.**
   When the problem situation belongs with `Local Head Restoration`, `PublicationUnit Primary Described-Entity Discipline`, `ComparativeReading`, a neighboring explanation-faithfulness pattern, or a downstream decision, gate, work, or reliance publication, that governing FPF pattern or exact project-side FPF kind and reference is explicit rather than hidden inside broad-family wording.
6. **CC-AUD-6 — Presentation-form labels do not launder governed-unit kind or downstream claim or effect.**
   `note`, `memo`, `sheet`, `table`, `screen`, and similar labels remain presentation-form clues and do not silently change the governed unit, create proof, create evidence, create release support, or mint downstream claim or effect.
7. **CC-AUD-7 - Load-bearing modeling basis is published or handled by a governing publication form.**
   If the primary described entity or carried publication move depends on a modeling basis, that basis is published briefly enough for review or the case is handled by a heavier publication form or neighboring pattern that can carry it honestly.
8. **CC-AUD-8 — Clearer prose does not silently widen downstream claim or effect.**
   Readability, formatting, and wider circulation may improve the unit, but they do not by themselves turn the unit into approval, policy, assignment, gate, work, or reliance text.

- **Builds on:** `A.7`, `E.10`, `F.18`, `E.14`, `E.19`, `E.17`, and `C.2.1`.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.17.AUD.LHR Local Head Restoration`, `E.17.AUD.OOTD PublicationUnit Primary Described-Entity Discipline`, `E.17.ID.CR ComparativeReading`, `E.17.EFP ExplanationFaithfulnessProfile`, and `E.21` when a pattern-quality card, table, status line, or generated summary is published as a bounded publication unit. `E.17.AUD` governs publication-unit honesty; `E.21` governs the underlying pattern-quality claim. Also coordinates with project-side FPF patterns such as `C.11`, `A.10`, `A.15`, `A.15.4`, `B.3`, `A.20`, and `A.21` when decision, evidence, gate, assurance, engineering-justification, work, or reliance claims become primary.
- **Boundary consequence:** when the publication unit can no longer stay honest inside this publication-unit stability pattern, apply the neighboring FPF pattern or name the exact project-side FPF kind and reference instead of treating publication-unit stability as a general explanation, comparison, decision, gate, work, or reliance discipline.
