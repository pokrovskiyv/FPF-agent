## E.9.DA - DRR Decision-Adequacy Evaluation CharacteristicSpace

> **Type:** Definitional pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

### E.9.DA:1 - Problem frame

Use `E.9.DA` when one `DRR` must become reliable enough for a declared FPF authoring use: pattern drafting, host amendment, receiving-locus distribution, accepted-decision carry-through, source-use carry-through, narrowing decision, split decision, or architecture-hold decision.

Use it especially when the `DRR` already follows `E.9` section shape but authors still disagree about whether the decision is decisive enough, carried by value, lexically exact enough, and actionable enough for pattern-host writing.

**Not this pattern when.** Use `E.9` to write the `DRR` kind and minimum decision-rationale form. Use `E.21` when the evaluated object is one authored FPF pattern version and the live claim is pattern quality. Use `E.19` when the evaluated object is one FPF pattern admission or refresh review. Use `E.10` when the live problem is lexical trigger repair in the `DRR` text. Use `C.16`, `A.17`, `A.18`, and `A.19` when the live problem is measurement legality, Characteristic and Scale discipline, or a general `CharacteristicSpace`.

**First useful move.** Name the bounded `DRR` version being evaluated, the declared `DRR` authoring use it is meant to carry, and the first pattern-drafting decision that would fail if the `DRR` stayed vague.

**Pattern-version handoff.** If the evaluated object is one FPF pattern version, do not start with `E.9.DA`. Start with the `E.21` fast reader move loop: name `<PatternVersionRef> for <WorkingReaderScope> under <IntendedUse> within <QualificationWindow>`, then read only the pattern's `Problem frame` and `Solution` until the first admissible action-guiding move is recoverable. Open `E.9.DA` only when the live blocker is whether an upstream `DRR` is decision-bearing enough for the pattern authoring use.

**Improvement-oriented quality-read question framing.** An `E.9.DA` read may cite an `E.22` `QualityReadQuestionFrame` when the caller needs to distinguish drafting-floor adequacy, exceptional decision-adequacy improvement, Pareto trade-off inspection, open-question discovery, or returned-finding absorption. If no purpose is declared, the ordinary default is a floor read for the declared downstream authoring use, not maximal DRR improvement.

**Ordinary-cost posture.** `E.9.DA` is not a preliminary audit before every pattern-quality read, admission review, or local wording repair. It opens only when a `DRR` decision-adequacy claim is live and a downstream author would otherwise have to invent a missing decision.

**Cheap stop.** If the `DRR` only records a small local editorial decision and no downstream pattern drafting or cross-pattern distribution depends on it, do not create a full adequacy read. Apply `E.9` directly and run `E.10` only for live wording.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A formally valid `DRR` can still be too weak for drafting: it may summarize sources instead of deciding, leave neighbour patterns as unclassified receiving loci, hide rejected alternatives, use broad trigger words as if they were exact kinds, or omit the practical drafting action that the decision is supposed to enable.

**What this buys.** `E.9.DA` gives authors and reviewers one compact way to say whether a `DRR` is admissible for the declared authoring use, admissible only after narrowing, still needs repair before drafting, must split into several decisions, or must hold for architecture decision.

**Governed object in plain terms.** The governed object is the `DRR` decision-adequacy claim for one exact `DRR` version under one declared authoring use.

**Primary working reader.** The first reader is an FPF author, reviewer, or steward who must decide whether pattern drafting can rely on the `DRR` without inventing missing decisions. The downstream reader is the pattern author who will turn the accepted decision into user-facing FPF pattern text.

### E.9.DA:2 - Problem

`E.9` defines the kind and content obligations of a `DRR`, but it is not itself a stop rule for improving one concrete `DRR`. In practice, weak `DRR`s often pass a shape check and still fail for the declared authoring use.

Recurring failures:

1. **Decision summarization.** The record describes source material but does not select what FPF should say.
2. **Disposition gaps.** Selected, rejected, inherited, and outside-decision alternatives are not closed by value.
3. **Neighbour drift.** Related patterns are mentioned but not assigned exact amendment, non-amendment, or receiving-locus obligations.
4. **Drafting inactionability.** Pattern authors cannot tell which sections, names, examples, checks, or relations to write.
5. **Lexical under-typing.** Words such as `basis`, `support`, `quality`, `architecture`, `profile`, `source`, `view`, `decision`, `adequacy`, or `readiness` carry load without recovered kind, relation, or admissible use.
6. **Scope fog.** The `DRR` leaves one content decision partly unmade while implying that pattern drafting may settle it.
7. **Source theatre.** Sources, reviews, audits, standards, benchmarks, or SoTA references are listed but do not change the selected answer, boundary, example, validation obligation, or reopen condition.
8. **Pattern-quality confusion.** Authors try to evaluate the `DRR` as if it were an `E.21` pattern-quality object under evaluation, or treat a passed `E.19` pattern review as proof that the upstream `DRR` was adequate.
9. **Architecture-by-addressing.** The `DRR` names exact receiving loci, but does not judge whether the selected FPF content architecture is adequate: existing pattern vs new pattern, split vs merge, pattern body vs selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair, or neighbour-governed vs local content.
10. **Hidden source loss.** The `DRR` compresses, extracts, summarizes, clusters, diagrams, graphs, or dashboard-renders source material without saying which distinctions were preserved, lost, non-admissible for downstream use, or recoverable only by returning to the fuller source.

### E.9.DA:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Decision completeness vs concise rationale** | A `DRR` must carry enough decisions by value, but it should not become the enduring pattern text. |
| **Exactness vs drafting freedom** | The `DRR` must fix selected answers and boundaries, while pattern authors still need room to write usable pattern prose. |
| **Source preservation vs synthesis** | Exact source material matters, but the `DRR` must state FPF decisions rather than remain a source packet. |
| **Multi-pattern coordination vs governed-object boundary** | One decision may touch several patterns, but each evaluation pattern keeps its governed object boundary and local invariants. |
| **Architecture selection vs address completion** | A `DRR` may assign every receiving locus while still choosing the wrong split, merge, governed object, branch, or neighbour-governance boundary. |
| **Lexical precision vs authoring cost** | High-pressure wording must be repaired enough for drafting, without turning every `DRR` into a full lexicon. |
| **Stop discipline vs open improvement** | A `DRR` can always be made richer, but drafting needs a declared adequacy threshold for the current authoring use. |
| **Ordinary-cost first pass vs full read** | The first authoring question may need only one blocker and one repair locus; a multi-pattern or SoTA-heavy decision may need the full coordinate read. |
| **No scalar score vs practical verdict** | Authors need a clear result, but averaging coordinates would hide hard decision defects. |

### E.9.DA:4 - Solution

State the scoped decision-adequacy read as a `DRRDecisionAdequacyRead`, not as one score.

#### E.9.DA:4.1 - Architectural position

`E.9.DA` is a local characteristic-space pattern for `DRR` decision adequacy. It specializes existing FPF architecture and does not create a general quality ontology, a review gate, or a second `DRR` form.

It reads whether one `DRR` version can serve one declared authoring use:

- drafting one or more FPF pattern hosts;
- amending one existing pattern;
- distributing one accepted decision across selected patterns and selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pairs;
- carrying source-use or accepted-decision payload into receiving loci;
- deciding whether drafting must stop for `DRR` repair, decision split, or architecture decision.

`E.9.DA` governs only these questions:

1. Which exact `DRR` version is being read?
2. For which declared authoring use, receiving-locus disposition map, and read qualification window?
3. Which hard blockers make coordinate comparison meaningless?
4. Which decision-adequacy coordinates are active?
5. Which `DRR` loci justify those coordinate readings?
6. Which `DRRDecisionAdequacyStatus` follows?
7. What repair, narrowed use, split, or architecture decision is required before drafting can rely on the `DRR`?

It does not govern:

- writing the `DRR` form itself (`E.9`);
- writing pattern bodies (`E.8`);
- evaluating pattern-quality claims (`E.21`);
- running pattern admission or refresh reviews (`E.19`);
- general lexical repair (`E.10`, `A.6.P`, `C.2.P`);
- measurement legality or arbitrary quality-family unpacking (`C.16`, `A.17`, `A.18`, `A.19`, `C.25`, `C.16.P`);
- project evidence, assurance, gate, work, release, safety, security, or compliance claims.

#### E.9.DA:4.1a - Name ontology, local name classes, and E.10 closure

`E.9.DA` introduces local authoring-plane names. They are not kernel `U.*` types, operational gates, assurance records, evidence roles, release states, or durable cross-pattern names unless a separate FPF decision promotes one through `F.18`.

| Name class | Local names | Ontological role | Non-use boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pattern id and title | `E.9.DA`, `DRRDecisionAdequacyEvaluationCharacteristicSpace` | Pattern id and local characteristic-space specialization for `DRR` decision adequacy. | Not a general quality ontology, not a DRR form, not a review gate. |
| Read record | `DRRDecisionAdequacyRead` | Local authored adequacy-read record for one scoped ordinal read of one `DRR` decision-adequacy claim. | Not a `DRR`, not an `E.19` review profile, not an authored pattern version, not a gate decision, not an evidence record. |
| Field heads | `DRRVersionRef`, `DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse`, `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap`, `DRRReadQualificationWindow`, `DRRCoordinateLocusRefs`, `DRRSourceUseDischargeMap`, `StopOrRepairCondition` | Local fields inside one adequacy read. | Not source documents, project objects, work queues, release windows, review states, or A.10 evidence records. |
| Derived projection | `DRRReceivingLocusSet` | Convenience projection equal to the keys of `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap`. | Orientation only; not adequacy-bearing by itself. |
| Eligibility predicates | `DRRDecisionAdequacyEligibilitySet` rows such as `boundedDecisionQuestionRecoverable` and `downstreamActionRecoverable` | Hard filters checked before coordinate comparison. | Not soft scores, not gates, not review profiles. |
| Coordinate heads | `BoundedDecisionQuestionRecoverability`, `SelectedAnswerDecisiveness`, `FPFContentArchitectureSelectionAdequacy`, and the other `E.9.DA:4.5` heads | Local decision-adequacy characteristic heads inside the local characteristic space. | Not general FPF numeric measures, maturity dimensions, or measurement templates unless a neighboring measurement declaration is live. |
| Status values | `admissibleForDeclaredAuthoringUse`, `admissibleForNarrowedAuthoringUse`, `repairBeforeDrafting`, `splitDecisionRequired`, `holdForArchitectureDecision` | Local admissible-use posture for the `DRR` decision-adequacy claim. | Not project status, release state, gate decision, assurance level, or pattern-quality result. |

Local names may be reused outside `E.9.DA` only as thin echoes pointing back to this pattern. A name that becomes durable across several patterns needs an `F.18` card, a glossary or UTS posture when applicable, and a new decision record that states the cross-pattern kind.

The names above survive the `E.10` replacement-candidate anti-umbrella rule because each one names a local field, local authored adequacy-read record, local characteristic-space specialization, or local value set with an explicit governed object and non-use boundary. A replacement candidate that would reintroduce `basis`, `support`, `route`, `kind`, `record`, `quality`, `source`, `view`, `mapping`, or another context-free head is not accepted unless the same ontology is recoverable by value.

#### E.9.DA:4.1b - Architectural relation and governing-neighbour boundary

`E.9.DA` answers exactly one adequacy question: whether one `E.9`-governed `DRR` version is decision-bearing enough for the declared FPF authoring use. When a neighbouring claim is live, `E.9.DA` names the exact evaluation pattern and its limited relation instead of becoming the neighbouring pattern.

| Live object or claim | Governing pattern | `E.9.DA` relation |
|---|---|---|
| `DRR` form and minimum decision-rationale content | `E.9` | Reads adequacy of one concrete `DRR`; does not create a second DRR form. |
| Authored pattern body | `E.8` | Reads whether the upstream decision is authoring-bearing enough; does not write the body. |
| Pattern-quality claim over one pattern version | `E.21` | Opens only when a pattern-quality blocker traces to a missing, vague, unassigned, source-theatre, or architecture-by-addressing upstream DRR decision. |
| Pattern admission or refresh review | `E.19` | Uses returned findings only when they identify upstream DRR decision defects; does not turn review pass, return, or absence into coordinate evidence. |
| Lexical, relation, epistemic, or characteristic-scale precision repair | `E.10`, `A.6.P`, `C.2.P`, `C.16.P`, `F.18` | Requires the exact repair pattern when a live name, relation, source-transfer, episteme, or scale construction needs it. |
| Measurement, characteristic, scale, quality-family, or formal-lens legality | `C.16`, `A.17`, `A.18`, `A.19`, `C.25`, `C.16.Q` | Names the neighbouring pattern and limited reliance; does not make ordinal adequacy readings into measurements. |
| Evidence, assurance, gate, work, release, safety, security, compliance, or project certification | `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `A.15`, and the exact evaluation pattern when live | Blocks the overread that a DRR adequacy result is project-world proof, assurance, gate passage, release authority, safety acceptance, or compliance certification. |
| Architecture-facing source, structural view, graph, diagram, ADR-like note, dashboard, or publication face | The exact architecture, publication, graph, view, or source-use pattern when live | Reads whether the `DRR` states source-use posture, affected structures, structure kinds, architecture structural views, view losses, source-return conditions, splits among architecture decision, architecture description, and publication, and graph, view, or ADR non-use boundaries. |

#### E.9.DA:4.2 - DRRDecisionAdequacyRead

`DRRDecisionAdequacyRead := <DRRVersionRef, DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse, DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap, DRRReadQualificationWindow, DRRDecisionAdequacyEligibilitySet, ActiveDecisionAdequacyCoordinates, DRRCoordinateLocusRefs, DRRSourceUseDischargeMap?, DRRDecisionAdequacyStatus, StopOrRepairCondition>`

Field roles:

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `DRRVersionRef` | Exact `DRR` version being evaluated. A title alone is not enough when several drafts, intakes, or review mirrors exist. |
| `DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse` | What the `DRR` adequacy read is allowed to carry: `patternDrafting`, `hostAmendment`, `receivingLocusDistribution`, `acceptedDecisionCarryThrough`, `sourceUseCarryThrough`, `narrowingDecision`, or `splitOrArchitectureHoldDecision`. `internalReview` is not a standalone use; a review may ask for `E.9.DA` only by naming the authoring-bearing use whose reliance would fail. |
| `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap` | Adequacy-bearing map from each exact evaluation pattern or selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair to its disposition, content obligation or non-obligation, governing-neighbour relation, sibling decision reference, and first drafting implication when content is received. |
| `DRRReceivingLocusSet` | Derived projection: `keys(DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap)`. It is sufficient for orientation, but not sufficient for adequacy. |
| `DRRReadQualificationWindow` | The edition, source set, accepted-decision record, neighboring-pattern condition, and currentness condition under which the read is valid. It is not a release window, evidence currentness claim, review state, or gate window unless the exact neighbour makes that live. |
| `DRRDecisionAdequacyEligibilitySet` | Hard filters that must pass before coordinate comparison is meaningful. |
| `ActiveDecisionAdequacyCoordinates` | The selected decision-adequacy coordinates used for the scoped read. |
| `DRRCoordinateLocusRefs` | Exact `DRR` sections, rows, alternatives, source-use rows, accepted-decision rows, validation rows, examples, anti-cases, or other `DRR` loci used to justify coordinate readings. It is not an `A.10` evidence record, assurance path, project evidence, or administrative proof. |
| `DRRSourceUseDischargeMap?` | Optional field active when a source, workstream plan, campaign queue, review packet, external standard, article, ADR-like note, benchmark, expert claim, or prior accepted decision is load-bearing. It states source posture, selected payload, rejected or non-carried payload, still-live uncertainty, blocked authority overread, and receiving locus. |
| `DRRDecisionAdequacyStatus` | The resulting admissible-use posture for the `DRR` decision-adequacy claim. |
| `StopOrRepairCondition` | The explicit reason improvement may stop, or the first repair, narrowing, split, or architecture decision required. |

`DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap` rows use these dispositions: `amended`, `receivesContentObligation`, `governsOnly`, `outsideCurrentDecision`, `siblingDecision`, and `intentionallyUnamended`. Each row states at least one exact locus reference and either a selected content obligation or an explicit non-obligation and outside-current-decision boundary.

`DRRSourceUseDischargeMap?` rows use content-role source postures: `landedCoreAuthority`, `acceptedDecisionSource`, `acceptedPlanningSource`, `reviewReturnSource`, `sourcePublication`, `externalSource`, `lineageOnly`, `rationaleOnly`, `livingOrRefreshableNonSoTASource`, and `rejectedSource`. Process provenance such as workstream, campaign queue, review packet, or architecture queue belongs in exact source references or process files, not in FPF-level source-posture names. A source, plan, review packet, architecture queue, ADR-like note, standard, benchmark, or article does not become FPF doctrine merely by being cited.

#### E.9.DA:4.3 - DRRDecisionAdequacyEligibilitySet

A first-pass `E.9.DA` read always checks these hard filters when the corresponding load is live:

| Eligibility row | Pass condition | Failure result |
|---|---|---|
| `boundedDecisionQuestionRecoverable` | The `DRR` states the bounded FPF content decision question and does not leave the same question to drafting. | `repairBeforeDrafting` or `splitDecisionRequired`. |
| `selectedAnswerPresent` | The selected answer says what FPF will do, which loci it changes, and what is not selected. | `repairBeforeDrafting`. |
| `sourceUseAndDecisionInheritanceRecoverable` | Exact source use, accepted decision records, workstream, queue, and source posture, governing inheritance, selected payload, rejected payload, still-live uncertainty, and blocked authority overread are named by value. A source, plan, review packet, architecture queue, ADR-like note, or external standard does not become FPF doctrine merely by being cited. | `repairBeforeDrafting`, or `splitDecisionRequired` when several source payloads require separate decisions. |
| `receivingLocusDispositionPresent` | Selected patterns and selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pairs have content obligations and non-obligations in `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap`. | `repairBeforeDrafting` or `holdForArchitectureDecision`. |
| `lexicalTriggerClosurePresent` | Load-bearing high-pressure wording is repaired by `E.10`, `A.6.P`, `C.2.P`, `F.18`, or the exact evaluation pattern, or is marked ordinary use or non-use. | `repairBeforeDrafting`. |
| `downstreamActionRecoverable` | A pattern author can recover the first drafting move without inventing a missing decision. | `repairBeforeDrafting`. |

#### E.9.DA:4.4 - Ordinal coordinate scale

`DRRDecisionAdequacyEvaluationCharacteristicSpace` is the declared characteristic space for `DRR` decision-adequacy reads. It uses ordinal coordinates. The default scale is the neutral zero-based six-value ordinal scale reused from `E.21`.

A coordinate value in `DRRDecisionAdequacyEvaluationCharacteristicSpace` is an ordinal `DRR` decision-adequacy reading, not a `U.Measure` by default. It becomes a measurement claim only when a neighbouring `C.16`, `A.17`, `A.18`, or `A.19` declaration explicitly supplies the measurement template, scale, unit, comparability mode, and evidence role. Otherwise the value is an evidence-backed ordinal judgement over the exact `DRR` text and declared authoring use.

| Value | Label | Meaning for a `DRR` decision-adequacy coordinate |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `absent` | The coordinate is not expressed in the `DRR` for the declared authoring use. |
| 1 | `namedOnly` | The coordinate is named or implied, but the reader cannot use it as decision evidence. |
| 2 | `partiallyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | The coordinate is expressed in one or more loci, but the expression is incomplete, fragile, or too narrow for the declared authoring use. |
| 3 | `sufficientlyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | The coordinate is expressed enough to carry the declared authoring use, with known limits kept visible. |
| 4 | `wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` | The coordinate is clearly and repeatedly expressed across the `DRR`, with direct evidence and boundary protection. |
| 5 | `exceptionallyExpressedForDeclaredUse` | The coordinate is expressed exceptionally well for the declared authoring use, across multiple reinforcing loci and cases, without hiding cost or neighbouring-pattern loss. |

The scale is zero-based because true absence is not a weak positive value. It uses six ordinal values rather than ten because the read is ordinal: the values distinguish absence, mere naming, partial expression, sufficiency, well-expressed form, and exceptional expression without pretending to have decimal-grade precision. The labels are intentionally domain-neutral. They describe degree of expression of whichever coordinate is being read; they do not import a substantive property such as robustness, completeness, correctness, architectural soundness, evidence strength, drafting usability, or review maturity into every coordinate.

The scale normalization rule is: all active `E.9.DA` coordinates use the same neutral ordinal value set and the same content-evidence test before any comparison. A coordinate-specific named scale may be used only when a more specific neighbouring `C.16`, `A.17`, `A.18`, or `A.19` construction is live; it does not silently translate into the default ordinal value set, and the read must state any declared comparability or non-comparability relation. Otherwise no arithmetic mean, percentage score, hidden normalization, maturity ranking, or single total order is admissible.

Scale orthogonalization does not mean inventing coordinate-specific value labels such as robust, safe, mature, strong, complete, or well-architected. The value labels stay neutral; the coordinate name and reading carry the subject matter. Orthogonality is achieved by separating the decision properties being read and by stating activation conditions, failure modes, and repair questions for each coordinate.

The ordinal value of a coordinate is a content reading. `FPFContentArchitectureSelectionAdequacy = 3` means the selected content architecture is sufficiently expressed for the declared authoring use; it does not mean "not yet externally reviewed." `FPFContentArchitectureSelectionAdequacy = 5` means that same coordinate is exceptionally expressed in the current `DRR` text; it does not mean "already landed." The same `DRR` text in a campaign file, review packet, copied excerpt, or monolith-adjacent carrier should receive the same coordinate value unless the text, `DRRVersionRef`, declared authoring use, source set, or `DRRReadQualificationWindow` changes.

For `admissibleForDeclaredAuthoringUse` that authorizes downstream drafting, host amendment, or multi-locus distribution, the default declared floor is `4 wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` on every active coordinate. This default floor does not apply to ordinary-cost first pass, small local editorial `DRR`s, non-ready statuses, or a narrowed read whose `DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse` explicitly lowers the reliance claim. If a different floor is declared, the read states `DeclaredAdequacyFloor`, why it is sufficient for the narrowed authoring use, and the prohibited broader use.

#### E.9.DA:4.4a - Coordinate value evidence test

A coordinate value is justified by content evidence, not by the label alone. The ordinary `4 wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` test is:

1. the coordinate names the exact `DRR` decision property being read;
2. the `DRR` text contains direct loci for that property;
3. at least one positive case and one boundary or anti-case exercise the property when the declared authoring use reaches beyond one local edit;
4. receiving-locus relations or non-use boundaries protect the property from overread;
5. SoTA, source material, review findings, standards, benchmarks, expert claims, or internal FPF architecture changes at least one selected answer, receiving-locus obligation, validation obligation, worked case, architecture choice, stop condition, or reopen condition when the coordinate depends on those materials;
6. the coordinate evidence does not depend on review completion, landing state, monolith placement, release state, or steward acceptance.

A `5 exceptionallyExpressedForDeclaredUse` value requires the `4` test plus additional content evidence in the `DRR` itself: multiple reinforcing loci, heterogeneous cases or anti-cases where the coordinate changes the result, explicit non-use boundary, and no hidden authoring-cost, neighbour-ripple, source-loss, shadow-spec, or proxy-for-value loss. Absence of completed downstream pattern prose, review, landing, or release is not evidence against `5`; only missing or weak `DRR` decision content for the declared use can lower the coordinate.

`3 sufficientlyExpressedForDeclaredUse` means the coordinate is usable for the declared authoring use but lacks one or more conditions required for `4` or `5`. Coordinate value and locus references remain distinct: a value says the declared expression degree for the coordinate; `DRRCoordinateLocusRefs` say why that reading is justified.

#### E.9.DA:4.4b - Decision-content evidence vs reputation signals

Coordinate values read `DRR` decision content for the declared authoring use. Reviewer praise, reviewer acceptance, reviewer-clean packets, number of reviews, steward acceptance, campaign progress, landing state, monolith placement, release inclusion, source volume, citation volume, popularity, adoption, awards, prior use, or absence of those signals is not a decision-adequacy value and does not raise or lower a coordinate by itself.

Such signals may only point to exact `DRR` content evidence. A reviewer finding may change `SelectedAnswerDecisiveness` when it identifies an undecided alternative, or may change `FPFContentArchitectureSelectionAdequacy` when it identifies a wrong split, merge, or receiving-locus decision. The coordinate changes because the `DRR` decision content changed or was shown to be weak, not because a review event occurred.

Absence of review, use, landing, release, or steward acceptance is not evidence against `4` or `5`. Only missing or weak `DRR` decision content for the declared authoring use can lower the coordinate. The same `DRR` text under the same `DRRVersionRef`, `DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse`, source set, receiving-locus disposition map, and `DRRReadQualificationWindow` should receive the same coordinate value whether it is new, reviewed, landed, praised, ignored, or copied into another carrier.

#### E.9.DA:4.4c - SoTA decision-mutation rule

When `SoTAAndEvidenceUseInDecision`, `SourceUseAndDecisionInheritanceCarryThrough`, or `DRRSourceUseDischargeMap?` is active, a source, standard, review, audit, benchmark, expert claim, or prior accepted decision is decision-bearing only if the `DRR` states:

1. exact source or accepted-decision reference;
2. currentness posture: `currentSoTA`, `livingOrRefreshableNonSoTASource`, `lineageOnly`, `localAcceptedDecision`, `rationaleOnly`, or `rejectedPopularPractice`;
3. stance: `adopt`, `adapt`, `reject`, or `lineageOnly`;
4. exact `DRR` payload changed: selected answer, receiving-locus obligation, rejected alternative, non-use boundary, worked case, conformance item, validation obligation, architecture split or merge choice, `StopOrRepairCondition`, or reopen condition;
5. most expansive unsupported overread blocked.

Here `currentSoTA` has the E.8 meaning: current best-known problem-solving practice for the governed problem. A source, standard, benchmark, review, or expert claim is not `currentSoTA` merely because it is official, recent, popular, widely adopted, highly cited, or familiar; if it does not carry the current best-known answer, the posture is lineage-only, living or refreshable but not SoTA-bearing, local accepted decision, rejected popular practice, or rationale-only for this read.

If no payload changes, the material is rationale-only or lineage-only for this read. It must not raise a coordinate value, justify `admissibleForDeclaredAuthoringUse`, or become an unstated FPF decision.


#### E.9.DA:4.5 - Decision-adequacy coordinates

The default coordinate menu is activation-normalized. Inactive coordinates are outside the current read; they are not passes or hidden failures.

Coordinate heads in `E.9.DA:4.5` are local decision-adequacy characteristic heads inside `DRRDecisionAdequacyEvaluationCharacteristicSpace`. They do not become general FPF characteristics, numeric measures, maturity dimensions, or measurement templates unless a neighbouring `C.16`, `A.17`, `A.18`, or `A.19` declaration makes that live.

| Coordinate | Activation | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| `BoundedDecisionQuestionRecoverability` | Always active for substantive `DRR`s. | Can the reader recover the exact FPF content decision question and know which adjacent questions are outside it? |
| `SelectedAnswerDecisiveness` | Always active for substantive `DRR`s. | Does the `DRR` decide the selected answer now rather than promise selection during drafting? |
| `SourceUseAndDecisionInheritanceCarryThrough` | Active when source, intake, audit, review, SoTA, standard, benchmark, expert claim, or accepted decision inheritance governs the decision. | Does the `DRR` carry the needed source use or accepted decision inheritance by value and state how it changes the selected answer, boundary, receiving-locus obligation, validation obligation, worked case, architecture choice, stop condition, or reopen condition? |
| `AlternativeDispositionCompleteness` | Active when alternatives, reviewer proposals, neighbouring patterns, rejected practices, or rejected names are materially live. | Are selected, rejected, inherited, lineage-only, rationale-only, and outside-decision options closed with exact dispositions? |
| `ReceivingLocusObligationClosure` | Active when more than one pattern or selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair is touched. | Does `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap` assign obligations and non-obligations to exact loci without stealing neighbour authority or leaving an unclassified receiving locus? |
| `FPFContentArchitectureSelectionAdequacy` | Active when the `DRR` selects a new pattern, existing pattern, split, merge, governed object, branch, receiving-locus disposition map, selected companion publication, or selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair. | Is the selected FPF content architecture adequate, not merely explicit: does it preserve the governed object, avoid false split or merge, avoid overloading neighbours, justify rejected architecture choices, prevent shadow-spec and companion-publication authority, and keep durable content in the right FPF loci? |
| `ArchitectureSourceAndViewLossClosure` | Active when architecture-facing source, structural view, diagram, graph, dashboard, ADR-like note, architecture description, or source plan is load-bearing. | Does the `DRR` state affected structures, structure kinds, architecture structural views, view losses, source-return conditions, splits among architecture decision, architecture description, and publication, and graph, view, or ADR non-use boundaries? |
| `DraftingActionability` | Always active when pattern drafting or host amendment follows. | Can a pattern author recover the first drafting move and the content obligations to write in affected sections, names, examples, conformance items, and Relations rows, without requiring the `DRR` to contain final pattern prose? |
| `LexicalAndNamingClosure` | Active when the `DRR` mints names, rejects names, or uses high-pressure terms load-bearing. | Are durable names, trigger words, and relation-like heads closed through `E.10`, `F.18`, `A.6.P`, `C.2.P`, or exact evaluation patterns? |
| `SoTAAndEvidenceUseInDecision` | Active when SoTA, literature, empirical material, review findings, standards, benchmarks, or expert opinion is load-bearing. | Does each source change a selected answer, rejected alternative, receiving-locus obligation, boundary, example, validation obligation, architecture choice, stop condition, or reopen condition? |
| `ScopeBoundaryAndNonOverread` | Always active for substantive `DRR`s; especially active when the `DRR` relies on compression, extraction, coarsening, evidence reuse, many-to-many allocation, graph clustering, generated relation graphs, dashboards, summaries, source packets, or architecture views that can hide action-relevant distinctions. | Are outside-decision items, non-admissible overreads, source-return path, lost distinctions, and claims above the current decision blocked without hidden undecided content claims? |
| `ConsequencesAndRegressionCoverage` | Active when the decision changes patterns, names, examples, checks, user action, source use, or architecture-facing views. | Are consequences, costs, validation obligations, source-loss regressions, regression cases, and near-misses enough to protect downstream drafting? |
| `SiblingDecisionCoordination` | Active when another `DRR`, accepted decision record, or evaluation pattern governs a neighbouring issue. | Does the `DRR` state the coordination relation without duplicating or weakening the sibling decision? |
| `AdministrativeStateAndAuthoringHistorySeparation` | Active when sources, reviews, process handoff files, release posture, transport files, landing state, monolith placement, chat history, or authoring history are near the content decision. | Does the `DRR` keep review logistics, handoff state, packet state, landing state, monolith placement, release posture, chat history, authoring history, and other administrative state from serving as selected answer, coordinate locus, source-use proof, gate result, review result, or adequacy evidence? |
| `CorpusEcologyAndShadowSpecResistance` | Active when the accepted read can create duplicate trigger lists, shadow specs, repeated restoration doctrine, retrieval confusion, migration cost, neighbouring-pattern ambiguity, or durable-name fanout. | Does the `DRR` protect corpus ecology by assigning repeated doctrine to the governing pattern, preventing duplicate local variants, and naming the smallest receiving locus for each live content obligation? |

The coordinate set is orthogonalized by repair question, not by distinct vocabulary alone. `ReceivingLocusObligationClosure` reads whether exact loci and obligations are assigned. `FPFContentArchitectureSelectionAdequacy` reads whether those selected loci and split or merge choices are architecturally adequate. `DraftingActionability` reads whether a pattern author can turn the accepted decision into sections, names, examples, checks, and relations. The same `DRR` section may be cited by several coordinates, but a value cannot be raised in one coordinate by evidence that only repairs another coordinate. When two proposed coordinates always fail and repair together, merge them or state the subreadings; when they fail independently and require different repairs, keep them separate.

#### E.9.DA:4.6 - DRRDecisionAdequacyStatus

`DRRDecisionAdequacyStatus` is an admissible-use posture for the `DRR` decision-adequacy claim. It is not a project gate, release state, assurance level, or pattern-quality result.

| Status | Meaning | Required payload |
|---|---|---|
| `admissibleForDeclaredAuthoringUse` | The `DRR` can be used for the declared drafting, amendment, distribution, accepted-decision carry-through, or source-use carry-through. | `DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse`, `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap`, active coordinates, declared floor, bounded non-use, and stop condition. |
| `admissibleForNarrowedAuthoringUse` | The `DRR` can be used only after narrowing the decision, authoring use, receiving loci, source-use claim, accepted-decision inheritance, or receiving-locus disposition map by value. | Exact narrowed scope, declared floor if changed, and prohibited broader use. |
| `repairBeforeDrafting` | One or more eligibility rows or active coordinate floors fail. | First repair locus and downstream use whose drafting would fail. |
| `splitDecisionRequired` | The `DRR` contains several coupled but not-yet-decided questions that need separate decision records or explicit convergence. | Split boundary and which decision can proceed, if any. |
| `holdForArchitectureDecision` | The defect is not local wording; the governed object, branch, neighbour-governance boundary, receiving locus, structural view relation, source-return condition, or split among architecture decision, architecture description, and publication must be decided before adequacy can close. | Exact unresolved architecture question and candidate evaluation patterns. |

#### E.9.DA:4.6a - Ordinary-cost first pass

For ordinary authoring use, the first pass is intentionally smaller than the full work order.

1. Name the exact `DRRVersionRef`, the declared `DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse`, and the first pattern-drafting decision that would fail if the `DRR` stayed vague.
2. Check only the live hard blockers needed for that first failure: bounded decision question, selected answer, and downstream action recoverability. Add source-use, receiving-locus, lexical, or architecture blockers only when that load is live.
3. If the `DRR` is only a small local editorial decision with no downstream pattern drafting or cross-pattern distribution, stop without minting `DRRDecisionAdequacyRead`; use `E.9` directly and run `E.10` only for live wording.
4. If one live hard blocker fails, return `repairBeforeDrafting` with one first repair locus and the downstream pattern-writing use that would fail. Do not open a full coordinate table merely to confirm the same defect.
5. Open the full `E.9.DA:4.7` work order only when multi-pattern distribution, stop closure, contested architecture selection, source and SoTA inheritance, sibling-decision coordination, or high-risk neighbour overread is live.

#### E.9.DA:4.7 - Work order for using the pattern

1. Name `DRRVersionRef`, `DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse`, `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap`, and `DRRReadQualificationWindow`.
2. Apply the activated `DRRDecisionAdequacyEligibilitySet` rows first.
3. If an eligibility row fails, repair the `DRR`, narrow the read, split the decision, or hold for architecture decision before coordinate comparison.
4. Select active coordinates from `E.9.DA:4.5`.
5. Check coordinate orthogonalization: each active coordinate must have a distinct failure mode, distinct repair question, or explicit subreading.
6. Assign each active coordinate an ordinal value using only `DRR` text and content evidence, not administrative state.
7. Repair active coordinates below the declared floor, narrow the use, or set a non-ready status.
8. Run `E.10` only over load-bearing new or repaired names, status values, coordinate heads, examples, stop conditions, and finding or result wording introduced or changed by the read. If wording is ordinary and no relation-like, epistemic, publication, source-transfer, naming, evidence, work, gate, or decision load remains, stop at local rewrite.
9. If the read claims `admissibleForDeclaredAuthoringUse`, state the first drafting move and the most expansive non-admissible overread.

Reopen the smallest live locus when later source use, accepted-decision inheritance, receiving-locus obligation, lexical closure, source-return condition, architecture decision, architecture description, publication split, or first drafting move changes enough to alter an active coordinate, an eligibility row, or `DRRDecisionAdequacyStatus`. Do not reopen the whole adequacy read only because review, landing, or chat state changed.

Before declaring a stop, ask what became worse while the visible coordinates improved: authoring cost, first-use cost, neighbour-pattern cost, source-loss risk, shadow-spec risk, repeated restoration doctrine, retrieval confusion, migration cost, durable-name fanout, and chance that pattern authors will still invent hidden decisions. If one of those losses can change admissible `DRR` use, express it through an active coordinate, a narrowed use, or a non-ready status rather than hiding it outside the read.

When the same `DRR` version is being improved through repeated passes, use `E.23` for the repeated quality-improvement method. `E.9.DA` supplies the `DRR` decision-adequacy coordinates, values, source-use mutation checks, receiving-locus obligations, status, and stop or repair meanings; it does not govern row-atomic absorption across passes, method-family selection, or stop, narrow, continue, switch method, or hold decisions.


Self-application is bounded. `E.9.DA` may be used to read a `DRR` about `E.9.DA`, but that read still evaluates the `DRR` decision-adequacy claim, not the pattern text. A pattern-quality read of the `E.9.DA` pattern text remains a separate `E.21` use. If `E.9.DA` self-application exposes a content defect, repair the pattern text or narrow the declared authoring use; if it exposes an architecture defect, use `holdForArchitectureDecision`.

#### E.9.DA:4.7a - Replayable adequacy read

A carrier, review packet, monolith position, chat, release note, or steward acceptance can locate material. It cannot change an `E.9.DA` read unless the `DRR` text, declared authoring use, receiving-locus disposition map, read qualification window, source-use stance, accepted-decision carry-through, or active content loci change.

#### E.9.DA:4.7b - Finding sentence grammar

A conforming `E.9.DA` finding has this grammar:

```text
E.9.DA finding:
  DRR version being evaluated: <DRRVersionRef>
  Declared authoring use: <DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse>
  Finding category: <eligibility blocker | coordinate reading | status payload | stop-condition failure | architecture-neighbour conflict | bounded non-use | neighbouring-pattern handoff>
  Exact E.9.DA locus: <EligibilitySet row | coordinate | status | stop clause | boundary row>
  Exact DRR loci: <DRRCoordinateLocusRefs>
  Effect: <status, coordinate, floor, or stop impact>
  First admissible repair or bounded non-use: <repair locus | narrowed use | split boundary | architecture hold | bounded non-use>
```

Vague labels such as `weak DRR`, `not ready`, `needs more evidence`, `architecture unclear`, `not enough SoTA`, or `review failed` are nonconforming until rewritten into this grammar.

#### E.9.DA:4.7c - Result capsule

A short `E.9.DA` result may be stated without a full report when the ordinary-cost first pass is enough.

```text
E.9.DA result:
  DRR: <DRRVersionRef>
  Declared authoring use: <DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse>
  Status: <DRRDecisionAdequacyStatus>
  First drafting move or first repair: <...>
   Most expansive non-admissible overread: <...>
  Reopen if: <smallest changed locus or condition>
```

This capsule is a local statement of the adequacy read. It is not a review record, gate result, release evidence, assurance, or pattern-quality status.

### E.9.DA:5 - Archetypal Grounding

**Tell.** A `DRR` is not good enough because it has headings. It is good enough for drafting when a pattern author can rely on its selected answer, receiving-locus obligations, boundaries, source-use posture, architecture choice, and examples without inventing a missing decision.

**Show, weak DRR.** A `DRR` about precision restoration says that `E.10`, `A.6.P`, and `C.2.P` are relevant, and notes that architecture terms may need repair. It does not decide whether there is a new architecture-structure branch, what name it has, which existing patterns lose repeated repair prose, or which regression cases test the split. `E.9.DA` returns `repairBeforeDrafting` because `SelectedAnswerDecisiveness`, `ReceivingLocusObligationClosure`, and `DraftingActionability` are below the floor.

**Show, adequate DRR.** The same `DRR` selects `C.30.P - Architecture-Structure Precision Restoration`, assigns `E.10` the shared recovery sequence, assigns branch ontology to `A.6.P`, `C.2.P`, `C.30.P`, and `C.16.P`, states which evaluation patterns are slimmed, rejects a separate `LanguagePrecisionRestoration` pattern, and gives regression cases. `E.9.DA` can return `admissibleForDeclaredAuthoringUse` for pattern-host drafting.

**Show, system-facing and episteme-facing paired grounding.** A system-facing `DRR` says that an architecture diagram, graph, or ADR-like note will guide a structure amendment. `E.9.DA` requires the `DRR` to state the architecture claim or structure claim, described or grounding object when live, structural view relation, preserved and lost structure, selected receiving loci, non-use boundary, and first drafting move. An episteme-facing `DRR` says that a source, seminar, review, standard, or SoTA article will shape a pattern. `E.9.DA` requires source posture, selected payload, rejected payload, non-use boundary, and receiving-locus disposition. In both cases, the description or source locates material; it is not itself the FPF decision.

**Show, SoTA-heavy DRR.** A `DRR` for a quantum-like modeling lens carries literature, seminar material, reviewer findings, and FPF neighbour decisions. It is not adequate merely because the sources are numerous. It becomes adequate when the selected answer states which mathematical-lens claims enter the new pattern, which claims remain non-use, which terms require `E.10`, `A.6.P`, or `C.2.P` repair, which evaluation patterns get concrete SoTA, examples, and conformance obligations, and why the selected pattern split is the right FPF content architecture. `SoTAAndEvidenceUseInDecision`, `SourceUseAndDecisionInheritanceCarryThrough`, `ReceivingLocusObligationClosure`, and `FPFContentArchitectureSelectionAdequacy` are active.

**Show, causal DRR.** A `DRR` for counterfactual realizability and causal use touches a new causal pattern plus evidence, assurance, benchmark, dispatch, and fairness neighbours. It is adequate only if it decides the causal-use vocabulary, the selected FPF content architecture, the receiving-locus obligations, the non-admissible overreads, and the exact status sets and value sets that downstream hosts may use. A clean external review of a smaller host subset does not by itself make the wider `DRR` adequate for a wider declared authoring use.

**Show, architecture-impact DRR.** A `DRR` for architecture precision restoration touches architecture and structure language, structural views, graphs, diagrams, dashboards, publication faces, and source plans. `FPFContentArchitectureSelectionAdequacy` and `ArchitectureSourceAndViewLossClosure` are active because the `DRR` must distinguish the architecture or structure claim from its description, state which structure kinds and views are live, state what view losses are admissible, and block the overread that a graph, diagram, dashboard, or ADR-like note is the architecture itself.

**Near-miss, small edit.** A `DRR` fixes one typo or one local Plain-register sentence with no semantic change and no downstream drafting obligation. `E.9.DA` should not force a full read. The admissible result is to use `E.9` lightweight form, run `E.10` on the changed wording when load-bearing wording is live, and avoid minting `DRRDecisionAdequacyRead`.

### E.9.DA:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern biases FPF toward decision explicitness before drafting. The bias is intentional: missing decisions are cheaper to repair in a `DRR` than after they have been dispersed into several pattern hosts.

The bias is bounded. `E.9.DA` must not turn every small wording cleanup into a heavy decision audit, must not require all possible coordinates when the declared authoring use is narrow, and must not treat administrative state as evidence of decision adequacy.

Lens posture:

- **Ontology:** exact governed object, evaluation pattern, and decision boundary are privileged over broad labels.
- **Epistemology:** source and review material matters only when it changes a decision, boundary, source-use posture, validation obligation, or reopen condition.
- **Pragmatics:** the first pattern-drafting move and non-admissible overread must be visible.
- **Aesthetics:** concise rationale is preferred after required decisions are recoverable.
- **Ethics:** broad readiness claims and vague rejection labels are blocked when downstream authors would be forced to invent hidden decisions or repair direction.

### E.9.DA:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Requirement | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `CC-E9DA-1 (Object and version plus authoring use named).` | A conforming read **SHALL** name `DRRVersionRef`, `DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse`, `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap`, and `DRRReadQualificationWindow`. | Prevents unscoped adequacy claims and address-only adequacy. |
| `CC-E9DA-2 (Eligibility first).` | A conforming read **SHALL** apply active eligibility rows before coordinate comparison. | Prevents averaging hard decision defects into weak coordinates. |
| `CC-E9DA-3 (No scalarization).` | A conforming read **SHALL NOT** average coordinate values or publish one decision-adequacy score. | Keeps ordinal coordinates from becoming fake measurement. |
| `CC-E9DA-4 (Content loci only).` | Coordinate values **SHALL** be justified from `DRR` text, exact source use, accepted-decision inheritance, and content loci, not from administrative state, reputation, popularity, adoption, review completion, landing, release, or absence of those signals. | Prevents review, placement, or uptake signals from replacing decision adequacy. |
| `CC-E9DA-5 (Default floor).` | A `DRR` claimed as ready for drafting, host amendment, or multi-locus distribution **SHALL** reach `4 wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` on every active coordinate or narrow the claim by value. | Makes the stop rule operational without applying it to ordinary-cost first pass or small local editorial DRRs. |
| `CC-E9DA-6 (Lexical closure).` | Load-bearing names, status values, coordinate heads, examples, stop conditions, and finding or result wording added or repaired by the read **SHALL** pass `E.10`; when trigger words are load-bearing, the exact evaluation pattern or non-use disposition is named. | Prevents one broad term from replacing another. |
| `CC-E9DA-7 (Neighbour authority).` | The read **SHALL** distinguish amended loci, governing neighbours, outside-decision items, intentionally unamended loci, and sibling decisions. | Prevents a `DRR` from stealing or weakening neighbouring pattern authority. |
| `CC-E9DA-8 (Drafting action).` | `admissibleForDeclaredAuthoringUse` **SHALL** name the first drafting move and most expansive non-admissible overread. | Keeps adequacy tied to real pattern-writing use. |
| `CC-E9DA-9 (Non-ready statuses carry payload).` | `admissibleForNarrowedAuthoringUse`, `repairBeforeDrafting`, `splitDecisionRequired`, and `holdForArchitectureDecision` **SHALL** state the exact narrowed scope, repair locus, split boundary, or architecture question. | Makes non-ready results actionable. |
| `CC-E9DA-10 (DRR vs pattern quality).` | A conforming read **SHALL NOT** use `E.21` pattern-quality coordinates as DRR decision-adequacy coordinates. If the evaluated object is a pattern version, use `E.21` instead of `E.9.DA`. | Preserves the kind boundary between DRR and pattern. |
| `CC-E9DA-11 (Scale normalization).` | Coordinate values **SHALL** follow the neutral ordinal scale and coordinate value evidence test; they **SHALL NOT** be averaged, percent-scored, maturity-ranked, or raised or lowered by administrative state. | Prevents pseudo-measurement and review-state proxies. |
| `CC-E9DA-12 (Coordinate orthogonalization).` | Active coordinates **SHALL** have distinct failure modes, distinct repair questions, or explicit subreadings; shared evidence **SHALL NOT** double-count one property as several adequate coordinates. | Prevents hidden weighting and coordinate overlap. |
| `CC-E9DA-13 (Architecture selection is read).` | When the `DRR` selects a new pattern, existing pattern, split, merge, governed object, branch, selected companion publication, receiving-locus disposition map, or selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair, the read **SHALL** activate `FPFContentArchitectureSelectionAdequacy`. | Prevents exact but wrong architecture decisions from passing as merely complete distribution. |
| `CC-E9DA-14 (Ordinary-cost first pass).` | A first-pass `E.9.DA` use **SHALL NOT** require a full coordinate-menu read, full `DRRCoordinateLocusRefs`, full `E.10` sweep, or all active-neighbour checks unless the declared `DRRDeclaredAuthoringUse` makes them live. | Prevents DRR adequacy apparatus from becoming the first action. |
| `CC-E9DA-14a (Repeated improvement locus).` | When a `DRR` decision-adequacy read becomes part of repeated improvement, the repeated method **SHALL** be governed by `E.23`; `E.9.DA` continues to supply decision-adequacy coordinates, source-use mutation checks, receiving-locus obligations, status, and stop or repair meanings. | Prevents `E.9.DA` from becoming the full improvement-loop method while keeping exceptional DRR improvement available. |

| `CC-E9DA-15 (Pattern-version boundary).` | If the evaluated object is an authored FPF pattern version, the read **SHALL** start in `E.21`; `E.9.DA` may be opened only for the upstream `DRR` decision-adequacy blocker that affects that pattern authoring use. | Preserves the boundary between DRR decision adequacy and pattern quality, and prevents pattern evaluation from becoming DRR bureaucracy. |
| `CC-E9DA-16 (SoTA mutation binding).` | A load-bearing source, standard, review, audit, benchmark, expert claim, or accepted decision **SHALL** change a selected answer, receiving-locus obligation, rejected alternative, non-use boundary, worked case, conformance item, validation obligation, architecture choice, stop condition, or reopen condition; otherwise it is rationale-only or lineage-only for the read. | Blocks decorative source lists and source theatre. |
| `CC-E9DA-17 (Currentness and lineage split).` | Current SoTA under E.8, living or refreshable source, lineage-only material, local accepted decision, rationale-only material, and rejected popular practice **SHALL** be distinguished when source currentness can change a coordinate or status. Official status, source recency, popularity, citation volume, adoption, awards, or familiar terminology do not make a source `currentSoTA` unless the DRR states why it carries the current best-known answer for the governed problem. | Prevents old lineage, fresh standards, or popular practice from masquerading as current decision material. |
| `CC-E9DA-18 (No certification by adequacy read).` | `E.9.DA` **SHALL NOT** be used as safety, security, compliance, assurance, gate, release, work, or project-world certification. | Keeps DRR decision adequacy from becoming false external authority. |
| `CC-E9DA-19 (Distributed receiving-locus traceability).` | A conforming multi-locus read **SHALL** use `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap` and classify content obligation, non-obligation, governing-neighbour relation, sibling decision, and first drafting implication for each live locus. | Prevents address completion without content disposition. |
| `CC-E9DA-20 (Architectural governing-neighbour boundary).` | If authoring, pattern quality, review, lexical repair, measurement, naming, evidence, assurance, gate, release, work, safety, security, compliance, architecture, publication, graph view, or source-use claims are live, the read **SHALL** name the exact evaluation pattern and the limited `E.9.DA` relation. | Prevents `E.9.DA` from becoming an orchestration hub or shadow authority. |
| `CC-E9DA-21 (Replayable adequacy read).` | A conforming read **SHALL** be replayable from `DRRVersionRef`, declared authoring use, qualification window, source-use stance, receiving-locus disposition map, and exact DRR loci; carrier, chat, landing, review, or release state alone **SHALL NOT** change the read. | Preserves content-based adequacy and repeatability. |
| `CC-E9DA-22 (No orchestration hub).` | `E.9.DA` **SHALL NOT** prescribe process execution, handoff sequence, work queue, review workflow, authoring pipeline, gate sequence, or release path. It may state candidate evaluation patterns, first repair locus, first drafting move, narrowed use, split boundary, or architecture hold as outputs. | Keeps declarative pattern application separate from process planning. |
| `CC-E9DA-23 (Finding grammar).` | An `E.9.DA` finding **SHALL** use the grammar in `E.9.DA:4.7b` or an equivalent explicit structure. | Prevents vague adequacy judgements from becoming reviewer authority. |
| `CC-E9DA-24 (No vague rejection).` | A non-ready `E.9.DA` result **SHALL NOT** stop at `weak DRR`, `not ready`, `needs more evidence`, `architecture unclear`, `not enough SoTA`, or `review failed`. It **SHALL** name the exact `DRR` locus, exact `E.9.DA` eligibility row or coordinate, status effect, and first admissible repair, narrowed use, split boundary, architecture hold, or bounded non-use. | Keeps authoring repairable and prevents opaque stewardship. |
| `CC-E9DA-25 (No reputation or adoption adequacy).` | A `DRR` adequacy read **SHALL NOT** raise or lower coordinate values from reviewer praise, reviewer acceptance, reviewer-clean packet status, number of reviews, steward acceptance, campaign progress, landing state, monolith placement, release inclusion, source volume, citation volume, popularity, adoption, awards, prior use, absence of use, or absence of review. A signal may affect a coordinate only after it is rewritten into replayable `DRR` decision-content evidence for the exact `DRRVersionRef`, declared authoring use, source set, receiving-locus disposition map, read qualification window, and coordinate. | Prevents administrative and reputation medals from replacing decision-content adequacy. |

### E.9.DA:8 - Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Failure | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| **Heading-complete DRR.** | The `DRR` has `Problem`, `Decision`, `Rationale`, and `Consequences`, but pattern authors still cannot tell what to write. | Apply eligibility rows and repair `SelectedAnswerDecisiveness` plus `DraftingActionability`. |
| **Source packet in DRR clothing.** | The `DRR` preserves source content but does not select FPF content. | Repair `BoundedDecisionQuestionRecoverability`, `SelectedAnswerDecisiveness`, `DRRSourceUseDischargeMap?`, and `SourceUseAndDecisionInheritanceCarryThrough`. |
| **Neighbour mention without obligation.** | A related pattern is named but not classified as amended, receives content obligation, governs only, outside current decision, sibling decision, or intentionally unamended. | Repair `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap` and `ReceivingLocusObligationClosure`. |
| **Explicit but wrong FPF content architecture.** | The `DRR` assigns every locus, but the split or merge, new-pattern choice, selected companion publication, selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair, or neighbour and local boundary is substantively wrong. | Repair `FPFContentArchitectureSelectionAdequacy`; if the governed object or receiving locus cannot be selected, set `holdForArchitectureDecision`. |
| **Watch item disguised as decision.** | The `DRR` says a question may be handled by drafting without selecting the answer now. | Select the answer, narrow the `DRR`, or set `splitDecisionRequired`. |
| **Lexical scorekeeping.** | The read counts trigger words but does not repair their load-bearing meaning. | Apply `E.10` closure and exact receiving-pattern recovery. |
| **Pattern-quality substitution.** | The `DRR` is judged by whether the resulting pattern text would be usable. | Judge the `DRR` decision-adequacy claim; evaluate the resulting pattern version by `E.21`. |
| **Review-state proxy.** | A `DRR` is marked adequate because a reviewer accepted it, or inadequate because it has not been reviewed. | Use content loci for coordinates; keep review state in `DRRReadQualificationWindow` or review records. |
| **Reputation medal adequacy.** | A `DRR` is marked more adequate because many sources are cited, a steward praised it, a reviewer-clean packet exists, or many downstream users rely on it; or marked less adequate because it is new and not yet used. | Rewrite the signal into exact `DRR` decision-content evidence or keep it outside the coordinate value. Adequacy changes only when selected answers, receiving-locus obligations, source-use posture, architecture choice, validation obligations, non-use boundaries, stop conditions, or reopen conditions change or are shown weak. |
| **Workstream plan as doctrine.** | A source plan, queue, campaign source, or review packet is treated as landed FPF authority. | Add `DRRSourceUseDischargeMap?`; state source posture and selected payload by value in the `DRR`. |
| **ADR-as-decision.** | An ADR-like publication, review packet, or note is treated as the project-side decision or as an FPF `DRR`. | Split decision, decision description, publication form, and FPF `DRR`; move project-side decision claims to exact neighbouring patterns. |
| **Graph-as-architecture.** | A TGA graph, generated relation graph, clustering result, LCA view, diagram, or dashboard is treated as architecture itself. | Name the architecture claim or structure claim, view and description relation, preserved and lost structure, source-return condition, and non-use boundary. |
| **Review packet as evidence.** | A review packet or returned finding is treated as project evidence, assurance, gate, release, or compliance proof. | Keep review material as source-use or accepted-decision material for the `DRR`; move project evidence, assurance, or gate claims to exact evaluation patterns. |
| **Companion note as Core.** | A companion architecture note, source packet, or companion document is treated as if it already changed FPF Core pattern text. | State the selected receiving loci and first drafting implications; keep companion-publication authority bounded until landed pattern text or selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference content carries the decision. |

### E.9.DA:9 - Consequences

| Consequence | Benefit | Cost or guard |
|---|---|---|
| DRR adequacy becomes inspectable before drafting. | Pattern authors get decisions instead of source summaries. | Ordinary first pass states only the declared authoring use, the first failing drafting decision, and the first repair locus; active coordinates are required only when the full adequacy read is live. |
| Weak DRRs fail before fanout into several hosts. | Later pattern repair is cheaper. | Very small editorial decisions should use `E.9` directly, not a full read. |
| `E.21` remains about pattern quality. | No false kind inheritance from pattern text to `DRR` text. | Users must learn a neighbouring pattern name, `E.9.DA`, only when an upstream DRR blocker is live. |
| Lexical closure is applied after adequacy repair. | New status names and coordinate labels do not become umbrellas. | `E.10` is applied only to load-bearing new or repaired names, status values, coordinates, examples, stop conditions, and findings or result wording. |
| The stop rule becomes explicit. | Authors can stop improving a `DRR` without pretending it is perfect. | Active coordinates below the declared floor require repair, narrowing, split, or hold. |
| Reopen scope is local. | Later discoveries repair the changed coordinate, eligibility row, source-use posture, receiving-locus disposition, or status payload first. | Whole-read reopening is reserved for changes that can alter the declared authoring use or status. |
| Architecture adequacy is explicit. | A `DRR` can no longer pass only because every content fragment has an address. | Authors must justify selected split, merge, new-pattern, and existing-pattern choices, and architecture description, view, and source-return boundaries by value when those choices are live. |
| Source mutation is explicit. | SoTA, standards, reviews, audits, benchmarks, and expert claims shape decisions rather than decorate them. | Sources that do not mutate selected payload remain rationale-only or lineage-only for this read. |
| Corpus ecology is protected. | Duplicate trigger lists, shadow specs, repeated restoration doctrine, and durable-name fanout become visible before landing. | The read must name the smallest receiving locus or exact neighbouring pattern rather than adding local variants everywhere. |

### E.9.DA:10 - Rationale

`E.9.DA` is placed beside `E.9` because the governed object is a decision-rationale record, not an authored pattern body. The pattern reuses the neutral ordinal scale and no-scalarization discipline of `E.21`, but it does not make a `DRR` a pattern-quality object under evaluation.

The selected name uses `DA` for decision adequacy. It avoids `.Q` because `Q` is already loaded by quality-term restoration and Q-Bundle practice. This prevents a naming collision between "quality" as a subject-domain term and "adequacy read" as an evaluation posture.

The default floor of `4 wellExpressedForDeclaredUse` matches the shared pattern-quality readiness floor only when the `DRR` is claimed as ready for drafting, host amendment, or multi-locus distribution. The coordinates differ because the object differs. A pattern must be action-guiding for users; a `DRR` must be decision-bearing for downstream authors.

### E.9.DA:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Claim | Practice posture | Source family | Local adoption | Non-use boundary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DRR adequacy is decision-content adequacy, not template completeness. | Current-standard/reference-only for architecture descriptions: joint ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 is useful for concern, viewpoint, architecture description, and rationale inspectability, but it is not sufficient FPF adequacy by itself. | `E.9` adoption of architecture-description standards such as joint ISO, IEC, and IEEE 42010:2022. | `E.9.DA` reads whether concerns, alternatives, selected answers, and consequences are recoverable enough for the declared authoring use. | A diagram, view, architecture note, or edited text is not adequate merely because it exists. |
| Multi-host FPF changes need receiving-locus decision adequacy, not only a central record. | Lineage/current-practice source-use material: ADR practice gives useful context, decision, and consequence records; FPF multi-locus drafting needs exact receiving-locus disposition. | `E.9` adoption of Markdown ADR practice, including post-2015 lightweight ADR and MADR-style templates. | `DRRReceivingLocusDispositionMap`, `ReceivingLocusObligationClosure`, and `DraftingActionability` specialize ADR-style records for FPF content distribution. | A generic ADR template is not sufficient when a multi-pattern FPF change needs by-value receiving obligations. |
| Architecture-description sources can be lineage or current source-use material, but not sufficient adequacy by themselves. | Living/refreshable source-use material: continuous and evolutionary architecture decision-record practice treats decision records as revisitable. | `E.9` adoption of continuous and evolutionary architecture decision-record practice. | `DRRReadQualificationWindow`, `DRRSourceUseDischargeMap?`, and smallest-live-locus reopen state what can change the read. | Review, landing, release, monolith, or chat state does not raise or lower coordinates by itself. |
| SoTA evidence must mutate the decision. | Inherited-current FPF neighbour posture plus living-review analogy: current FPF `E.8`, `E.19`, and `E.21` already require currentness and non-decorative SoTA; living-guideline style currentness is adapted only for source-refresh discipline. | Current FPF `E.8`, `E.19`, `E.21`, and living-guideline style currentness discipline. | `SoTAAndEvidenceUseInDecision` and `E.9.DA:4.4c` require each load-bearing source to change selected answer, obligation, boundary, case, validation, architecture choice, stop, or reopen condition. | A citation shelf is rationale-only or lineage-only when it changes no DRR payload. |
| SoTA is refreshable and currentness-labeled. | Living/refreshable source-use posture, not systematic-review workflow: updateable source material must be separated from ordinary background and lineage. | Current FPF currentness, source-use, and refresh posture in `E.19`, `E.21`, and `E.9`. | `DRRReadQualificationWindow`, source posture, and reopen condition state when source-use can change a coordinate or status. | This does not import systematic-review workflow as mandatory apparatus for ordinary `DRR`s. |
### E.9.DA:12 - Relations

| Pattern | Relation |
|---|---|
| `E.9` | Governs the `DRR` kind and minimum decision-rationale record form. `E.9.DA` reads whether one `DRR` version is adequate for a declared downstream authoring use; it is not a second DRR form or mandatory ordinary editorial step. |
| `E.8` | Governs authored FPF pattern bodies that may be drafted after an accepted `DRR`. `E.9.DA` applies only when the authored pattern body is drafted from a `DRR` and the blocker is whether the `DRR` selected, distributed, carried source use, and supplied an actionable decision sufficiently for that authoring use. |
| `E.21` | Governs pattern-quality reads for one FPF pattern version. `E.9.DA` may be opened only when a pattern-quality defect traces to a missing, vague, unassigned, source-theatre, or architecture-by-addressing upstream `DRR` decision; it does not become a pattern-quality coordinate. |
| `E.22` | Governs improvement-oriented quality-read question framing. `E.9.DA` may use `QualityReadQuestionFrame` to distinguish floor adequacy, exceptional DRR improvement, Pareto trade-off inspection, open-question discovery, or absorption impact before the decision-adequacy read result is formed. |
| `E.23` | Governs repeated quality-improvement loops. `E.9.DA` supplies the decision-adequacy object-under-improvement evaluation for one `DRR` version inside such a loop; `E.23` governs repeated absorption, re-read, method-family selection, and stop, narrow, continue, switch method, or hold decisions. |

| `E.19` | Governs pattern admission and refresh reviews. An `E.19` finding may expose that an upstream `DRR` did not decide enough; `E.9.DA` then reads that `DRR`, while `E.19` keeps the pattern-review finding. |
| `E.10` | Governs lexical trigger scan and closure for load-bearing names, coordinates, status values, examples, stop conditions, and finding or result wording introduced or repaired by the read. |
| `A.6.P` and `C.2.P` | Receive relation-like, episteme, publication, or source-transfer precision restoration when `E.10` selects those readings. |
| `F.18` | Governs durable naming when a local `E.9.DA` name is promoted beyond this pattern-local read. |
| `C.16`, `A.17`, `A.18`, `A.19`, `C.25` | Govern measurement, Characteristic and Scale discipline, characteristic spaces, and Q-Bundle normal form when the adequacy read becomes a measurement or quality-family claim. |
| `C.16.P` | Receives characteristic-scale precision restoration when words such as coordinate, score, quality, strong, axis, dimension, or metric hide the live characteristic and scale construction. |
| Architecture-facing FPF patterns | When a `DRR` affects architecture-facing FPF content, `E.9.DA` reads whether source-use posture, affected structures, structure kinds, architecture structural views, view losses, source-return conditions, splits among architecture decision, architecture description, and publication, and graph, view, or ADR non-use boundaries are decision-bearing enough for drafting. It does not run an architecture workstream, select campaign order, or make architecture descriptions into evidence, gates, assurance, release, or project decisions. |
