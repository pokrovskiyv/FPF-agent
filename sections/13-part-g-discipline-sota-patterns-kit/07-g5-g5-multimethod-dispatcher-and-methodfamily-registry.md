## G.5 - Multi‑Method Dispatcher and MethodFamily Registry

> **Type:** General (G)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

**Plain-name.** Multi-method dispatcher and method-family registry.

**Intent.** Govern the dispatcher and registry object set for rival method families and publish selector-facing retained-set outcomes without collapsing plurality into one hidden scalar winner.

### G.5:0 - Use this when
When loop-engineering work retains several loop candidates, harness variants, method families, workflow-store entries, or DPF framework candidates for downstream use, use `G.5` only when the live claim is selector-facing publication of that retained set. The published result states the outcome kind, retained members, ordering status if any, and basis pins. It does not prove that any member improved, that work occurred, or that a local choice has been made.

- several method families or generator families can admissibly act on the same declared task family or work target
- you need one selector to return a `Shortlist`, `RankedShortlist`, one `SpecialistHandoff`, one other narrowed handoff plan, or one abstain outcome without pretending that there is always one scalar winner
- the published result must carry enough basis pins for later comparison, handoff, or escalation without changing its declared outcome kind or any applicable public selected-set label

### G.5:0.1 - What goes wrong if missed

- rival families are compared under silent comparator drift, hidden baseline changes, or unspoken crossing costs
- the selector hides one dogmatic winner even when only a partial order is admissible
- selected-set publication gets hidden inside `C.11`, `C.19`, or `C.24`, so the published result no longer makes clear whether it carries local choice, pool policy, enactment, or publication
- exploration, open-ended, or specialization pressure leaks in as one architecture convenience rather than one explicit policy-bound choice

### G.5:0.2 - What this buys

- one registry that keeps rival method families disjoint but dispatchable
- one selector result form that can publish candidate sets, `Shortlist`, `RankedShortlist`, one `SpecialistHandoff`, narrowed handoff plans, or abstain outcomes honestly
- one trace addressable by DRR and SCR records with explicit basis pins instead of one hidden selector rationale
- one explicit publication closure so the declared outcome kind, any applicable public selected-set label, retained members or handoff content, ordering status, and basis pins are stated directly in the emitted result

Registry and dispatch remain the primary selector question here; selected-set publication is the explicit closure record for that selector question, not a replacement for it.

### G.5:0.3 - First-minute questions

- What selector outcome kind is this result actually emitting: one set-result outcome such as `Shortlist` or `RankedShortlist`, one `SpecialistHandoff` or other narrowed handoff, or one abstain outcome?
- Which members are being retained or excluded now?
- Does order materially belong to the published result?
- Which basis pins or policy pins must the published result carry?

### G.5:0.4 - First output

The first useful output from this dispatcher and registry question is one published selector outcome: one set-result outcome such as `Shortlist` or `RankedShortlist`, one `SpecialistHandoff` or other narrowed handoff plan, or one abstain or escalation result, with the outcome kind, any public selected-set label, retained members or handoff content, ordering status when relevant, and basis pins stated in one place.

If that first output still cannot be written honestly, the current publication result is not finished `G.5` publication yet.

G.5 keeps the dispatcher and registry object set here and leaves universal Part-G invariants to `G.Core`; method-specific and generator-specific semantics stay in their named source patterns and arrive here only through explicit pins.

When `C.11` has already emitted one local choice result, `C.19` one pool-policy result, or `C.24` one enactment-facing next action, `G.5` begins where the question becomes selector-facing publication of the retained set or narrowed handoff result rather than one more explanation of why the result looked reasonable. A conformant `G.5` pass should therefore publish the retained set, narrowed handoff, or abstain result directly, with its declared outcome kind, any applicable public selected-set label, and basis pins explicit in the result itself.

A publication result remains unfinished if the declared outcome kind, any applicable public selected-set label, retained members or handoff content, ordering status, abstain or escalation condition, or basis pins are still only implicit in upstream notes.

When a framework publishes a selected pattern set, use `G.5` only for the selected-set publication claim: scope, selection conditions, included pattern refs, excluded candidate refs when relevant, publication status, and basis pins. This selected-set claim does not define pattern-use relations, architecture decisions, or framework edition dependencies.

### G.5:1 - Problem frame

A `CG‑FrameContext` (from **G.1**) and a `SoTA Synthesis Pack@CG‑Frame` (from **G.2**) expose multiple rival, internally coherent **method families** (and sometimes **generator families**) that can plausibly act on the same `EntityOfConcernRef` and ReferencePlane.

At the same time, the typed slot, scale, and coordinate definitions from **G.3** and **G.4** yield admissible calculi and acceptance clauses - enough to formulate *eligibility*, *assurance*, and *admissibility* constraints, but not enough to pick "the method" without collapsing plurality.

You need a **notation‑independent** way to:

1. register method families and generator families as *auditable, versioned* entries,
2. select, compose, or fall back among them at run time for a concrete task instance,
3. publish stable selected-set results and stable identities to UTS, and
4. emit RSCR‑relevant triggers and pins without inventing new “shadow specs”.

### G.5:2 - Problem

How to design a **general, auditable dispatcher** that:

* preserves **pluralism** (families from competing Traditions stay disjoint) while remaining **dispatchable** (selection is possible and explainable);
* does **not embed algorithmic dogma** in the core selector kernel;
* respects Context boundaries and crossing discipline (Bridge‑only; explicit pins);
* produces **set‑valued outcomes** when only partial orders are admissible;
* cleanly separates:

  * **selector object set and components** (registry, selector boundary, and publication records),
  * **universal Part‑G invariants** (carried by `G.Core`),
  * **method-specific and generator-specific semantics** (carried only through `Extensions` blocks).

### G.5:3 - Forces

* **Pluralism vs. forced totalisation.** Many selection regimes are inherently partial-order; forcing a scalar winner often creates inadmissible semantics.
* **Evidence realism vs. hard gates.** Eligibility and acceptance frequently depend on incomplete evidence; selection must remain auditable under tri-state unknowns.
* **Reuse vs. leakage.** Cross‑Context reuse is valuable but must be explicit (Bridge with loss notes) and must not silently re‑ground semantics.
* **Exploration vs. exploitation.** Dispatch sometimes must probe alternatives under explicit policy envelopes and risk envelopes, but probing must not become an implicit fourth status.
* **Evolvability vs. churn.** Registries evolve (new families, deprecations, edition bumps); continuity must not be broken by “rename by meaning”.

### G.5:4 - Solution
#### G.5:4.6a - Causal method dispatch declarations

Method selection involving causal methods must declare whether a compared method is an observational predictor, an intervention optimizer, a counterfactual strategy, a causal fairness estimator, a causal-RL policy, or a simulation-only method.

Optional `MethodFamily.causalUseDispatchSpec?`:

```text
MethodFamily.causalUseDispatchSpec? {
  causalUseQuestionRef?: CausalUseQuestionRef
  targetCausalityLadderRung: CausalityLadderRung
  causalUseClaimKind: CausalUseClaimKind
  causalActionPolicyClass?: CausalActionPolicyClass
  causalEvidenceSupportBasis?: CausalEvidenceSupportBasis
  causalUseSupportRecordRef?: CausalUseSupportRecordRef
  causalUseSupportVerdict?: CausalUseSupportVerdict
  causalMethodUseClassification:
    observationalPredictor |
    interventionOptimizer |
    counterfactualStrategy |
    causalFairnessEstimator |
    causalRLPolicy |
    simulationOnlyMethod
  supportedUse: CausalUseSupportStatement
  unsupportedUse: CausalUseUnsupportedStatement
}
```

`CausalUseQuestionRef` is a local reference to the causal-use question governed by the causal, evidence, intervention, or simulation pattern current for the case. It is not admitted here as a durable root U-kind.

`causalMethodUseClassification` is a selector-facing method-use classification, not a `U.Role`, role assignment, responsibility, or actor position. `simulationOnlyMethod` maps to `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis = simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis`, bounded simulation-supported use, and unsupported intervention-effect or realized-counterfactual-sample use unless another `C.28` support basis is cited.

What changes in practice: a selector must not compare "methods that improve outcome" unless each causal method declares the causality-ladder rung, causal method-use classification, and `C.28` support record and verdict when causal-use support is being consumed.

What this does not authorize: `G.5` does not identify causal effects, decide fairness, certify off-policy causal evaluation, or compare cross-rung causal methods as one undifferentiated improvement set; it keeps method dispatch and selected-set publication while `C.28` governs causal-use support.

#### G.5:4.1 - G.Core linkage (normative)

**Builds on:** `G.Core` (Part‑G core invariants; Default Governing Definition Index citation)

**GCoreLinkageManifest (normative; size-controlled via profiles and sets).**
Effective obligations, pins, and triggers are computed by union expansion of the referenced ids (per `G.Core:4.2.1`). Profile and set expansion is combined with explicit deltas; `Nil‑elision` applies.

* `CoreConformanceProfileIds :=`

  * `GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.AuthoringBase`
  * `GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.TriStateGuard`
  * `GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.UTSWhenPublicIdsMinted`
  * `GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.ShippingBoundary`
* `CorePinSetIds :=`

  * `GCorePinSetId.PartG.AuthoringMinimal`
  * `GCorePinSetId.PartG.CrossingVisibilityPins` *(crossing‑aware use; pins from this set may be intentionally strengthened (optional→required) via `CorePinsRequired`)*
* `CorePinsRequired :=` *(delta over PinSets; pins and refs are id-only; prefer strengthening optional-to-required over restating pins already covered by PinSets)*

  * `TaskSignatureRef` *(see `G.5:4.2`, S2)*
  * `MethodFamilyId[]` *(registry keys in scope)*
  * `GeneratorFamilyId[]?` *(when generator families are in scope)*
  * `PathId[]` *(audit citations for “why” and for evidence)*
  * `PathSliceId[]` *(audit citations for “why” and for evidence)*
  * `UTSRowId[]` *(published identities for selected families, registered families, and selector policy records)*
  * `FailureBehaviorPolicyId?` *(only when degrade or abstain behavior is explicitly policy‑bound)*
  * `SoSLogBranchId?` *(only when degrade or abstain behavior is explicitly policy‑bound)*
* `DefaultsConsumed :=`

  * `DefaultId.GammaFoldForR_eff`
  * `DefaultId.PortfolioMode`
  * `DefaultId.DominanceRegime`
* `RSCRTriggerSetIds :=`

  * `GCoreTriggerSetId.RefreshOrchestration`
    *(payload pins: `TaskSignatureRef`, `CGSpecRef.edition`, `CNSpecRef.edition`, `MethodFamilyId[]`, `GeneratorFamilyId[]?`, `AcceptanceClauseId[]?`, `SoSLogBranchId?`, `FailureBehaviorPolicyId?`, `DescriptorMapRef.edition?`, `DistanceDefRef.edition?`, `TransferRulesRef.edition?`, `InsertionPolicyRef?`, `PathId`, `PathSliceId`, `SCRId`, `DRRId`, `RSCRTestId[]`)*

#### G.5:4.2 - Dispatcher and Registry object set (notation‑independent)

G.5 defines the **object-set components** below. Their purpose is to make dispatch **possible and auditable** without embedding any method-family semantics in the selector kernel.

**S1 — `MethodFamily Registry` (design‑time; per CG‑Frame).**
A registry row represents *a family*, not a single implementation. Minimal fields (conceptual, notationally independent):

* `Identity`: `MethodFamilyId`, `ContextId`, lineage and Tradition notes, `UTSRowId` (twin labels where applicable).
* `EligibilityStandardRef`: a typed predicate record (tri‑state per `G.Core`), expressed in CHR and CAL terms and pinned to the relevant editions.
* `AssuranceProfileRef`: evidence‑lane expectations and assurance-lane pins (SCR‑addressable).
* `AdmissibilityBindings`: explicit references to the **single** governance card and admissibility gate (`CNSpecRef`, `CGSpecRef`) and to any required admissibility constraints, for example scale and unit admissibility via CSLC.
* `EvidencePins`: citations to `G.6` (`PathId`, `PathSliceId`) for claims or guarantees where such claims are asserted.
* `CrossingAllowance`: explicit Bridge and CL allowance pins **only** if cross‑Context operation is claimed.
* `PolicyHooksRef?`: optional pointers to policy records (not defined here; wired via Extensions).

**S1′ — `GeneratorFamily Registry` (design‑time; optional; per CG‑Frame).**
A registry row for families that generate tasks and environments, and may co-evolve solver families. G.5 carries the registry-entry shape, not the generator semantics:

* `Identity`: `GeneratorFamilyId`, `ContextId`, `UTSRowId`.
* `GeneratorSignatureRef`: conceptual input and output semantics plus budget semantics.
* `EnvironmentValidityRegionRef?`: pinned constraints for generated environments or tasks.
* `TransferRulesRef.edition?`: required when the Open-Ended mode is enabled (semantics come from the cited extension refs).
* `CouplerRefs?`: which `MethodFamilyId[]` can be coupled with this generator family.

**S2 — `TaskSignature` record (design‑time and run‑time).**
A minimal typed record the dispatcher consumes. Its function is **pinning and auditability**, not over-specification. It must be CHR and CAL typed and provenance-aware.
G.5 treats `TaskSignatureRef` as an input record; it does not define CHR or CAL semantics.

**S3 — `Selection kernel boundary` (run‑time; policy‑governed).**
A notation‑independent selector that:

* consumes `TaskSignatureRef`, registry entries, and pinned spec refs,
* applies eligibility and assurance gating (tri-state),
* computes an admissible (possibly partial) order,
* returns one declared selector outcome: most often one set-result outcome such as `Shortlist` or `RankedShortlist`, but sometimes one `SpecialistHandoff`, one other narrowed handoff, one abstain outcome, or one escalation outcome (per `DefaultId.PortfolioMode` and explicit overrides),
* emits audit records with pins addressable by DRR and SCR records.

**S3.A — `TaskFamilySpecializationProfile@Context` (run‑time; conditional).**
When the real selector question is acquisition of usable specialization on a declared task family, the selector may publish one `TaskFamilySpecializationProfile@Context` for each candidate, one `SpecialistHandoff`, or one narrowed handoff plan. Here `profile` means one selector-time comparison record for bounded specialization, not a new U-kind and not a generic narrative profile. `G.5` carries this selector-time specialization question here; it does not re-govern the adaptation-signature field vocabulary from `C.22.1`.

The profile should therefore cite one `AdaptationSignatureRef` or equivalent pinned field set carrying the declared `TaskFamilyRef` or `TaskSignature`, the work-measure threshold target, prior exposure declaration, time-to-threshold, budget-to-threshold, post-threshold efficiency when relevant, any declared transfer or retention claim, any downside cost or downside on adjacent tasks, and any specialization-entry baseline, specialization-entry evidence, or stepping-stone evidence item that materially affects comparison.

Admission rule for `SpecialistHandoff`: use that handoff kind only when the truthful published result is one heterogeneous handoff bundle whose members occupy different specialization positions that still need to travel together. Do not use it when one ordinary `Shortlist`, `RankedShortlist`, `ExplorationArchive`, or another narrower named result kind already states the result more precisely.

When the declared task family is heterogeneous, the selector may return one `SpecialistHandoff`, one other narrowed handoff plan, or one small admissible set that preserves rival specialists rather than collapsing them into a fake single winner. Low-human-overlap candidates remain admissible only when the profile, evidence basis, and policy constraints are explicit.

**S4 — `Composition and fallbacks` templates (design‑time).**
A library of composition shapes (preconditioner -> solver -> verifier; cascades; meta-selectors) **as templates**, admissibility-checked and pinned. Concrete strategy semantics stay in the referenced method families; G.5 only carries the composition template, selector relation, registry row, or selected-set result. When the current object is the method-side relation itself, use `MethodRelationStructure@BoundedContext` under `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.15`, or the direct method-composition pattern; a G.5 registry row or selector outcome is not that structure by default. Algebraic, graph, matrix, embedding, or neural selector notation is a mathematical or representation lens when that representation is current.

**S5 — `Publication and telemetry` record boundary (run-time).**
A standard publication boundary publishes:

* `DRR` (decision rationale) and `SCR` (evidence and confidence citation) with explicit pins,
* declared selector and selected-set records,
* telemetry pins to refresh orchestration (`G.11`), without governing orchestration.

When the current publication question is selected-set publication rather than one generic registry trace, `Shortlist` is the public selected-set label, `RankedShortlist` is the ordered specialization when order materially belongs to the published result, `ShortlistId` is the emitted public identity, and `ChoiceSet` stays one mathematical gloss rather than the public selected-set label.

**S6 — `Governance and evolution` declaration boundary (design-time).**
Versioning, deprecation, and registry evolution discipline (UTS publication; continuity), without minting new Part‑G‑wide types.

#### G.5:4.3 - Selector head and narrower selector families

Selection and dispatch stay one generic selector head. Narrower selector families may refine it, but they do not redefine the universal invariants pinned through `G.Core`, do not add hidden mandatory inputs beyond pinned policy or edition refs, and do not mutate SlotKinds.

Method- and generator-specific pressures such as `QD` archives, open-ended declared sets, explore and exploit lenses, or preference comparators do not become part of the selector head. They arrive only through explicit extension declarations and the pins those extensions require.

#### G.5:4.4 - Selector Relation Fields

#### G.5:4.4a - Worked selector slice

- A catalyst-search team is choosing among three method families for the same declared `TaskSignature` and `C.22.1` adaptation signature.
- The shared profile pins one work-measure threshold target, one freshness window, one prior-exposure declaration, and one adaptation budget. One family reaches threshold quickly but carries high downside on adjacent tasks. One family is slower but transfers cleanly. One family never clears `MinimalEvidence` and must abstain.
- An admissible `G.5` result therefore publishes a set-return shortlist or a narrowed handoff plan, with DRR and SCR records citing why the third family was excluded and why the first two remain non-dominated. The selector does not invent one scalar winner and does not hide the specialization profile in auxiliary side notes.
- When one upstream `C.19` pass has already narrowed the live pool to one internal retained subset over registered families, `G.5` may publish that result as one `Shortlist` with one `ShortlistId` and explicit basis pins only when selector-facing publication is now the question. Until that emission occurs, the internal retained subset is not yet one public shortlist result.
- When one upstream `C.11` pass has already fixed one local choice over one declared source set, or one `C.24` pass has already produced one enactment-facing narrowed handoff, `G.5` may publish the selected-set or narrowed-handoff result only when selector-facing publication is now the question. Until this `G.5` emission occurs, the `ChoiceResult`, `CallPlan`, or `CheckpointReturn` is not itself one public `Shortlist`, `RankedShortlist`, or `ShortlistId`-bearing result.

#### G.5:4.4b - Published selected-set result and closure rule

A finished `G.5` pass should publish one explicit selected-set result from the dispatcher and registry question rather than one selector trace that leaves the public result implicit.

Publication here is the closure record for selector work over registered families. It does not replace registry maintenance, dispatcher comparison rules, or the upstream pool-policy and local-choice pattern authorities that supplied the retained members.

The admissible selector outcome families here are:

- `SelectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome`, with `SetResultFamily = Shortlist` when one retained set is published without one material internal order and `SetResultFamily = RankedShortlist` when ordering materially belongs to the result;
- `SelectorOutcomeKind = HandoffOutcome`, with `HandoffKind = SpecialistHandoff` or one other narrowed handoff plan when heterogeneity is the truthful downstream result;
- `SelectorOutcomeKind = AbstainOutcome` when no admissible candidate exists and the truthful result is one abstain;
- `SelectorOutcomeKind = EscalationOutcome` when no admissible candidate exists and the truthful result is one escalation.

`SetResultFamily` belongs only inside `SetResultOutcome`. `Shortlist` and `RankedShortlist` are public selector results over registered rows. They are not merely one upstream internal retained subset copied forward under one prettier label. `G.5` is the governing pattern that turns selector state into one public result with one explicit outcome kind, one explicit selected-set label when applicable, one explicit member set or handoff content, and one explicit basis-pin set.

A publication result should state at least these fields:

- the selector outcome kind being emitted;
- the public selected-set label when the outcome is one set-result outcome;
- retained members, or the narrowed handoff content, or the abstain or escalation condition;
- ordering status when ordering matters;
- basis pins and policy pins sufficient to justify the result;
- one explicit next downstream use boundary when the result is a handoff rather than one terminal publication.

A compact result may therefore look like:

```text
SelectorOutcome(
  selectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome,
  setResultFamily = Shortlist,
  members = [family_A, family_C],
  shortlistId = shortlist_17,
  ordering = unordered,
  basisPins = [pathSlice_41, scr_22],
  nextUse = downstream_comparison
)
```

or:

```text
SelectorOutcome(
  selectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome,
  setResultFamily = RankedShortlist,
  members = [family_B, family_A],
  shortlistId = shortlist_23,
  ordering = ranked,
  basisPins = [pathSlice_77, scr_44],
  nextUse = specialist_handoff
)
```

Close as `SelectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome` with `SetResultFamily = Shortlist` when several retained members survive admissibly but no public internal order belongs to the result. Close as `SelectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome` with `SetResultFamily = RankedShortlist` when order materially belongs to the published result. Close as `SelectorOutcomeKind = HandoffOutcome` with `HandoffKind = SpecialistHandoff` or one other narrowed handoff when heterogeneity itself is the truthful downstream result. Close as `SelectorOutcomeKind = AbstainOutcome` or `EscalationOutcome` when no admissible candidate exists under the pinned constraints.

If the publication still does not state what public result was emitted, who remained in it, whether order belongs to it, and which pins justify it, then the selector has not yet published one finished `G.5` result.

#### G.5:4.4bb - Public labels over archive, front, and style source sets

When a selector-facing publication uses labels such as `Shortlist`, `RankedShortlist`, declared `ExplorationArchive`, `Archive`, `Front`, `Q-front`, `SpecialistHandoff`, `StyleShortlist`, `TraditionShortlist`, abstain, or escalation, the G.5 question is the public selector outcome being emitted.

```text
SelectedSetPublicationLabelLine@Context:
  selectorOutcomeKind:
  setResultFamily?:
  sourceSetFamily:
  publicSelectedSetLabel?:
  derivedViewKind?:
  basePaletteOrArchiveRef?:
  membersOrHandoff:
  ordering:
  basisPins:
  nextUse:
```

`sourceSetFamily` may name a declared `Front`, `Q-front`, `ExplorationArchive`, `Archive`, current pool subset, or derived tradition view. `publicSelectedSetLabel` names the emitted selected-set label, normally `Shortlist` or `RankedShortlist`, and may use a domain label such as `StyleShortlist` or `TraditionShortlist` only when the term bridge is already clear. G.5 does not create the archive, compute the comparison, govern the pool policy, decide the cultural-evolution case, or repair the term bridge. Use `C.18`, `A.19.CPM`, `C.19`, `C.36`, `F.17`, `F.18`, and `F.9` for those relations.

#### G.5:4.4c - Publication quick card



The smallest useful `G.5` publication card usually states:

- `selectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome | HandoffOutcome | AbstainOutcome | EscalationOutcome`
- `setResultFamily = Shortlist | RankedShortlist` when `selectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome`
- `handoffKind = SpecialistHandoff | NarrowedHandoff` when `selectorOutcomeKind = HandoffOutcome`
- `membersOrHandoff = ...`
- `ordering = ranked | unordered | not applicable`
- `publicId = ...` when one public identity is emitted
- `basisPins = ...`
- `nextUse = downstream comparison | specialist handoff | escalation | none`

A short conforming card may therefore read:

```text
selectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome
setResultFamily = Shortlist
members = [family_A, family_C]
ordering = unordered
shortlistId = shortlist_17
basisPins = [pathSlice_41, scr_22]
nextUse = downstream_comparison
```

If the card does not already state what was published, who survived, whether order belongs to the result, and which pins justify it, the publication is still unfinished `G.5` work.

#### G.5:4.4ca - Derived tradition-view publication stays derived over one declared palette

- If selector work consumes one declared source set such as `Front`, `Archive`, or one source-set composition through one derived tradition view such as `TraditionFront` or `TraditionArchive`, treat that derived view as one interpretation view over one declared `SoTAPaletteDescription`, not as the default meaning of `Tradition` or of the palette itself.
- When `SelectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome`, the public selected-set label still closes as `Shortlist` or `RankedShortlist`; when `SelectorOutcomeKind = HandoffOutcome`, the result closes as one `SpecialistHandoff` or one other narrowed handoff. The derived tradition view disciplines the source, not the emitted outcome family.
- When such a derived tradition view is active, publish `SourceSetFamily`, use `DerivedViewKind` when the distinction matters to interpretation or later shipping, use `SourceSetComposition` only when several source-set families were genuinely composed, and keep `BasePaletteRef=SoTAPaletteDescriptionId` recoverable alongside the emitted result.
- If the derivation depends on one declared `Q` or one reachability or coverage rule, cite that declared basis directly in DRR and SCR records or equivalent basis pins rather than leaving the derivation implicit.
- If no derived tradition view is active, stay with the declared palette, front, archive, or shortlist families already named by the selector record.

#### G.5:4.4d - Worked publication closure slice

Three short contrasts keep the publication closure rule practical.

**Several survivors, no public order belongs to the result.**
When the selector has retained more than one admissible family but no downstream public order belongs to the published result, `G.5` should close as one `Shortlist` over the registered surviving rows:

```text
Shortlist(
  members = [family_A, family_C],
  shortlistId = shortlist_17,
  ordering = unordered,
  basisPins = [pathSlice_41, scr_22],
  nextUse = downstream_comparison
)
```

**Order now materially belongs to the published result.**
When one ordered public handoff is required, `G.5` should say so directly instead of leaving order implicit:

```text
RankedShortlist(
  members = [family_B, family_A],
  shortlistId = shortlist_23,
  ordering = ranked,
  basisPins = [pathSlice_77, scr_44],
  nextUse = specialist_handoff
)
```

**No admissible candidate survives.**
When no family clears the pinned admissibility or evidence gates, `G.5` should close as one abstain or escalation result rather than as one empty shortlist pretending to be progress:

```text
Abstain(
  blockingPins = [cg_min_evidence, crossing_bundle_missing],
  basisPins = [pathSlice_91, scr_61],
  nextUse = escalation
)
```

The practical distinction is simple: an internal retained subset can remain real upstream without yet being one public selector result. `G.5` begins only when that selector-facing publication question starts, and it closes only after the declared outcome kind, any applicable public selected-set label, surviving members or handoff content, and basis pins are emitted directly.

Most selector-side use can stop after `G.5:4.4d`. The blocks below are extension declarations used only when the corresponding mode is actually active.

All blocks below are extension declarations: they declare `Uses` and required pins, but do not redefine semantics already defined in the referenced patterns.

**GPatternExtension block: `G.5:Ext.EELog`**

* `PatternScopeId`: `G.5:Ext.EELog`
* `GPatternExtensionId`: `EELog`
* `GPatternExtensionKind`: `MethodSpecific`
* `GoverningPatternId`: `C.19`
* `Uses`: `{C.19}`
* `⊑` and `⊑⁺`: `∅`

* `RSCRTriggerKindIds`: `{RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta, RSCRTriggerKindId.FreshnessOrDecayEvent}`
* `Notes (extension discipline; semantics cited):`

  * This block activates exploration and exploitation-governed dispatch.
  * Post‑2015 examples that typically land here: modern bandit‑style or Bayesian selection under explicit risk budgets; adaptive evaluation and probing regimes; safe‑exploration variants where “abstain” or “degrade” is policy-bound.

**GPatternExtension block: `G.5:Ext.SoSLOG`**

* `PatternScopeId`: `G.5:Ext.SoSLOG`

  * `SoSLogBranchId[]` *(including escalation branches, if used)*
  * `FailureBehaviorPolicyId` *(if degrade behavior is made explicit)*
  * `MaturityRungId[]?` *(when maturity ladders are used as gates; semantics come from `C.23`)*
  * `AdmissibilityLedgerRef?` *(when selector consumes admissibility rows rather than recomputing thresholds)*
* `RSCRTriggerKindIds`: `{RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.MaturityRungChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.EvidencePathOrSourceRelationEdit}`
* `Notes (extension discipline; semantics cited):`

  * This block pins dispatch decisions to explicit rule and branch ids, enabling auditable “why” without inventing a fourth acceptance status.

**GPatternExtension block: `G.5:Ext.NQD`**

  * `DescriptorMapRef.edition`
  * `DistanceDefRef.edition`
  * `InsertionPolicyRef`
  * `TaskSignatureRef` *(when QD is enabled via TaskSignature flags or traits)*
  * `DHCMethodRef.edition?` *(when diversity and coverage telemetry is pinned to a DHC method)*
* `RSCRTriggerKindIds`: `{RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta, RSCRTriggerKindId.FreshnessOrDecayEvent}`
* `Notes (extension discipline; semantics cited):`

  * G.5 core remains QD‑agnostic; QD semantics are governed by `C.18`.
  * Post-2015 families that typically use this extension declaration: MAP-Elites-class QD including later archive-centric refinements, CMA-ME-class hybrids, modern illumination and coverage telemetry regimes where admissibility and edition pinning matter.

  * `GeneratorFamilyId[]`
  * `TransferRulesRef.edition` *(mandatory when Open‑Ended is enabled)*
  * `EnvironmentValidityRegionRef?`
  * `CoEvoCouplerRef[]?`
  * `SoSLogBranchId[]?` *(when validity of generated tasks is gated by explicit branches)*
* `RSCRTriggerKindIds`: `{RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta, RSCRTriggerKindId.FreshnessOrDecayEvent}`
* `Notes (extension discipline; semantics cited):`

  * This block enables declared sets of `{Environment, MethodFamily}` pairs without redefining generator semantics in G.5.
  * Post‑2015 examples typically referenced via `G.2` family cards: POET‑class and later open‑ended and co‑evolutionary regimes, including enhanced variants where transfer policies and validity gates must be edition‑pinned.

#### G.5:4.4e - Selector-facing outcome kinds

- `SelectionSlot` returns one selector outcome, not one forced single winner.
- The emitted result should declare its `SelectorOutcomeKind`.
- `SetResultFamily` is required only when `SelectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome`.
- `HandoffKind` is required only when `SelectorOutcomeKind = HandoffOutcome`; `SpecialistHandoff` is one handoff kind, not one set-result family head.
- `Front` names the non-dominated source set under the declared `DominanceSet`.
- `Archive` names the retained exploration archive under the declared retention policy.
- `Shortlist` names the lens-declared selected set emitted from `SelectionSlot`.
- `RankedShortlist` names one ordered specialization of that shortlist result.
- `ShortlistId` is the emitted public token when the shortlist publication must be carried or cited.
- `ChoiceSet` may be used only as the mathematical set gloss for that shortlist when the set object itself is under analysis; it does not replace the public shortlist head.
- `PortfolioMode` states how the selector operated; it does not rename the emitted set result.
- The default `PortfolioMode=Archive` means that an unspecified selector or generator operating mode must preserve retained exploration evidence rather than pretending one current front or selected shortlist has already been emitted. It does not make every returned object an `Archive`, does not override `SetResultFamily`, and does not change the declared `DominanceSet`.
- If one selector consumes both a front and an archive, say so explicitly rather than blurring them into one generic portfolio.
- If one selector consumes one derived tradition view, keep that derived view explicit rather than silently treating it as the default meaning of `Tradition`.
- `SetResultFamily`, `SourceSetFamily`, `SourceSetComposition`, `SubjectKind`, `DerivedViewKind`, `BasePaletteRef`, `PromotionPolicy`, and `RetentionIntent=steppingStone` are declaration fields, refs, or policy pins around the returned outcome; they are not additional emitted set results.
- `SourceSetFamily` names the immediate declared source-set family.
- `SourceSetComposition` is used only when the selector genuinely consumed more than one source-set family such as `Front` and `Archive`.
- If that source set is one derived tradition view, keep the base palette recoverable alongside it.
- `DerivedViewKind` may name which derived tradition view is active when that distinction matters to interpretation or later publication.
- `DerivedViewKind` does not replace `SourceSetFamily`, `SetResultFamily`, or `Shortlist`.
- `BasePaletteRef` is one cited ref or id, not one kind.
- If one selected result comes from one declared source set, publish that `SourceSetFamily` rather than asking the reader to infer it from one mode flag.
- `PromotionPolicy` is required when tie-break or telemetry signals are promoted into dominance.
- The selector may consume one declared source set and one declared choice lens without trying to explain the whole reason why another probe was worth its cost.
- When `CostToProbe`, `ValueOfInformation`, `ValueOfComputation`, `explore_share`, `backstop_confidence`, or sequencing pressures matter, keep them explicit in the surrounding choice doctrine instead of smuggling them into set-result declaration fields.
- Selector-facing results should name the set-result kind, source-set kind, derived-view declaration when needed, the emitted shortlist family, and promotion or default declaration.
- Those selector-facing field values should use controlled tokens, cited ids, or already-declared head labels rather than selector-local prose values.

### G.5:5 - Archetypal Grounding

**Tell (archetype).**
**System** must choose among rival families without lying about measurement admissibility, crossings, or evidence. **Episteme** insists that what is chosen must remain comparable, auditable, and stable under refresh.

**Show 1 (multi-Tradition dispatch; unordered shortlist).**
A `CG-Frame` includes multiple decision-theoretic families with different admissibility assumptions. Evidence for some CHR traits is incomplete.
System registers families (S1), then runs `Select` (S3) on a pinned `TaskSignatureRef`. Eligibility is tri-state; some families **abstain** due to missing minimal-evidence pins. Among remaining candidates, only a partial order is admissible, so the selector publishes one `Shortlist` with explicit `basisPins` instead of inventing one scalar winner. No shadow acceptance logic appears in the selector; it consumes pinned acceptance and admissibility records.

**Show 2 (specialist handoff; ranked publication).**
A bounded-specialization comparison keeps two method families live, but downstream handoff now requires one ordered public result rather than one merely unordered retained set.
The admissible `G.5` result is therefore one `RankedShortlist` with explicit ordering, `ShortlistId`, and handoff-facing `nextUse`, so the publication itself states whether the order is public.

**Show 3 (no admissible survivor; abstain or escalation).**
A frame fails one admissibility gate and one minimal-evidence gate at the same time.
The truthful `G.5` result is one abstain or escalation publication that names the blocking pins and the next downstream use boundary, not one empty shortlist that leaves downstream users unsure whether selection silently failed or admissibly stopped.

### G.5:6 - Bias-Annotation

Potential biases and failure modes this pattern explicitly guards against:

* **Monoculture bias (single Tradition dominance by default).** Mitigation: registry requires explicit eligibility and assurance records; selection is set‑returning under partial orders; method‑specific policies stay explicit pins rather than hard-coded defaults.
* **Hidden scalarisation bias.** Mitigation: set-return semantics is pinned through `G.Core`; dominance regimes are explicit and each default cites one declared governing definition.
* **“Tool equals method” bias.** Mitigation: notation independence and prohibition of tool keywords in core registry and eligibility fields; tool choices are outside the core.
* **Cross‑Context leakage bias.** Mitigation: explicit crossing pins only; Bridge and CL are required when crossings occur; no implicit crossings.
* **Survivorship bias in refresh.** Mitigation: RSCR triggers are typed and id-based; freshness, decay, and telemetry deltas are first‑class causes with canonical ids.

### G.5:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ConformanceId   | Statement |
| --------------- | ----------|
| `CC‑G5‑CoreRef` | **Core conformance bridge.** `G.5` is conformant only if the **effective** `G.Core` obligations referenced by `G.5:4.1 (GCoreLinkageManifest)` are satisfied (after profile and set expansion plus explicit deltas). |
| `CC‑G5.0`       | Core standards **SHALL** remain notation‑independent; vendor or tool keywords are forbidden in registry, eligibility, assurance, or selector‑kernel obligations (E.5.*). |
| `CC‑G5.1`       | Every `MethodFamily` **SHALL** declare an `EligibilityStandardRef` using CHR and CAL terms (typed; edition‑pinned where applicable). Standards **SHALL NOT** rely on tool‑specific keywords.  |
| `CC-G5.2`       | Selection **SHALL** be a pure function of `TaskSignatureRef` and pinned policy or edition refs; side effects are limited to emitting DRR and SCR pins, telemetry triggers, and RSCR triggers (no hidden mutation of constraint-bearing spec refs). |
| `CC‑G5.3`       | **Delegated (ID‑continuity).** Cross‑Context use **MUST** follow `G.Core` crossing visibility and penalty assignment semantics. **Delegation targets:** `CC‑GCORE‑CROSS‑1`, `CC‑GCORE‑PEN‑1`.  |
| `CC‑G5.4`       | **Default rule for** `DefaultId.GammaFoldForR_eff`. The selector **MUST** default to the weakest‑link rule for `R_eff` and record contributors in SCR; it **MAY** use an alternative Γ‑fold only when provided by an explicitly pinned policy or profile with proof obligations satisfied (monotonicity; boundary behavior). |
| `CC-G5.5`       | Ordinal scales **MUST NOT** be averaged or subtracted; any aggregation or comparison must respect CHR scale typing and admissibility constraints, including CSLC where applicable. |
| `CC‑G5.6`       | Method and generator family identities **SHALL** be published to UTS with the required naming discipline (twin labels where applicable; deprecations follow lexical continuity rules). *(Core conformance applies; `G.5` adds the registry‑specific publication obligation.)* |
| `CC‑G5.7`       | **Conditional.** If `G.5:Ext.EELog` is present, exploration **MUST** be budgeted under the pinned exploration and exploitation log policy; probe outcomes **MUST** feed refresh through canonical RSCR trigger kinds. |
| `CC‑G5.8`       | **CG‑Frame gate enforced.** Selection rejects or abstains from candidates that do not meet the pinned `CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence` requirements for the characteristics they cite. |
| `CC-G5.9`       | **Delegated (ID-continuity).** Set-return semantics are pinned through `G.Core`. **Delegation target:** `CC-GCORE-SET-1`. Candidate ordering **MUST** be admissible over typed traits and admissibility constraints. If only a partial order is available, selection **MUST** return one declared selector outcome, for example one `SetResultOutcome` with `Shortlist` or `RankedShortlist`, one `HandoffOutcome` with `SpecialistHandoff`, or another pinned outcome result, with no forced totalisation via inadmissible scalarisation. |
| `CC-G5.10`      | **SCR completeness.** SCR **MUST** enumerate Gamma-fold contributors when used, referenced constraint-bearing spec editions, the evidence citations (`PathId` and `PathSliceId`) used in gating and rationale, and `MinimalEvidence` gating verdicts by lane and carrier when such gating is relied upon. |
| `CC‑G5.11`      | **Delegated (ID‑continuity).** Tri‑state eligibility and acceptance semantics plus unknown handling are pinned through `G.Core`. **Delegation target:** `CC‑GCORE‑GUARD‑1`. *(Includes the rule that `degrade(...)` is expressed through a pinned FailureBehavior or SoS‑LOG branch id, not as a fourth status.)* |
| `CC-G5.12`      | **No "universal" cross-Tradition scoring.** Cross-Tradition selection **MUST NOT** rely on a single numeric formula not justified by pinned CHR and CAL constraints and the constraint-bearing spec refs. If a triad or selected set **claims universality**, it **MUST** satisfy **explicit, pinned** heterogeneity gates with cited ids and pins, for example `FamilyCoverage >= k` and `MinInterFamilyDistance >= delta_family`, where `k` and `delta_family` are declared by the pinned policy, TaskSignature, or SoTA pack, and cite the relevant **Context Card id (F.1)** in DRR and SCR records; otherwise treat the outcome as Context-local. |
| `CC‑G5.13`      | **Conditional.** If the selector consumes admissibility or maturity records (e.g., through `G.5:Ext.SoSLOG`), it **MUST NOT** recompute thresholds; it consumes pinned admissibility ledger rows and cites clause and rung ids in audit pins. |
| `CC‑G5.14`      | **Φ(CL) and Φ_plane discipline.** If crossing or plane penalties are applied, the active penalty policy ids (e.g., `Φ(CL)`, `Φ_plane`) **MUST** be explicit in audit pins, and the pinned policies **MUST** satisfy the monotone and bounded requirements asserted by their cited constraint-bearing spec refs and be published through those same cited spec refs (e.g., `CG‑Spec`). SCR **MUST** record the policy id in use; penalty assignment semantics remain pinned through `G.Core`. |
| `CC-G5.15`      | Unit and scale admissibility **MUST** be established via CSLC (A.18) before any aggregation or Gamma-fold; unit and scale mismatches are a fail-fast defect. |
| `CC‑G5.16`      | Hidden thresholds are forbidden. Thresholds live in explicitly pinned acceptance or eligibility policy records, not in selector prose, LOG shells, or code.  |
| `CC‑G5.17`      | ReferencePlane **MUST** be declared (pinned) for any claim that is used in dispatch, and the selector’s audit records must cite it (including plane‑crossing pins when applicable). |
| `CC-G5.18`      | Numeric comparisons and aggregations used by dispatch **MUST** cite an admissible, edition-pinned comparator or spec publication (as provided by the constraint-bearing spec refs); inadmissible mixes of scale types are forbidden. |
| `CC-G5.19`      | **Conditional (QD).** If `G.5:Ext.NQD` is present, the required QD telemetry triple (quality, diversity, and QD summary) **MUST** be computable and publishable under the pinned descriptor and distance definitions and archive policy, without redefining their semantics in G.5. |
| `CC‑G5.20`      | **Conditional (QD).** QD and illumination summaries are treated as telemetry unless explicitly promoted by a pinned acceptance or policy record; the selector must record the promoting policy id in audit pins. |
| `CC-G5.21`      | **Conditional (Archive and QD).** Any use of archives **MUST** declare `InsertionPolicyRef` and pin the required editions for reproducibility, including descriptor and distance definitions and any method editions they depend on. |
| `CC‑G5.22`      | **Conditional (QD).** Twin‑naming discipline for descriptor vs plain space (if used) must be respected (distinct objects; no aliasing).  |
| `CC-G5.23`      | **Default rule for** `DefaultId.PortfolioMode`. The selector **MUST** expose `PortfolioMode` with values `Pareto` or `Archive`, with **default = `Archive`**, and echo it in DRR and SCR records and declared selector results when not explicitly overridden by pinned policy or TaskSignature. The default is a retention and evidence-preservation policy, not a public selected-set label, not a dominance default, and not a substitute for `SetResultFamily`. Epsilon-fronts are allowed as *local* decision aids under `CG-Spec` when explicitly pinned. |
| `CC-G5.23a`     | **Parity-run publication.** If parity harness is in use, a selector or generator **MUST** publish a parity run and `ParityCard` to **UTS** (see `G.9`). This obligation remains mandatory irrespective of dominance policy or `PortfolioMode` policy. |
| `CC‑G5.24`      | **Conditional (Open‑Ended).** If `G.5:Ext.OpenEndedFamilyWiring` is present, the selector **MUST** return declared sets of `{Environment, MethodFamily}` pairs as set‑valued outcomes under explicit pins. |
| `CC‑G5.25`      | **Conditional (Open‑Ended).** In Open‑Ended mode, `TransferRulesRef.edition` is mandatory and **MUST** be visible to telemetry and RSCR triggers.  |
| `CC-G5.26`      | **Conditional (Archive and QD).** Within any archive niche or cell, ordering and tie-breaks **MUST** remain admissible over compatible scales; inadmissible mixed-scale weighted sums are forbidden. |
| `CC‑G5.27`      | If the selector cites any `GateCrossing`, the corresponding `CrossingBundle` publication **MUST** be present and conformant; missing or non‑conformant `CrossingBundle` blocks downstream consumption. |
| `CC‑G5.28`      | **Default rule for** `DefaultId.DominanceRegime`. `DominanceRegime` **SHALL** default to `ParetoOnly`. Any inclusion of additional telemetry dimensions into dominance (e.g., illumination) requires an explicitly pinned acceptance or policy record and must be recorded in audit pins. **Parity‑run publication (CC‑G5.23a) remains mandatory** irrespective of dominance policy. |
| `CC-G5.29`      | **Conditional (QD and Open-Ended).** Any telemetry event that materially changes an archive state or retained-set state **MUST** log `PathSliceId`, the active policy id, and the active editions of the relevant definition pins (`DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, and `TransferRulesRef.edition` when applicable) and expose them to RSCR triggers. |
| `CC‑G5.30`      | **No Strategy minting.** Within `G.5`, “strategy” is a policy‑bound composition template; the pattern **SHALL NOT** mint a durable U-kind named `Strategy` (E.10 and E.24.UK discipline). If a stable reference is needed, publish composition and policy ids (e.g., UTS entries) rather than minting a universal kind. |
| `CC-G5.31`      | **Strategy hint on non-admissible sets.** If selection yields `CandidateSet = EMPTY`, the selector **SHALL** emit an explicit escalation hint (`ActionHint`) that is compatible with DRR and SCR records and auditable: include at minimum the top three blocking constraints as cited ids and pins, and where applicable include the relevant edition pins, for example `TransferRulesRef.edition` in Open-Ended mode, to guide exploration under explicitly pinned lenses such as the exploration and exploitation log policy. |
| `CC‑G5.32`      | **Parity‑run publication and admissible roll-ups.** If parity harness is in use, parity publication is required per `CC‑G5.23a` (ID‑continuity). Any scalar roll-up or summary view **MUST** be admissible under **CG‑Spec** (no mixed‑scale sums), and published views must preserve set‑return semantics (no single‑score leaderboards as authoritative outputs without an explicit, admissible comparator publication). |
| `CC‑G5.33`      | **Conditional (bounded specialization).** When the selection question is acquisition of usable specialization on a declared `TaskFamilyRef` or `TaskSignature`, selector outputs **SHALL** either publish `TaskFamilySpecializationProfile@Context` or cite equivalent pins carrying the `C.22.1` adaptation-signature fields needed for comparison: work-measure threshold target, prior exposure declaration, time-to-threshold, budget-to-threshold, post-threshold efficiency when relevant, and any declared transfer, retention, downside, or specialization-entry notes. |
| `CC‑G5.34`      | **Selected-set publication label.** When `SelectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome`, the published selected-set label **MUST** be explicit. Use `Shortlist` as the public selected-set label, `RankedShortlist` only when ordering materially belongs to the result, publish `ShortlistId` when one public identifier is emitted, and do not silently let `ChoiceSet` replace that public label. |
| `CC‑G5.34a`     | **Selector outcome typing.** Published selector results **MUST** declare `SelectorOutcomeKind`. `SetResultFamily` is required only when `SelectorOutcomeKind = SetResultOutcome`; `HandoffKind` is required only when `SelectorOutcomeKind = HandoffOutcome`. Non-set outcomes **MUST NOT** masquerade as one public selected-set label. |
| `CC‑G5.35`      | **Publication closure.** Any published selector result **MUST** state the declared `SelectorOutcomeKind`, any applicable public selected-set label, retained members or narrowed handoff content, ordering status (when applicable), and basis pins directly in the emitted result rather than relying on upstream `C.11`, `C.19`, or `C.24` notes. |
| `CC‑G5.36`      | **Neighboring-pattern boundary.** If the current question is still local choice among already-available options, pool policy over still-live candidate lines, or enactment planning after choice, `G.5` **MUST** consume the published result from `C.11`, `C.19`, or `C.24` rather than restating those patterns as if publication itself decided the matter. |
| `CC‑G5.37`      | **Derived tradition-view publication discipline.** If the selector publishes one result through a derived tradition view such as `TraditionFront` or `TraditionArchive`, it **MUST** keep the declared base `SourceSetFamily` explicit, keep `SoTAPaletteDescription` recoverable through `BasePaletteRef`, and **MUST NOT** let the derived view become the default meaning of `Tradition`, `TraditionPalette`, or the base palette. |
| `CC‑G5.38`      | **Causal method dispatch declarations.** If method selection involves causal methods, each compared method **MUST** declare `causalMethodUseClassification` as observational predictor, intervention optimizer, counterfactual strategy, causal fairness estimator, causal-RL policy, or simulation-only method, and **MUST** carry `causalUseSupportRecordRef` and `causalUseSupportVerdict` when it consumes `C.28` causal-use support rather than treating method dispatch as causal certification. |

### G.5:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* **Anti‑pattern: “Selector as a shadow spec.”**
  *Symptom:* local acceptance or admissibility rules appear in selector prose or code, diverging from CN, CG, and CAL.
  *Avoid:* govern constraint semantics through `CNSpecRef` and `CGSpecRef` plus pinned CAL records; keep G.5 core as a boundary.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Implicit crossings.”**
  *Symptom:* cross‑Context reuse is claimed without Bridge and CL pins, or without cited `CrossingBundle`.
  *Avoid:* require explicit crossing pins; block consumption without publication.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Hidden scalarisation.”**
  *Symptom:* partial orders are flattened into single winners “for convenience”.
  *Avoid:* return declared sets; make dominance regimes explicit; keep telemetry report‑only unless promoted by explicit policy.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Method specifics in the selector head.”**
  *Symptom:* QD, OEE, or preference models become mandatory for basic dispatch.
  *Avoid:* keep them in `G.5:Ext.*` blocks with explicit pins and `Uses`.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Churn by meaning.”**
  *Symptom:* registry entries are “renamed” to reflect updated interpretation, breaking continuity.
  *Avoid:* publish a new edition or deprecate; keep stable ids; use explicit edition pins and deprecation notices.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Publication hidden in upstream reasoning.”**
  *Symptom:* the retained set exists only as one implication inside `C.11`, `C.19`, or `C.24`, while `G.5` never names the published selected-set label.
  *Avoid:* publish the selected-set result directly, with explicit label, members, and basis pins, instead of leaving the shortlist implicit in upstream doctrine.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Published result without closure record.”**
  *Symptom:* a `Shortlist`, narrowed handoff, or abstain result is named, but the emitted result still does not state its members, ordering status, or basis pins.
  *Avoid:* publish the head, retained members, ordering status, abstain or escalation condition, and basis pins directly in `G.5`.

### G.5:9 - Consequences

* **Auditable plurality.** Multiple Traditions can co-exist without forced semantic flattening; dispatch remains explainable and evidence-pinned.
* **Core stability.** Universal invariants are pinned through `G.Core`; method innovation and generator innovation do not churn the selector head.
* **Evolvability.** Registries allow growth, retirement, and refresh with typed RSCR causes and explicit payload pins.
* **Composability.** Strategy templates and fallbacks remain admissibility-checked and portable across implementations.
* **Recoverable publication.** Selected-set results can now travel downstream as explicit shortlist-family, ranked-shortlist, or abstain or escalation results rather than one hidden implication inside upstream reasoning.

### G.5:10 - Rationale

* **Why registries?** Dispatch requires stable, auditable family objects with explicit eligibility and assurance records; otherwise selection collapses into ad-hoc tooling.
* **Why separation via Extensions?** QD, OEE, preference-learning, and similar families are fast-moving and method-specific; making them part of the selector head would force a universal semantics and violate strict distinction.
* **Why set-return?** Partial orders are common and often the only admissible representation under heterogeneous scales; set-return preserves semantics and makes tie criteria explicit.
* **Why explicit defaults with one declared source?** Defaults are unavoidable; single-source indexing prevents competing defaults from silently diverging across patterns.
* **Why selected-set publication here?** Once the current question is to publish one retained set for downstream use, the selector should publish that result directly instead of leaving it implicit in local choice, pool-policy, or enactment notes written for other purposes.

### G.5:11 - SoTA-Echoing

This pattern is designed to carry extension declarations for, not redefine, post-2015 SoTA families through `Uses` plus edition and policy pins:

* **Quality-Diversity survey currentness (2026 DOI `10.1016/j.swevo.2025.102240`, ScienceDirect `S2210650225003979`).** Survey support keeps approaches, applications, archives, diversity use, and challenges visible, but it does not replace FPF governing loci. The practical implication for G.5 is publication closure only: if the selected result is a `Shortlist`, `RankedShortlist`, declared `ExplorationArchive`, `Front`, `Q-front`, abstain, or escalation, publish the declared outcome kind, source-set family, ordering status, and basis pins instead of letting survey taxonomy name the result.
* **QD-as-MOO and archive-centric QD lines.** Current QD work can return fronts, archives, and set-shaped outcomes under descriptor, distance, dominance, and comparator editions. The practical implication is that G.5 publishes the selector-facing result without redefining archive and front relations; `C.18` and `A.19.CPM` keep descriptor, archive, front, and comparator meaning.
* **Cultural and style selected-set labels.** Music, dance, and cultural-market source rows motivate labels such as `StyleShortlist` or `TraditionShortlist` only after term bridges and cultural-evolution case meaning are clear. The practical implication is to keep `DerivedViewKind`, `BasePaletteRef`, and `SourceSetFamily` visible; G.5 does not define style, tradition, canon, or platform semantics.
* **Quality-Diversity and illumination (post-2015 refinements).** Archive-centric QD families fit naturally as `G.5:Ext.NQD` extension declarations with explicit descriptor, distance, and insertion pins. The practical implication is to keep publication honest about whether the selector is returning one admissible set, one ranked result, or no admissible survivor at all.
* **Open-Endedness (post-2015 line; POET `arXiv:1901.01753`, AlphaEvolve `arXiv:2506.13131`).** POET-class and later open-ended or co-evolutionary families use generator registries plus `TransferRulesRef.edition` pins. The practical implication is to publish pair- or retained-set-shaped results explicitly rather than silently squeezing them into one false single-family winner.

* **Algorithm selection and meta-selection (Thompson sampling tutorial `arXiv:1707.02038`; Bayesian optimization tutorial `arXiv:1807.02811`).** Modern selection under uncertainty, robust evaluation, and policy-driven probing use explicit policy records and typed telemetry pins, rather than hard-coded scoring rules. The practical safeguard is that the publication label and basis pins must still remain explicit after those policies have acted.
* **Budgeted specialist acquisition (current agentic-search source-pack pressure via `G.2`).** Current agentic search lines compete on time or budget to threshold plus truthful selected-set return when heterogeneous specialists remain non-dominated. Treat those rows as source-pack pressure until cited by `G.2`; `G.5` keeps specialization profiles and set-return semantics explicit instead of forcing one static breadth winner.
* **Preference-learning comparators.** Interactive and learned-preference regimes are treated as comparator or policy records with explicit editions when they are actually declared.

SoTA here is treated as **best-known practice for a declared goal and constraint regime**, not whatever is currently popular.
Evidence-source clarification: peer-reviewed source references carry the most direct citation strength for typed comparison, budget-to-threshold, and truthful selected-set return. Faster-moving workshop, poster, or frontier-exploration lines remain explicit source references for specialization-entry or open-ended pressure, not silently equal evidence for every selector claim.

### G.5:12 - Relations

**Builds on (normative):** `G.Core` (core invariants + linkage discipline).

**Uses (conceptual dependencies; cited via pins and ids):**

* Governing spec refs: `A.19 (CN‑Spec)`, `G.0 (CG‑Spec)`.
* Upstream object sets: `G.1 (CG‑Frame Card)`, `G.2 (SoTA Pack)`, `G.3 (CHR Pack)`, `G.4 (CAL Pack)`.
* Evidence and crossings: `G.6` (EvidenceGraph; `PathId` and `PathSliceId`), `G.7` (Bridge and CL calibration), `E.18` and `A.21` (CrossingBundle and GateChecks).
* Planning and enactment boundary: `A.15.3 (SlotFillingsPlanItem)` as the plannedBaselineRef (cited, not redefined).
* Causal-use method dispatch: `C.28` when method selection involves causal effect, counterfactual comparison, causal fairness, causal policy, causal RL, or simulation-only causal-use claims.
* Optional method or generator extensions through `G.5:Ext.*`: `C.18`, `C.19`, `C.23`, plus extension-bearing patterns admitted by a governing Part G relation when they add extra selector pins.
* Mathematical-lens use: apply `C.29` when a selector input depends on a claim-relevant comparator, distance, descriptor geometry, embedding, normalization, surrogate model, learned representation, QD archive descriptor, model-family label, or model-selection basis whose mathematical object, mapping mode, preserved or lost structure, or stop condition is not yet recoverable. `C.29` may return no math-lens use, a lens-candidate note, a one-line note, a mini-card, a full card, or a note naming the direct governing pattern for the stated selector use. It does not publish the selected set, selector policy, registry row, shortlist, ranked shortlist, or selector evidence pins; those stay in `G.5` and its governing refs.

**Publishes to:** `UTS` (family ids, selector policy records, and selected-set identities such as `ShortlistId` when one public result is emitted), `G.6` (audit citations), RSCR emission records (typed triggers and payload pins), and downstream packs through `G.10` shipping publications.

**Coordinates with:** `C.11` for local choice results, `C.19` for pool-policy records, `C.32.P2S` when publication of a selected set is one stage in architecture problem-to-structure carry-through, `C.35` when discovered or generated structure-bearing outputs are not yet selected-set publications, `C.24` for enactment-facing next-action records, and the accepted Q-Front shortlist-family continuity line when the published selected-set label is one shortlist-family result.

Architecture discovery boundary: when a generated or discovered structure-bearing output is only a carrier, description, query result, graph, cluster, or search trace, use `C.35` before G.5. Use G.5 only when the live claim is publication of a selected set with selector-policy and selected-set identity.
