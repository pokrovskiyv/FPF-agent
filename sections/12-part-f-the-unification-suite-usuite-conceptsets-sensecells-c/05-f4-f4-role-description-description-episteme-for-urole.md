## F.4 - Role Description - Description Episteme for U.Role

> **Type:** Definitional (D)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

### F.4:0 - Use This When

**Plain name.** Role-description episteme.

Use this pattern when a project needs a short, reusable description that makes one work-facing `U.Role` recognizable, teachable, and checkable inside one `U.BoundedContext`.

Typical moments:

- a project has a role name such as `ReviewerRole`, `OperatorRole`, `InspectorRole`, `TransformerRole`, `ShipyardCoordinatorRole`, or `ModelCardReviewerRole`, but the bounded context, admissible holder kind, role invariants, capability expectations, or work-facing boundary are unclear;
- a method description names required roles, but readers cannot tell what role value is required before a `U.RoleAssignment` can be checked;
- a role name is starting to carry method, capability, work, permission, evidence, publication, or status claims that belong to neighboring patterns;
- a former source phrase says that a report, standard, dataset, theorem, dashboard, publication, or requirement has a "role" and the text must decide whether that phrase is a real work-facing role description or a direct episteme-use relation.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** The EntityOfConcern is the role-description episteme: a `U.Episteme` that describes one `U.Role` value in one bounded context. It is not the role value itself, not the holder, not a role assignment, not a capability, not a method description, not performed work, not a status-use relation, and not a publication form.

**Primary working reader.** The first reader is an engineer-manager, analyst, method author, or pattern author who must let people recognize a role while keeping role value, holder, assignment, capability, method, work, evidence use, status use, and publication use distinct.

**First useful move.** Name the role value being described, the bounded context that gives it meaning, the kind of holder admitted for role assignment, and the smallest set of role invariants that matters for the next assignment, method, work, naming, or bridge claim.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A role-description card becomes a hidden method, access policy, permission badge, evidence relation, status assertion, staffing plan, or work log. Then FPF grows one role ontology for acting holons and a second role-like ontology for epistemes, publications, statuses, and relation positions.

**What this buys.** A project can publish a compact, human-readable role description while keeping operational claims in their direct patterns. The role remains recognizable; the assignment remains checkable; capability, method, work, evidence, status, and publication claims stay inspectable instead of being smuggled into the role name.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If the current claim is the role value itself or role taxonomy, use `A.2`.
- If the current claim is which holder bears which role in which context and window, use `A.2.1`.
- If the current claim is role state or enactable-state admission, use `A.2.5`.
- If the current claim is role-requirement substitution, role incompatibility, role-factor qualification, or bundle expression, use `A.2.7`.
- If the current claim is capability, use `A.2.2`.
- If the current claim is method, method description, work plan, or performed work, use `A.15` and its neighbors.
- If the current claim is evidence use, status use, source use, standard use, requirement use, publication use, assurance use, gate use, or decision use of an episteme, use the direct pattern for that relation. Do not call that episteme a role holder.
- If the current issue is only a durable name, use `F.18`.
- If the current issue is cross-context sameness or translation, use `F.9`.
- If "role" means a relation position, use `A.6.5` SlotSpec discipline.

### F.4:1 - Problem Frame

Role descriptions are useful because a role value needs a recognizable description before people can assign it, name it, compare it, or use it in a method requirement. A role such as `InspectorRole` is not self-explanatory. The project needs to know which bounded context gives it meaning, what kind of holder can bear it, which role invariants matter, and which neighboring checks may become current.

The recurring failure is to make the role description carry too much. A compact card is tempting: put role, status, permission, evidence, capability, method, assignment, work, and publication cues into one "assignable" template. That looks convenient but creates duplicate ontology. A standard used as a requirement source becomes a "standard role"; a report used as evidence becomes an "evidence role"; an access-control label becomes a behavioral role; a role name becomes proof of capability or proof that work occurred.

F.4 therefore treats a role description as a description episteme about a work-facing `U.Role`. It may mention neighboring relations, but it does not absorb them.

### F.4:2 - Problem

Without this pattern:

1. **Role description and role value collapse.** The description is treated as if it were the `U.Role` value.
2. **Role description and assignment collapse.** A role name or card is treated as proof that a holder has the role.
3. **Role description and capability collapse.** A role name is treated as evidence that the holder can do the work.
4. **Role description and method collapse.** Role invariants become a hidden procedure or method description.
5. **Role description and performed work collapse.** A role card is treated as evidence that work happened.
6. **Status and evidence uses become roles.** Epistemes, publications, standards, datasets, and claims are put into role language because they are used in project reasoning.
7. **Relation positions become roles.** Slot positions in signatures, interfaces, evidence relations, or status-use relations are called roles.
8. **Cross-context labels overreach.** The same role-like word in two contexts is treated as one role description without a bridge.

### F.4:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Recognition vs ontology | A role description must be easy to read, but it cannot replace the role value, assignment relation, capability, method, or work occurrence. |
| Local meaning vs reuse | Role descriptions are context-bound, while role names may need subsequent durable naming or cross-context comparison. |
| Compactness vs completeness | A useful card is small, but the current claim may require neighboring checks for state, capability, method, assignment, evidence, or status. |
| Open-world use vs form burden | Some uses need only a role gloss; stronger uses need slot dispositions and neighboring references without pretending every slot is always filled. |
| Work-facing role ontology vs episteme-use ontology | Acting holons can hold work-facing roles. Epistemes are used through evidence, status, source, publication, requirement, explanation, assurance, or gate relations. |

### F.4:4 - Solution

Use a role-description episteme to describe one `U.Role` in one bounded context. The description gives readers enough to recognize and check the role, while sending neighboring claims to their governing patterns.

```text
RoleDescriptionCore:
  DescribedRoleSlot:
  BoundedContextSlot:
  HolderAdmissionSlot:
  RecognitionTextSlot:
  RoleInvariantSetSlot:
  RoleStateRequirementRefs:
  CapabilityRequirementRefs:
  MethodRequirementRefs:
  WorkUseBoundarySlot:
  NamingRefs:
  BridgeRefs:
  NonRoleUseBoundarySlot:
```

This is a description episteme shape, not a new assignment relation. Its publication may be a card, table row, method appendix, standard clause, or pattern section. The publication form is not the role description by default; it publishes or carries the description episteme.

#### F.4:4.1 - Core Slot Meanings

| Slot | Admitted value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DescribedRoleSlot` | `U.Role` | The role value being described. |
| `BoundedContextSlot` | `U.BoundedContext` | The context that gives the role value local meaning. |
| `HolderAdmissionSlot` | Holder kind or admission statement governed by `A.2` and `A.2.1` | What kind of acting holon may fill `RoleHolderSlot` in a role assignment. |
| `RecognitionTextSlot` | Short description episteme content | The first-minute description that lets a reader recognize the role. |
| `RoleInvariantSetSlot` | Small set of role invariants | Conditions that remain true of the role value in the bounded context. |
| `RoleStateRequirementRefs` | `A.2.5` references when current | Role-state or enactable-state requirements. |
| `CapabilityRequirementRefs` | `A.2.2` references when current | Ability or operating-envelope requirements; not created by the role name. |
| `MethodRequirementRefs` | `A.15`, `A.3.1`, or `A.3.2` references when current | Method or method-description requirements linked to the role. |
| `WorkUseBoundarySlot` | Boundary statement | What the role description does and does not say about performed work. |
| `NamingRefs` | `F.18` or local naming references when current | Durable role-name settlement and aliases. |
| `BridgeRefs` | `F.9` bridge references when current | Cross-context comparison or reuse of role-like senses. |
| `NonRoleUseBoundarySlot` | Boundary statement | Directs evidence, status, source, publication, requirement, definition, explanation, assurance, gate, and slot-position uses to their patterns. |

The slot list is an open-world discipline. A quick local description may fill only the role, context, recognition text, holder admission, and non-role boundary. A safety-critical work-admission use may need role-state, capability, method, assignment-window, and evidence references through neighboring patterns.

#### F.4:4.2 - Role Description vs Neighboring Values

Keep these distinctions:

| Current claim | Governing pattern |
| --- | --- |
| What role value is this? | `A.2` |
| Which holder bears the role in which context and window? | `A.2.1` |
| Is the assignment in an admitted role state? | `A.2.5` |
| Can the holder do the relevant work? | `A.2.2` |
| Which method, method description, plan, or work occurrence is current? | `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, `A.3.1`, `A.3.2` |
| How do role values satisfy requirements, conflict, qualify, or bundle inside one context? | `A.2.7` |
| What durable name should this role have? | `F.18` |
| How do role-like senses compare across contexts? | `F.9` |
| How is an episteme used as evidence, source, standard, requirement, status bearer, publication, or assurance input? | Direct episteme-use, evidence-use, status-use, source-use, publication-use, requirement-use, or assurance pattern |
| Which relation position admits which filler kind? | `A.6.5` |

F.4 may point to these patterns; it does not copy their ontology.

#### F.4:4.3 - Positive Construction Rule

Write a role description in this order:

1. Name the described `U.Role` and bounded context.
2. State the admitted holder kind for role assignment.
3. Give one short recognition paragraph.
4. List the role invariants that make the role different from neighboring roles.
5. State the non-role boundary: what this description does not say about assignment, capability, method, work, evidence, status, permission, publication, or slot positions.
6. Add neighboring references only when the current use depends on them.
7. If the name is durable, public, cross-context, or Core-facing, settle it through `F.18`; if the sense crosses contexts, use `F.9`.

### F.4:5 - Invariants

1. **One described role.** A role description describes exactly one `U.Role` value in the current application.
2. **One bounded context.** The role description is local to one `U.BoundedContext`; cross-context reuse needs `F.9`.
3. **Description boundary.** The role description is a `U.Episteme`; it is not the role value, assignment relation, holder, capability, method, work, or status-use relation.
4. **Work-facing holder boundary.** The holder admitted by a role assignment is a system or acting holon admitted by the governing work or method pattern. An episteme is not a role holder because it is used as evidence, source, standard, requirement, definition, explanation, status bearer, publication, or assurance input.
5. **No hidden capability.** Capability requirements may be referenced, but the role description does not prove capability.
6. **No hidden method.** Method requirements may be referenced, but the role description is not a method description.
7. **No hidden work.** A role description may enable work attribution checks, but it is not evidence that work occurred.
8. **No status-template fusion.** Status-use and evidence-use relations are direct relations, not a second branch of role description.
9. **Slot discipline.** If a source says "role" for a relation position, recover `SlotKind`, `ValueKind`, and `RefKind` through `A.6.5`.
10. **Name after meaning.** Durable naming follows `F.18` only after role value, context, and local sense are recovered.

### F.4:6 - Reasoning Primitives

Use these judgement schemas as thinking checks.

```text
RoleDescription RD describes Role R in Context C
  -> RD is a description episteme about R, not R itself.
```

```text
RoleDescription RD admits holder kind HK for Role R
  -> A RoleAssignment may use a holder of HK only if A.2.1 and neighboring checks admit it.
```

```text
RoleDescription RD lists capability requirement CapReq
  -> capability claim is governed by A.2.2, not by RD.
```

```text
RoleDescription RD lists method requirement MReq
  -> method or method-description claim is governed by A.15, A.3.1, or A.3.2.
```

```text
Source says "X has role Y" and X is an episteme
  -> recover direct episteme-use relation before considering U.Role.
```

### F.4:7 - Worked Cases

#### F.4:7.1 - Pump Inspector Role

```text
RoleDescription:
  DescribedRoleSlot: PumpInspectorRole
  BoundedContextSlot: PlantMaintenance_2026
  HolderAdmissionSlot: maintenance technician, inspection robot, or service team admitted as acting holon by the maintenance context
  RecognitionTextSlot: the role used for inspecting pump condition before maintenance work is admitted
  RoleInvariantSetSlot:
    - concerns inspection of pump condition in PlantMaintenance_2026
    - does not perform repair work by itself
    - requires current assignment before work attribution
  CapabilityRequirementRefs: PumpInspectionCapability when the work claim depends on ability
  MethodRequirementRefs: PumpInspectionMethodDescription when the work claim depends on method
  NonRoleUseBoundarySlot: inspection report is evidence use, not a role holder
```

The description makes `PumpInspectorRole` recognizable. It does not say that Robot-7 holds the role, can inspect, followed the method, or performed work. Those claims go to `A.2.1`, `A.2.2`, `A.15`, and evidence patterns.

#### F.4:7.2 - Reviewer Role and Review Report

`ReviewerRole` in `PatternReview_2026` may have a role description with invariants about checking a pattern against declared scales. A review report produced by a reviewer is an episteme used as evidence or source for a pattern-quality claim. The report is not the role holder and does not hold an evidence role.

Use:

- `A.2` for `ReviewerRole`;
- `F.4` for the role-description episteme;
- `A.2.1` for `Alice#ReviewerRole:PatternReview_2026@Window`;
- `A.15.1` for the review work occurrence;
- `A.10`, `B.3`, `G.6`, or a direct evidence-use pattern for the review report as evidence.

#### F.4:7.3 - Standard Used as Requirement Source

The sentence "ISO 42010 has the architecture-standard role in this work" is unsafe if it makes the standard a role holder.

Repair it as:

```text
ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 is used as a standard-use or requirement-use episteme
for architecture-description claims in this bounded context.
```

Only a system or acting holon can hold a work-facing role. The standard may constrain, evidence, or source a claim through direct episteme-use relations.

#### F.4:7.4 - Access Role Is Not Automatically Work-Facing Role

RBAC "role" often names a permission grouping. If the current claim is permission or access standing, use the status, policy, or deontic governing pattern. Do not describe it as `U.Role` unless the bounded context explicitly introduces a work-facing role value and the holder, assignment, method, and work claims are current.

### F.4:8 - Anti-Patterns and Repairs

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Role-description as assignment | A card says "the inspector is assigned" without holder, context, and window. | Use `A.2.1`; keep F.4 for description of the role value. |
| Role-description as capability proof | "ReviewerRole can verify formal models." | Put capability under `A.2.2`; F.4 may reference the requirement. |
| Role-description as method | A role description contains a procedure. | Move the procedure to method or method-description patterns. |
| Role-description as work evidence | A role card is cited as proof that review occurred. | Use `U.Work` and evidence-use patterns. |
| Episteme as role holder | A report, standard, dataset, theorem, dashboard, or publication is said to hold a role. | Recover evidence-use, source-use, standard-use, requirement-use, publication-use, status-use, or assurance-use relation. |
| Status-template fusion | A status, permission, or evidence standing is made a second kind of role description. | Use direct status-use, policy, or evidence patterns. |
| Slot position as role | "The subject role in this relation..." | Use `A.6.5` SlotKind and ValueKind wording. |
| Bridge by label | Same role-like label in two contexts is treated as one role. | Use `F.9` Bridge and `F.18` naming discipline. |

### F.4:9 - Consequences

**Benefits.**

- Role descriptions become short enough for practical use while preserving ontology.
- Part F naming and bridge patterns can rely on role descriptions without inheriting assignment, capability, method, work, evidence, or status claims.
- Episteme-use relations stay direct and do not become a parallel role ontology.
- Method and work checks can cite role descriptions without treating them as work evidence.

**Costs.**

- Former "role-or-status template" material must move to F.10, A.2.4, B.3, A.10, E.17, G.6, or direct use patterns.
- A stronger claim may require several neighboring patterns instead of one overloaded role card.
- Durable names require `F.18` when the role name is public, Core-facing, or cross-context.

### F.4:10 - SoTA-Echoing and Source-Use

| Practice line | What FPF takes | Practical implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Role modeling in organizations, access-control, safety, and method engineering separates role labels, assigned holders, permissions, responsibilities, and performed work. | F.4 keeps only the role-description episteme and sends assignment, permission, capability, method, and work to direct patterns. | A readable role description does not become an access policy, staffing record, or work log. |
| Modern context and interoperability practice treats local meanings as bounded and compares them by explicit mappings, not by shared labels. | F.4 role descriptions stay local to one bounded context; cross-context reuse goes through `F.9`. | Same label does not make the same role. |
| FPF episteme and publication ontology separates the described entity, description episteme, and publication form. | A role description is a description episteme about `U.Role`; a card or table may publish it. | Editing the publication is not automatically changing the role value or assignment relation. |
| FPF slot discipline separates relation positions from fillers. | "Role" in a relation-position phrase is repaired to SlotKind or ValueKind when no work-facing `U.Role` is current. | Slot names do not create role values. |

Current best-known pressure for this problem is not a larger universal role taxonomy. It is explicit separation of local role value, assignment, attributes or capability, permission or policy standing, performed work, and evidence or status use. RBAC, ABAC, zero-trust authorization, safety independence practice, method engineering, and FPF slot discipline all push in that direction, while F.4 keeps only the role-description episteme and hands the neighboring claims to direct patterns.

Currentness and reopen condition: reopen this pattern when `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.5`, `A.2.7`, `A.15`, `A.6.5`, `C.2.1`, `F.9`, `F.10`, `F.18`, or the accepted episteme-use and status-use discipline changes enough that role-description, holder admission, or non-role-use boundaries would be stated differently.

### F.4:11 - Relations

**Builds on.** `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.6.5`, `A.7`, `C.2.1`, `E.10.D2`, and `E.24`.

**Coordinates with.** `A.2.2`, `A.2.5`, `A.2.7`, `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, `F.9`, `F.10`, `F.14`, `F.15`, `F.18`, evidence-use, status-use, source-use, publication-use, requirement-use, and assurance patterns.

**Constrains.**

- `F.5` must name role descriptions after the described `U.Role`, bounded context, and local sense are recovered.
- `F.8` must decide durable role-name minting or reuse without turning status-use or episteme-use relations into role descriptions.
- `F.14` must treat bundles and separation-of-duties as role relation structure or neighboring role-description claims, not as hybrid role descriptions.
- `F.15` must check role-description single-role and non-role-use boundaries.

### F.4:12 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Question |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-F4-01` | Is exactly one described `U.Role` named? |
| `CC-F4-02` | Is exactly one `U.BoundedContext` named? |
| `CC-F4-03` | Is the description kept separate from the role value and any publication form? |
| `CC-F4-04` | Is the admitted holder kind system-like or acting-holon-like under the governing work or method pattern? |
| `CC-F4-05` | Are assignment claims sent to `A.2.1`? |
| `CC-F4-06` | Are capability claims sent to `A.2.2`? |
| `CC-F4-07` | Are method, plan, and work claims sent to `A.15` and neighboring patterns? |
| `CC-F4-08` | Are evidence, source, standard, requirement, publication, assurance, and status uses sent to direct episteme-use patterns? |
| `CC-F4-09` | Are relation-position "role" words sent to `A.6.5`? |
| `CC-F4-10` | Are durable or cross-context names sent to `F.18` and `F.9` when current? |
| `CC-F4-11` | Are open-world missing slots treated as unknown, not recovered, not asserted, or not current rather than false? |

### F.4:13 - Phrasebook

Prefer:

- "role-description episteme describing `ReviewerRole` in `PatternReview_2026`";
- "holder admission for `ReviewerRole` is governed by `A.2.1`";
- "capability requirement referenced by the role description";
- "method requirement referenced by the role description";
- "review report used as evidence for the claim";
- "standard used as requirement source";
- "relation position governed by SlotSpec discipline".

Avoid as live vocabulary:

- "evidence role" for an episteme;
- "status role" for a badge or status-use relation;
- "standard role" for a standard used as source;
- "holder" for a publication, report, standard, dataset, or theorem unless a direct pattern admits an acting holon holder;
- "role" for a SlotKind;
- "role description" for a method, capability, work record, access policy, or status-use relation.

### F.4:14 - Didactic Memory

A role description is the readable episteme that tells people what a role value means in a bounded context. It helps someone assign, check, name, or compare the role. It does not assign the role, prove capability, define the method, perform the work, grant permission, carry evidence, publish itself, or turn every useful episteme into a role holder.

### F.4:End
