## F.18 - Local‑First Unification Naming Protocol
*Status: normative (Part F, Unification Suite). Audience: engineer‑managers, lead architects, editors of FPF records and publications.*

### F.18:0 - Use this when

Use `F.18` when a name must become stable and reusable across one local context, a concept set, a bridge, or a durable FPF/publication vocabulary. Use it when the issue is not merely one overloaded local phrase, but a name that must carry context, kind, local sense, use-domain, bridge relation or F.9.1 bridge stance when live, and lineage without smuggling global sameness.

**First useful move.** Ask whether the live work is durable naming. If yes, make the name local-first by naming its context, kind, purpose/use-domain, local sense, and bridge relation or F.9.1 bridge stance when live. If no, use the lighter governing pattern: local phrase repair under `E.10` or `C.2.P`, relation precision under `A.6.P`, or the domain pattern that governs the named object.

**Cheap stop.** If the wording is one-off local repair and does not create a reusable name, stop after the local repair with recovered kind and use. Do not open a full Name Card, mint a new head, or create lineage entries just because a phrase was clarified.

### F.18:1 - Context

Names must carry enough signal for everyday use, yet never smuggle in Cross‑context identities, hidden assumptions, or role/metric clutter. F.18 supplies that naming discipline and weaves it through F.1–F.17: Term Harvesting, Sense Clustering, Role Descriptions, Concept‑Sets, Bridges, Lexical Continuity, Anti‑Explosion control, and the Unified Term Sheet (UTS).

**Scope.** This protocol applies to naming of **any concepts** authored in Part F (U.Types and **local concepts** alike: kinds, roles, services, methods, works, relations, characteristics, states/statuses, etc.). The **U.Types** norms in this section are a **specialization**, not a restriction of scope.

**Purpose of this pattern.** Provide a **human-legible, context-bound naming protocol** that:
* keeps *local meaning first* and prevents Cross‑context conflation;
* makes the **kind** of thing explicit (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Decision, Requirement, etc.);
* integrates smoothly with **Concept-Sets**, **`U.RoleDescription`**, and **Bridges** without requiring any special notation or tooling;
* records lineage actions (mint, reuse, align, deprecate, split/merge) with a paper trail that managers can audit.

### F.18:2 - Problem

Without a shared naming protocol inside Part F, the same recurrent failures appear:

1. **Global‑name illusion.** A short label travels from one context to another and is *assumed* to mean the same SenseCell or Concept-Set row; later, contradictions appear during acceptance or assurance.
2. **Context drift.** A label gradually changes inside its Context (edition, scope, envelope) without leaving a clean trace; readers argue over “what we meant.”
3. **Kind confusion.** Names hide *what sort of thing* is being named (System vs Episteme vs Role vs Service, etc.), leading to category errors and brittle integration.
4. **Threshold‑in‑the‑name.** Numeric limits, duty segregation, or state qualifiers get baked into names (“Critical‑Reviewer‑0.2 mm”), which cannot age or compose.
5. **Stealth renames.** Quiet label swaps, steered by fashion or politics, sever continuity with earlier evidence, plans, and bridges.
6. **Explosion by synonyms.** Teams mint many near‑synonyms instead of reusing a Concept‑Set row or creating an explicit Bridge with loss notes.

These failures erode trust, block reuse, and make Part F machinery (Concept-Sets, `U.RoleDescription`, Bridges) harder to apply.

### F.18:3 - Forces

| Force                                      | Tension to balance                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local truth vs Cross‑context portability**  | The name must “belong” inside one context while remaining referenceable from other contexts through explicit bridges.               |
| **Human ergonomics vs conceptual clarity** | Short, natural labels help teams move; explicit kind and Context cues keep reasoning sound.                                          |
| **Stability vs evolution**                 | Names should be durable, yet easy to deprecate or refine without breaking links to past evidence and work.                    |
| **Brevity vs auditability**                | A compact “badge” for everyday speech, plus an authoritative **Name Card** that records meaning, scope, edition, and lineage. |
| **Parsimony vs inclusivity**               | Reuse existing Concept‑Set rows where possible; mint new names only when indispensable in the local context.                     |

### F.18:4 - Solution — The Local‑First Naming Protocol

F.18 defines **eight rules** (R‑rules) and **six practices** (P‑practices). Together they produce **Name Cards** that any reader can interpret **ontologically** without guessing, and that slot cleanly into the rest of Part F.

**Path Card (subset of Name Card).** A **Name Card** whose named FPF value is an **EvidenceGraph Path**: it cites a **PathId** (or **PathSliceId**), **Context**, **ReferencePlane**, **Γ_time**, and any **Bridge id(s) + CL/CL^plane** (with loss notes). Used by **G.6** and **G.10** to make justifications portable on UTS.

#### F.18:4.1 - The Eight R‑rules (normative)

**R1 — Speak every name *with its Context*.**
A name is **never** context‑free. When you introduce or use a name, **pair it with the Bounded Context** where it lives (the “Context of meaning”), and with the **edition** of that Context if relevant. In everyday speech: “X, *in* Y.” Cross‑context use requires a Bridge; labels alone do not travel.

**R2 — State the ontological *Kind* on the Card.**
Every Name Card **must** state the **Kind** (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Objective, Requirement, Decision, Characteristic, etc.). This prevents category errors and keeps Role–Method–Work alignment clean. *Clarification:* this is a **Card requirement**, not a demand that the label string begin with the Kind. The Kind field uses an accepted FPF kind or an explicitly marked extension candidate; the Name Card does not itself create a `U.Kind`, `RelationKind`, `GateProfile`, `EvidenceKind`, MVPK face kind, or Bridge.

**R3 — Declare the *Purpose / use‑domain* on the Card.**
In addition to **Kind**, the Name Card **must** state the intended **Purpose / use‑domain** that situates the concept in practice and signals **which families of contexts** are expected to use it (e.g., mathematical formalism, engineering practice, computer science, systems management). This enables reconstruction of usage from the lexicon and reduces unintended scope drift. *Clarification:* this is a **Card field**; it does **not** require the label string to carry the purpose qualifier.

**R4 — Resolve the name to a *Local‑Sense*.**
A minted name must resolve to a Local-Sense inside its Context (the result of F.2–F.3). If a name points to a Role Description, state that template and its sense basis. Avoid heavily overloaded label words: when needed, prefer concise two-word Tech labels that hint at the intended sense.

**R5 — Use *Twin Registers* (Unified Tech + Plain).**
Provide two human‑oriented labels on the Name Card, per **E.10** register discipline:
* a **Unified Tech** label (short, morphology‑stable, neutral in wording);
* a **Plain** label (reader‑friendly phrasing for managers and subject‑matter experts).

The **Unified Tech** label is the only one used in **Core** normative prose; **Plain** is for teaching and examples. Both remain **context‑local**; neither establishes Cross‑context identity (that is the job of the **UTS row** and **Bridges**).

**R6 — Keep thresholds and states *out of the name*.**
Do not encode numeric limits, separation‑of‑duties, or readiness states in the label. Put thresholds on **Method steps** (capability/acceptance), states in **Role State Graphs**, and SoD via **incompatibility** relations. Names carry *what this is* and *which Context claims it*—not *when and how it may act*.

**R7 — Cross‑context only by *Bridge* with loss notes.**
When another Context needs to reference a name, use an **Alignment Bridge** that states the relation (equivalent, narrower, broader, analogous) and its **Congruence Level** with explicit **loss/fit** annotations. Never equate two names by label alone.

**R8 — Make renames and merges *first‑class events*.**
When a label changes, or two labels consolidate or split, record it on the Name Card as a lineage action (rename, merge, split, retire) with rationale and dates. Past uses *remain valid as historical facts*; continuity comes from lineage, not silent edits.

#### F.18:4.2 - The Six P‑practices (normative process)
**P1 — Candidate set (*NQD-front* of seed-words).**
Do **not** pick a label “in one shot”. Build a **small, non-dominated candidate set** (an *NQD-front*, typically 5–10 items) by seeding and varying along:
**Traditions** — mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, systems thinking, management, etc. with their typical contexts and situations; use maximum diversity here;
 **Novelty/Familiarity** — from careful **reuse** of established terms to sharper **neologisms** from recent SoTA traditions;
 **Lexical form** — distinct **head terms** and morpheme families, readability/pronounceability, inflection/declension, transparency.
Use the **Novelty–Quality–Diversity** discipline from **Part G** to maintain only **non-dominated** candidates; when appropriate, you may implement this via **Γ_nqd.generate**. Record the **seeds** and the short rationale in the Card’s notes. Choose final **Unified Tech**/**Plain** labels **from this frontier**; if a high-quality candidate is discarded, briefly note why.

For the purposes of **Diversity_P**, group candidates into **head-term families** (same base noun/verb + minor prepositions or case endings). Variants such as *“Reference plane”*, *“Plane of reference”* and *“Referred plane”* **count as one family**, not three distinct candidates. An NQD-front with multiple near-clones from one family **does not** satisfy the diversity requirement. Aim for **≥ 3 distinct head-term families** in the CandidateSet; if the front ends up with fewer families (e.g. due to a very narrow domain or high AliasRisk on other heads), the Name Card **MUST** record a brief rationale in the NQD-front notes.

**Lexical Q-components for the NQD-front**
When P1 uses **NQD-CAL (C.18)**, treat the **Quality vector** over candidates as part of the same archive as C.18’s **NQD-frontier**. Recommended components (all **ordinal; no arithmetic means**):

 * **SemanticFidelity (P — Ontological precision).**
  *Question.* Does the label verify against the **Minimal Definitional Statement (MDS)** and Concept‑Set row without adding or losing core invariants?
  *Scale (ordinal; ↑ better).* `{Misleading, Vague, Precise, Exact}` with `Exact ≻ Precise ≻ Vague ≻ Misleading`.
  *Link to P2.* When **P2** is run, derive the SemanticFidelity rating from the per‑sense‑seed judgements: candidates with any **core** sense‑seeds classified as `wrong‑prototype` **MUST** be rated **Misleading**; candidates rated **SemanticFidelity ≥ Precise** **SHOULD** have at least a configurable fraction `θ_P` (default `θ_P = 0.7`) of sense‑seeds in `on‑target` and **NONE** in `wrong‑prototype`. Discard candidates that remain **Misleading** after revision.

* **CognitiveErgonomics (S — Sociolinguistic admissibility).**
  *Question.* Can the target **RoleEnactors** (engineers, managers) read, pronounce, and recall the label without specialist training?
  *Scale (ordinal; ↑ better).* `{Alienating, Jargon, Acceptable, Natural}` with `Natural ≻ Acceptable ≻ Jargon ≻ Alienating`. Prefer labels **≥ Acceptable** in the stewardship Context.

* **MorphologicalActionFit (O — Morphological/action alignment).**
  *Question.* Does the morphology of the label hint at its role in **methods/morphisms** (object vs process vs result) and preserve the required derivational family (noun/verb/participial forms)?
  *Scale (ordinal; ↑ better).* `{Opaque, Role‑hinting, Action‑aligned}`. Action‑aligned labels make it obvious whether we are naming an **actor**, an **activity**, or a **publication result** (e.g., *ReviewerRole* vs *Reviewing* vs *ReviewRecord*).
  *Kind-sensitive cues.* When the **Kind** on the Card is a **Role**, prefer agentive/holder morphology (*…Role*, *…er*, *…or* or local equivalents); when the Kind is **Method or MethodDescription**, prefer verbal or gerundive forms; when the Kind is **Holon**, prefer result nouns, when **Work**, prefer verb. Misaligned morphology (e.g., a Role named with a pure process noun) should be treated as a **penalty on MorphologicalActionFit** and, if retained for legacy or regulatory reasons, called out explicitly in **Card notes**. See F.5/F.11/F.12 and **LEX-BUNDLE §8**.

* **AliasRisk (A — Lexical overload).**
  *Question.* How likely is a careful reader to import a **wrong sense** from neighbouring FPF records and publications or external canons when they see this string?
  *Scale (ordinal; ↓ better).* `{Safe, Context‑dependent, High‑Risk, Overloaded}` with `Safe ≻ Context‑dependent ≻ High‑Risk ≻ Overloaded`. Avoid adopting **Overloaded** labels unless required by legacy and called out explicitly in notes. When C.18’s **DomainDiversitySignature** is available, AliasRisk MAY be refined into a CHR‑typed characteristic with the same polarity.

Use these components for **Pareto comparison only** (per **C.16** ordinal discipline). Do **not** collapse them into a single scalar score; the NQD-front is computed over the **vector of lexical Q-components** together with **Novelty** and **Diversity_P**.

**P2 — Semantic read‑through against archetypal situations.**
Alongside the NQD‑front of label candidates, maintain a **small set of 5–10 archetypal situations** (“**sense‑seeds**”) that instantiate the intended use (purpose) across different traditions. For **each** candidate label and each sense‑seed, perform a **read‑through test**:
– write **1–2 short example sentences per sense‑seed** (e.g., “In case X, we perform \<Label\>”);
– classify the outcome, for a careful reader in the stewardship Context, as one of `{too-narrow, on-target, too-wide, wrong-prototype}`.
Maintain, on the Name Card, a small tally per candidate of how many sense-seeds fall into each class. Use these tallies both to **prune candidates** and to instantiate **SemanticFidelity** (P-component): labels with a sustained pattern of `wrong-prototype` hits on core sense-seeds **SHALL** be removed from the NQD-front (or kept only as deprecated aliases with an explicit warning). Candidates rated **SemanticFidelity ≥ Precise** **SHOULD** satisfy the `θ_P` constraint from the SemanticFidelity definition (fraction of `on-target` seeds) and have no `wrong-prototype` counts.
Record **rejected candidates** and their **mismatch patterns** in the Name Card’s **NQD‑front notes**.

**P3 — Mint‑or‑Reuse gate (F.8).**
Before minting, search your Context’s **Concept‑Set table**. If a row already covers your sense, reuse it and only add a **local label**. If not, propose a **new row** and capture the decision in a brief rationale.

**P4 — Concept‑Set linkage (F.7).**
Every Name Card **must** indicate its Concept‑Set row (or record “not applicable” for intentionally Context‑unique names). This is the handle for alignment and anti‑explosion control.

**P5 — UTS registration (F.17).**
Publish each Name Card to the **Unified Term Sheet** with Context, kind, twin labels, sense reference, edition, and lineage status. Keep the UTS the single, human-readable table of record.

**P6 — Lexical-continuity hygiene (F.13).**
Apply the same discipline to renames, splits, merges, and retirements; leave forward and backward pointers so readers can trace lexical continuity at a glance.

#### F.18:4.3 - Guarded-head note for locally risky labels
Some locally useful heads remain risky because they already carry different load-bearing readings in different admissible local texts. In such cases, authors may publish a **guarded-head note** as a thin naming-governance companion.

A guarded-head note does **not** create a new governing term, does **not** establish Cross-context sameness by itself, and does **not** replace the meaning fixed in the cited authority text, governing FPF pattern, or accepted `DRR`. It simply records that one publication-facing head should stay deconflicted while local-first naming continues to govern minting, reuse, aliases, and Bridges.

This is especially useful when one head already appears in more than one admissible local reading, such as `projection` in `A.16` move language and in `F.9.1` bridge stance language. The note should therefore name the consumer sites, keep each local reading explicit, and resist any temptation to flatten them into one global head.

#### F.18:4.3a - Durable-head settlement for entry/discoverability vocabulary

When naming work touches the discoverability amendment, `PCP-TERM` plus `F.18`
and `A.6.P` must settle the durable heads used here, including
`pattern-entry discoverability`, `description recognition signature`,
`entry orientation`, `entry lexeme retrieval aid`, `expanded entry-disambiguation case`,
`Problem-frame recognition signature`, and `thin-echo discipline`, as part of
the amendment itself.

The amendment should therefore assign each effect to one named FPF pattern,
pattern section, field, relation, or section of a named non-pattern FPF publication
form with an entry or retrieval-aid function. When such a non-pattern publication form is used,
its publication form, companion function, and reference must be named by value,
and the referenced section must carry that effect. Do not let the single trigger
word `discoverability` become one semantic swamp.

The canonical settlement table for this amendment is:

| Term | Canonical job | Receiving FPF pattern, pattern section, field, relation, or selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair | Plain-only or deprecated neighbors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pattern-entry discoverability` | composite entry quality over one entry-recognition stack | `E.11` | broad `discoverability` alone |
| `description recognition signature` | first-contact cue structure of one description-bearing unit | `A.6.RSIG` | `discoverability of descriptions` |
| `recognition text` | existing first reading text inside one pattern | `E.8` | invented `discoverability surface` |
| `FirstEntryPatternComparisonSet` | case-relative `E.11` entry-distribution grouping of plausible candidate patterns, tempting wrong patterns, entry-load reclassifications, and admissible entry stops | `E.11`; use `I.2` for expanded entry-disambiguation cases when compact cues are insufficient | `route`, `semanticArea` as navigation label, `ontologicalNeighborhood` as navigation label |
| `entry lexeme retrieval aid` | lexical and query retrieval aid without alias minting | `F.17`, `F.18`, and `E.10`, coordinated by `E.11` | `lexical discoverability`, bare search-help wording |
| `ExpandedEntryDisambiguationCase` | bounded case that expands compact first-entry comparison when wrong-pattern risk, repeated failure, retrieval-facing use, or compact guidance insufficiency is live | `I.2` | `workflow`, `scenario script`, `route`, untyped interpretation label |
| `thin echo` | low-detail projection pointer to the cited pattern, cited pattern section, field, relation, or section of a named non-pattern FPF publication form; the pointer makes the publication form, companion function, and reference recoverable, and the referenced section carries the claim | `E.11` | duplicated guidance, parallel blurbs |

One canonical term per job is the settled target of this amendment.
Rejected or superseded wording is not live Plain or Tech vocabulary; the row uses the selected name.

#### F.18:4.3b - EntityOfConcern family naming settlement

When naming work touches the C.2.1 EntityOfConcern family, use these rows as the local-first settlement. They are Name Card settlements for field and head names; they do not create a new `U.*` kind, relation kind, evidence kind, publication kind, or universal entity ontology.

`EntityOfConcern` is the selected Tech head for the Russian idea "интересуемая сущность" in the episteme slot/ref and same-EntityOfConcern alignment family. It means the entity, relation, claim record, or kind named by value/reference pair selected for the declared use by role-method-interest selection, construction/reference trace, episteme trace when a Description episteme or Description episteme admitted for specification use is live, publication-unit trace when a bounded unit is live, bridge or retargeting trace when sameness crosses context, and witness trace when work, action, or reliance is live. If that trace is missing, the result is a candidate set, blocked use, or non-use, not a stronger claim under a nicer name.

| Name or source wording | F.18 settlement | Must not mean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EntityOfConcern` | Preferred Tech head for the EntityOfConcern, relation, claim record, or kind named by value/reference pair that a claim-bearing episteme, pattern body, or bounded publication unit treats as primary for the declared use. | A universal `object`, a topic by interest alone, the publication unit itself, or a new kernel kind. |
| `EntityOfConcernSlot` | Entity-valued C.2.1 slot. Relation, claim-record, and kind named by value/reference cases enter only through the declared relation/claim/reference discriminator and the governing pattern. | A relation-valued bucket, a generic claim-use bucket, or a way to avoid the relation named by value, evidence, gate, work, decision, assurance, or architecture pattern. |
| `entityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernRef` | Reference handle for the EntityOfConcern under the slot/ref discipline of C.2.1. Same-EntityOfConcern cases preserve this reference; retargeting changes it only through A.6.4 and its invariant/loss boundary. | A free publication-unit field, title, topic, carrier reference, authoring-work reference, or review-object reference. |
| `EntityOfConcernClass` | Constraint on admissible EntityOfConcern values only where an episteme slot or same-EntityOfConcern law is live. | A topic taxonomy, audience category, object-quality class, or default pattern-family partition. |
| `publicationUnitPrimaryEntityOfConcern` | Technical head for the primary entity of concern, non-claim-bearing kind named by value, topic, or subject that one bounded `PublicationUnit` is mainly about while carrying one move and one outside-work boundary. When a claim-bearing episteme or episteme-lane `U.View` is live, recover it through `EntityOfConcernRef`. | A C.2.1 slot by itself, a second EntityOfConcern ontology, a carrier identity, a title, or project-side authority by readable form. |
| `EntityOfInterest`, `EoIClass`, `DescribedEntity*`, `describedEntityRef`, `primary described entity` | Use `EntityOfConcern`, `EntityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernClass`, `publicationUnitPrimaryEntityOfConcern`, or the local FPF kind named by value. | Live technical vocabulary, second C.2.1 slot family, alias permission, or permission to keep old semantics beside the selected family. |
| `EntityOfConcernAlignmentCase` | Local table head for the same-by-value, retarget, bridge, relation-record, distinct-entity, and blocked-use split. | A new kernel kind or a substitute for A.6.4, F.9/F.17/F.18, A.6.P, or the pattern governing the relation kind. |

#### F.18:5.1 - Card purpose & mode guard (normative)

To prevent “post-hoc justification” of intuitively chosen labels, every **Name Card** SHALL declare its
**CardMode ∈ {MintNew, DocumentLegacy}**:

* **MintNew.** The Card is the **output of an NQD-style lexical search** over a **candidate label set** generated inside
  the stewardship Context(s), using the lexical Q-tuple `{SemanticFidelity, CognitiveErgonomics, MorphologicalActionFit,
  AliasRisk}` together with **Novelty (N)** and **Diversity_P** (per A.0 / C.17–C.18 / B.5.2.1).
  – The Card SHALL record:
    – a minimal **CandidateSet** (the labels actually evaluated), with **head-term family** tags for each candidate;
    – the resulting **NQD-front** of **non-dominated candidates** over ⟨Q-tuple, N, Diversity_P⟩;
    – the **sense-seeds** used for P2 read-through and their mismatch patterns;
    – a short **selection note** explaining why the chosen Tech/Plain pair was picked from that front
      (e.g., “better CognitiveErgonomics at equal SemanticFidelity”).

  – A single-element NQD-front is permitted only if the Card records a brief rationale why **no alternative candidate
    survived** the lexical and NQD filters (e.g., legacy constraints, high AliasRisk on all other options).
  – A MintNew card is **non-conformant** if authors fill only the top fields after choosing a label by intuition.
    Recording the chosen label, Kind, and a short rationale is **not** a substitute for the seed set, NQD-front,
    sense-seed read-through, and explicit non-dominated selection.

* **DocumentLegacy.** The Card documents an **externally imposed legacy label** (e.g., a regulatory or de facto Standard)
  and its mapping to FPF structures. In this mode the Card MAY omit a full NQD-front, but SHALL:
  – state the **legacy source and provenance**;
  – either (i) provide at least a **sketched NQD-comparison** of viable internal variants against the legacy label, or
    (ii) record a short **out-of-scope rationale** (e.g., “name frozen by law; see cited Standard”) explaining why NQD
    search is not being used for selection.

For all **Core-facing naming of U.Types and other canonical FPF concepts**, **MintNew** is the **default** CardMode; using
DocumentLegacy for such names requires an explicit justification on the Card.

For one-off local phrase repair, no Name Card mode is live. Use `E.10`, `C.2.P`, or `E.17.AUD.LHR`, and record the repaired phrase only where the local repair pattern requires it. Open a Name Card only when the repair mints or changes one durable reusable name, UTS row, Core-facing term, or cross-context naming relation.

A **Name Card** is the authoritative, human‑readable record of a name inside its Context. It has these fields; teams may add local notes.

1. **Row ID** — the stable, opaque **UTS row identifier** (the row identity handle).
2. **Twin labels** — **Unified Tech** and **Plain** (per E.10).
3. **Context of meaning** — the Bounded Context and, if relevant, its edition.
4. **Kind** — what sort of thing this is (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Objective, Requirement, Decision, Characteristic, etc.). This is an **ontological category**, not a spelling prefix.
5. **Purpose / use‑domain** — the intended area(s) of use (which families of contexts are expected to use it).
6. **Minimal Definitional Statement (MDS)** — one-paragraph intended sense in the stewardship context (no tool/process slang).
7. **Didactic subtitle** — ≤ 12 words that signal pragmatic use.
8. **Sense reference** — a Local‑Sense reference (how F.2–F.3 clustered it).
9. **Concept‑Set linkage** — Concept‑Set reference or “not applicable” (with rationale).
10. **Alignment note** — if a Bridge exists to other Contexts, cite it and record **loss/fit** in plain words (no formulas required on the Card).
11. **Relation kind** — if the name is for a relation, declare **structural** vs **epistemic** and `validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, inferential, postulate}`. For **structural** relations, provide **Constructive** grounding (`tv:groundedBy → Γₘ.sum|set|slice`). If the name is not for a relation with arity ≥ 2, set this field to “n/a”.
12. **Manager’s clip** — one‑line “use/avoid” guidance for everyday communication.
13. **Archetypal situations (sense‑seeds)** — **5-10 short “X‑case” lines** used by **P2** for the semantic read‑through; keep them **edition‑aware** and **context‑local**. For **MintNew** cards these are required evidence, not optional examples.
14. **NQD‑front notes** — brief rationale for discarded candidates (**include mismatch patterns from P2, the head-term family mix, and any lexical Q‑scores used in P1**).
15. **SemanticFidelity/CognitiveErgonomics/MorphologicalActionFit/AliasRisk** scores for the NQD-front labels, recorded at least ordinally for the surviving candidates.
16. **Version**  — current status and history of editions.
17. **Card notes** — optional free text with comments about the name (e.g., recommended translations, etymology, pronunciation).

**Manager’s reading habit.** When two names collide in a meeting, ask for their **Context**, **Kind**, **Purpose/use-domain**, and **Sense reference**. If any of those differ, you are comparing different things; switch to **Bridge** talk, not label talk.

### F.18:6 - What *belongs* in the label—and what does not

**Belongs (keeps the label clean and durable):**

* The **core head word** that names the thing *(the **Kind** is recorded on the Card; the string need not encode it)* (e.g., “Pump”, “Standard”, “Requirement”, “Surgeon”, “Cooling”).
* A **purpose qualifier** if it is essential to the local sense and stable across editions (e.g., “Cooling” vs “Fuel”).
* A **scope qualifier** only if it is part of the *meaning* rather than the current plan (“Surgical Ward” rather than dates or batch numbers).

**Does not belong (move elsewhere):**

* **Numbers and thresholds** (put on steps, capabilities, acceptance clauses).
* **States** (use Role State Graphs and checklists).
* **Temporal windows** (work plans and history).
* **Organisational authorisations** (speech acts and assignments).
* **Imported acronyms** from other Contexts (use Bridges with loss notes instead).

**Quick litmus for authors.** If removing a number, date, or state *does not* change the *meaning* of the thing, it should **not** be in the label.

### F.18:7 - Worked triad (three short, context‑local examples)

*(Names below are illustrative; the same words in other Contexts may mean something else. The point is how the Name Card keeps them clear.)*

#### F.18:7.1 - Industrial operations Context: “Thermal Management - 2026”

* **Kind:** Service
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** industrial thermal utilities; line‑level planning and operations
* **Unified Tech label:** Cooling Supply
* **Plain label:** Chilled water for line B
* **Sense reference:** supply of water at defined temperature/flow to boundary B
* **Concept‑Set:** “Utility service” row; local variant recorded
* **Alignment note:** Bridge to “Plant Utilities - 2026” notes that “Cooling Supply” there bundles filtration; *loss:* filtration is not guaranteed in this Context
* **Version:** 20 Feb 2024
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):** *Cooling Supply*, *Chilled Water Service*, *Process Cooling*, *Cooling Utility*. **Chosen:** *Cooling Supply* (neutral, morphology‑stable).

**Why it’s good.** The label doesn’t encode temperature or flow limits (those live in acceptance). It names a Service; nobody will confuse it with a pump System or a Method.

#### F.18:7.2 - Clinical Context: “Hospital OR - 2026”

* **Kind:** Role
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** OR governance and staffing; credentialing and checklists
* **Unified Tech label:** Surgeon Role
* **Plain label:** Operating surgeon
* **Sense reference:** person who is authorised to perform surgical steps under defined checks
* **Concept‑Set:** “Clinical roles” row
* **Alignment note:** Bridge to “Training & Credentialing - 2026” shows partial overlap; *loss:* that Context’s “Senior Surgeon” carries teaching duties that do not apply here
* **Version:** Feb 2025; renamed‑from “Lead Surgeon” (2025) with rationale: avoided “lead” vs “operating” ambiguity
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):** *Surgeon Role*, *Operating Surgeon*, *Primary Surgeon*, *Operating Physician*. **Chosen:** *Surgeon Role* (Kind‑neutral string; Plain clarifies).
*Lexical Q snapshot (PSOA‑style, informative).*

| Candidate | SF | CE | OA | A‑Risk | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Surgeon Role | Precise | Acceptable | Role‑hinting | Safe | Neutral head noun; morphology matches **Role** Kind; works across departments. |
| Operating Surgeon | Precise | Natural | Role‑hinting | Context‑dependent | Reads well, but “operating” competes with “operating theatre/room”; kept as Plain label only. |
| Primary Surgeon | Vague | Natural | Role‑hinting | Context‑dependent | “Primary” ambiguous (training vs shift); rejected for governance vocabulary. |
| Operating Physician | Vague | Jargon | Role‑hinting | High‑Risk | Collides with non‑surgical physician roles; rejected despite familiarity in some hospitals. |

**Why it’s good.** No fatigue thresholds or readiness states in the name; those live in the Role’s state graph and checklists.

#### F.18:7.3 - Public service Context: “Civic Services - 2026”

* **Kind:** Requirement
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** service performance management; public service SLAs
* **Unified Tech label:** Passport Lead‑Time
* **Plain label:** Time to issue a passport
* **Sense reference:** elapsed time from complete application to issuance
* **Concept‑Set:** “Service quality requirements” row
* **Alignment note:** Bridge to “Legal Framework - 2026” records that legal “deadline” has different remedies; *loss:* legal exemptions not carried into this Context
* **Version:** current
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):** *Passport Lead‑Time*, *Issuance Time*, *Service Turnaround*, *Time to Issue Passport*. **Chosen:** *Passport Lead‑Time* (neutral; Plain remains didactic).

**Why it’s good.** Target values (e.g., ≤ 20 days) are not in the label; they live in acceptance clauses.

### F.18:8 - Conformance Checklist (editor aid) — *Part I: naming & cards* (**non‑normative**)

**CCE‑F18.1 (Context pairing).**
Every name used in normative text **must** be paired with its **Context of meaning**. If you cannot name the Context, you do not have a valid name.

**CCE‑F18.2 (Kind clarity).**
Every Name Card **must** state the **kind** (System, Episteme, Role, Service, Method, Work, Objective, Requirement, Decision, Characteristic, …). Using labels that hide kind is non‑conformant.

**CCE‑F18.2a (Purpose declared).**
Every Name Card **must** state the **Purpose / use‑domain** (families of contexts where the concept is expected to be used). Omitting Purpose is non‑conformant.

**CCE-F18.3 (Sense reference).**
A minted name **must** resolve to a **Local‑Sense** in its Context. If a sense cannot be stated, label minting is deferred.

**CCE‑F18.4 (Twin registers).**
Each Name Card carries a **Unified Tech** and a **Plain** label (E.10). Tech appears in **Core** prose; Plain in teaching/examples.

**CCE‑F18.5 (No thresholds/states in labels).**
Numeric limits, readiness states, and separation‑of‑duties **must not** appear in labels. Put them on steps, checklists, and role algebra.

**CCE‑F18.6 (Bridge‑only travel).**
Cross‑context reuse of a name **must** go through an **Alignment Bridge** with an explicit relation and **loss/fit** notes. Label matching alone is forbidden.

**CCE‑F18.7 (Lexical-continuity visibility).**
Renames, splits, merges, and retirements **must** be recorded on the Name Card with dates, rationale, and forward and backward lexical-continuity pointers. Past occurrences remain valid as historical facts.

**CCE‑F18.8 (Mint‑or‑Reuse gate).**
Before minting, authors **must** check the Context’s Concept‑Set table; if a row exists, **reuse** it with a local label unless a documented reason compels a new row.

**CCE‑F18.9 (UTS entry).**
Names used in normative FPF publications **must** appear on the **Unified Term Sheet** with the specified **Name‑Card fields**; include Notes when present).

**CCE‑F18.10 (No cross‑kind labels).**
Do not reuse the same **Unified Tech label** for different kinds inside one context (e.g., “Cooling” as a Service and as a Method). If unavoidable, add a stable qualifier to disambiguate and record the decision on both Name Cards.

**CCE‑F18.11 (Manager’s clip).**
Each Name Card **should** carry a one‑line “use/avoid” note to guide everyday speech. Where omitted, editors add it during review.

**CCE‑F18.12 (Anti‑explosion check).**
If three or more near‑synonyms for the same Local‑Sense appear in drafts, authors **must** either consolidate to one label or record an intentional synonym pair with use/avoid notes and a plan to converge.

### F.18:9 - Normative Standard (what must be true)

> This section is binding. It specifies the publication Standard for unification-oriented names in the Unification Suite (Part F), with **local-first authority**, **bounded context clarity**, and **one-way unification** through declared dependency strata. It complements, and does not replace, the structural and epistemic Standards elsewhere in FPF.

**9.1 Local authority & stewardship context.**
Every unification name has a **single stewardship Bounded Context**: exactly one *Bounded Context* that authors and stewards it. That stewardship Context is responsible for the definition, examples, and lineage of the name. Cross-context reuse happens by **bridges**, not by relocating the stewardship Context.

**9.2 Minimum definitional payload.**
A published name MUST ship with a human-readable **Minimal Definitional Statement (MDS)** that states the intended sense in the stewardship context, and a **Didactic Subtitle** (≤ 12 words) that signals its pragmatic use. The MDS must be free of process slang and implementation jargon.

**9.3 Row ID plus labels.**
For each adopted name, the stewardship Context supplies:
* a **Row ID** (the opaque UTS identifier — the **row identity handle**), and
* two **labels**: a **Unified Tech** label (for Core prose) and a **Plain** label (for teaching).
  Both labels refer to the same underlying sense; **Plain** may simplify terms, not premises.

**9.4 One-way dependency strata.**
Each dependency stratum depends only on already-admitted lower strata: a name in stratum *n* can rely on names admitted in strata ≤ *n*, never sideways or upwards. Cycles are prohibited. If a dependency is not yet admitted at the required stratum, the new name remains Draft or Pilot.

**9.5 Local‑first before reuse.**
Teams MUST first **identify and stabilize the local sense** (within their Bounded Context). **Within the stewardship Context**, reuse existing **Concept-Set rows** where they fit (§4.2 **P1**). **Across contexts**, reuse occurs via **Alignment Bridges** that map the local sense to an existing sense elsewhere without collapsing the local stewardship Context.

**9.6 Sense, not string.**
Publication concerns **sense** (intended meaning in context), not the literal string. Synonyms are allowed as **Plain** labels or **aliases** only if they point to the same **Row ID** and pass the conformance checks in §15 (“CC‑F18”). Strings must not be treated as identity.

**9.7 Relation-kind discipline (structural vs epistemic).**
If the public name expresses a **structural relation**, its intended sense **MUST** be backed by *exactly one Constructive trace* in the structural calculus (Compose-CAL) and **SHALL** declare `validationMode=axiomatic` (see E.14). If the name expresses an **epistemic relation**, Constructive backing is optional; **declare** `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}` and use **Logical/Mapping** and/or **Empirical Validation** as appropriate. **Do not mix relation kinds** inside a single name. *(Do not use “Tier-1/2”; formality is expressed via F per C.2.3.)*

**9.8 Member vs Component.**
Names that describe collection membership MUST NOT be used to imply part‑whole structure, and vice versa. If both aspects are needed, publish two names with their own MDS and an explicit bridge.

**9.9 Name-lineage states.**
A name travels through **Idea → Draft → Pilot → Ratified → Deprecated**. Transitions require explicit human review gates. Ratified names carry a clear stewardship contact and date.

**9.10 Anti‑duplication duty.**
Before ratification, the stewardship Context MUST perform a **near-neighbor review**: identify adjacent names, record the decision to align, merge, or keep separate, and publish the rationale in the name’s record.

**9.11 Local clarity over global neatness.**
When in doubt, prefer **local intelligibility** for practitioners over global symmetry. Global neatness can be achieved later via bridges; loss of local sense is hard to repair.

**9.12 No imported tool terms in Core names.**
Names and their MDS must not carry terms whose only meaning is tied to operating tools or pipelines. If such terms are unavoidable in pedagogy, confine them to Working-Names and examples with disclaimers.

**9.13 Human‑only conformance.**
Conformance for this protocol is judged by trained human reviewers using the author and reviewer checklists in §14 and the conformance criteria in §15 (“CC‑F18”). Automated heuristics, if any exist in an organization, have no standing in the Core.

### F.18:10 - Rationale (why this exists and why these rules)

**10.1 Local‑first unlocks velocity without lexical debt.**
Centralized naming regimes seem tidy but slow learning and create brittle compromises. Local‑first minting lets teams speak clearly **now**; unification comes from disciplined bridges and one‑way dependencies, not from premature centralization.

**10.2 One stewardship context lowers ambiguity.**
Names with several competing stewardship contexts drift. A **single stewardship Context** concentrates accountability for sense, examples, and lineage, while still enabling broad reuse via alignment bridges.

**10.3 Unified Tech + Plain serve two audiences.**
Engineers need **precise** wording; managers and stakeholders need **approachable** wording. Splitting the labels keeps the same sense while protecting accuracy and pedagogy; both are keyed by the **Row ID**.

**10.4 One-way dependency strata prevent conceptual knots.**
Acyclic dependencies cut off circular definitions and policy deadlocks. Dependency strata provide a simple mental model: build on what is already firm.

**10.5 Relation-kind discipline prevents category errors.**
Part-whole claims **(structural)** must rest on **Constructive** grounds (`tv:groundedBy → Γₘ.sum|set|slice`, `validationMode=axiomatic`). Experience-based or evaluative relations **(epistemic)** follow assurance rules (**Logical/Mapping**, and **Empirical Validation** when *postulate*), with an explicit `validationMode ∈ {inferential, postulate}`. Mixing relation kinds inside a single name confuses review and invites hidden assumptions.

**10.6 Sense over string reduces false conflicts.**
Disputes often orbit the string (“we hate that word”). By separating **sense** (what we mean) from **string** (how we say it), the protocol enables peaceful coexistence: keep the **Row ID** constant; use one **Plain** label and, where helpful, a budgeted **alias** per register.

### F.18:11 - Application Guidance (how to apply, step by step)

**11.1 Prepare (30–60 min).**

* Clarify **your Bounded Context** and audience.
* Collect 2–3 typical user stories that require the name.
* Scan near‑neighbors in adjacent contexts (see §14.2 Reviewer checklist).

**11.2 Mint locally.**

* Write the **MDS** in plain language, one paragraph.
* Draft a **Didactic Subtitle** (≤ 12 words): “what this name buys you.”
* Decide whether the intended **relation kind** is **structural** or **epistemic** (do not mix), and declare `validationMode`.

**11.3 Choose labels.**

* **Unified Tech label**: concise, morphology‑stable, neutral; avoid metaphor.
* **Plain label**: approachable phrasing for non‑specialists.
* **How to choose**: pick both **from a small NQD‑frontier** (see §4.2 P1 (candidate set), P2(read-through)): diversify by tradition, novelty/familiarity, and lexical form; record discarded contenders and rationale on the Card.

**11.4 Place in the dependency stratum.**

* Verify all dependencies are at the same dependency stratum or below.
* If a dependency is still Draft/Pilot, keep this name at most Pilot.

**11.5 Align, don’t erase.**

* Where overlap exists with another context, propose an **alignment bridge**.
* Keep your stewardship Context; record the mapping and any known divergence in reading.

**11.5a Test the replacement candidate against umbrella drift.**

* Before replacing an overloaded head, apply the `E.10:0.2` replacement-candidate anti-umbrella rule. Then run the candidate head through the same local-first naming test: primary `EntityOfConcern`, receiving FPF pattern, carried admissible move, kind named by value/ref or local field, relation or claim record when live, neighboring exclusions, and example fit.
* Do not approve a candidate merely because it avoids the old bad word. The replacement is acceptable only when the FPF kind named by value or local field is defined by value and the current use names its boundaries.
* If the candidate still hides several possible kinds, keep a candidate-set note and do not mint, rename, or land the term yet.

**11.5b Keep interpretive-view labels subordinate to the base candidate set or family.**

* When a naming pass talks about one palette, front, archive, shortlist, or candidate set, keep that base candidate set or family recoverable on the Name Card.
* Use thinner interpretive-view wording when the pressure is local comparison across candidate labels, sense-seeds, rejected candidates, or guarded-head notes.
* Use atlas wording only when the naming explanation truly depends on several declared views, spaces, mappings, or distortion qualifiers being visible together, for example one cited `OutcomeMapRef` plus a `BridgeDistortionNote`.
* Those cited spaces or qualifiers stay naming-side reuse of already-declared substrate qualifiers; they do not let naming passages mint one new source-to-outcome relation or one new publication-use relation locally.
* A guarded-head note remains naming governance: it can explain why one head word misleads across admissible readings, but it does not decide substrate stewardship or publication policy.

**11.6 Publish and steward.**

* Publish the name with MDS, subtitle, dependency stratum, stewardship contact, examples.
* Schedule a **first refresh**: when should the stewardship Context examine usage and drift?

**11.7 Deprecate gracefully.**

* If the sense is superseded, publish **Deprecation Notes**: what to use instead, and why. Keep old Working-Names visible long enough to allow safe migration.

**11.8 The “Friday test.”**

* On a busy Friday, could a competent colleague apply the name correctly using only the MDS, subtitle, and two examples? If not, refine before ratification: it is too overloaded with meanings to be helpful.

### F.18:12 - Examples (worked mini‑cases for engineer‑managers)

> These examples are deliberately simple. They show how local-first minting, one-way unification, and dependency-stratum discipline operate together.

**12.1 “Module” vs “Component” (engineering structure).**

* *Stewardship Context A (Platform)* mints **Component** with MDS: “A physically or logically integrated part whose removal would alter the integrity of the whole.” **Structural**.
* *Stewardship Context B (App Team)* mints **Module** with MDS: “A deployable bundle of functionality maintained as a unit.” **Epistemic** (usage practice), not a structural claim.
* **Unification:** An alignment bridge states: “In Platform, every Component may include one or more Modules; Modules are not Parts.” Dependencies are one-way: *Module* depends on *Component*; *Component* does not depend on *Module*. No synonymy asserted. Both names remain in their stewardship Contexts.

**12.2 “Incident” vs “Event” (operational sense).**

* *Stewardship Context C (Operations)* mints **Incident** with MDS: “An unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of a service.” **Epistemic**.
* *Stewardship Context D (Monitoring)* mints **Event** with MDS: “A recorded observation of a state change in a system.” **Epistemic**.
* **Unification:** Bridge notes: “Some Events are Incidents when they degrade service; not all Events are Incidents.” **Plain** labels (and at most one alias per register) may vary (e.g., “Outage” as an alias for **Incident**), but the **Row IDs** stay distinct. No part‑whole claims are implied.

**12.3 “Customer” vs “Account Holder” (business roles).**

* *Stewardship Context E (Sales)* mints **Customer**: “A party that receives value from an offering in exchange for consideration.” **Epistemic**.
* *Stewardship Context F (Finance)* mints **Account Holder**: “A party legally responsible for an account.” **Epistemic**.
* **Unification:** Bridge states overlaps and divergence: “A Customer can be an Account Holder; an Account Holder may not be a Customer (e.g., trustee).” The stewardship Contexts retain stewardship; a shared Working-Name “Client” may be used in executive materials with a clear note: **Working-Name only; see Concept-IDs for decisions**.

**12.4 “Batch” vs “Lot” (collection vs integration).**

* *Stewardship Context G (Manufacturing)* mints **Batch**: “A collection of items produced under shared conditions.” **Epistemic membership**.
* *Stewardship Context H (Quality)* mints **Lot**: “An integrated whole packaged and tracked as one item.” **Structural whole**.
* **Unification:** Bridge notes: “A **Lot** may originate from a single **Batch** or a slice of a Batch; not every Batch yields a single Lot.” Relation mapping: **MemberOf** (Batch membership) vs **ComponentOf**/**Whole** (Lot integration). *Loss note:* membership evidence does **not** imply part‑whole structure; part‑whole structure does **not** imply shared production conditions.

**12.5 “Palette label” vs “Atlas label” (NQD/OEE naming-side interpretation).**

* A naming pass compares candidate labels over one active palette and shortlist. The card keeps the active palette recoverable and uses thinner interpretive-view wording, because the question is only which label best fits the current candidate spread.
* Later, the same naming discussion must explain why one label misleads unless the reader can see the palette together with a derived archive, an `OutcomeMapRef`, and one `BridgeDistortionNote`. In that case atlas wording is allowed, but the card still names the base palette and records that the atlas is only optional interpretive help for the naming explanation.
* In both cases, guarded-head notes stay on the naming side: they explain alias risk or mismatch patterns, not who stewards the substrate or which publication face is authoritative.

### F.18:13 - Anti‑Patterns & Failure Modes (what to avoid)

**13.1 “Global name first.”**
Trying to coin a single global string before local understanding is mature. **Fix:** mint locally, publish MDS, then align.

**13.2 “Synonym storm.”**
Collecting many strings without stabilizing the Concept-ID. **Fix:** one Concept-ID per sense; multiple Working-Names only if they truly help didactics.

**13.3 “Process leakage into names.”**
Burying workflow or tool steps inside the MDS. **Fix:** keep process in method descriptions; keep names about sense, not procedure.

**13.4 “Member‑implies‑part.”**
Letting collection names induce part‑whole claims. **Fix:** separate names, separate MDS; don’t smuggle structure into membership.

**13.5 “Sideways dependency.”**
Defining a name by appealing to another Draft at the same dependency stratum or higher. **Fix:** depend only downward or postpone ratification.

**13.6 “Alias/Plain drift.”**
Letting a Plain label or alias accumulate extra meanings absent in the underlying row. **Fix:** periodic label review; prune metaphors that start bending sense; respect the alias budget.

**13.7 “Atlas label does substrate work.”**
Letting atlas or interpretive-view language quietly replace the base candidate set or family or decide substrate stewardship or publication policy. **Fix:** keep the base palette, front, archive, or shortlist recoverable, use atlas wording only when several declared views or qualifiers are jointly load-bearing for the naming explanation, and move substrate questions and publication questions to the pattern sections that govern those objects.

### F.18:14 - Assurance & Conformance (human‑only checks)

#### F.18:14.1 - Author checklist (before requesting review).

* [ ] I identified the **stewardship Bounded Context** and audience.
* [ ] I wrote a clear **MDS** (≤ 1 paragraph) and a **Didactic Subtitle** (≤ 12 words).
* [ ] I declared the **relation kind** (structural vs epistemic) and the **validationMode**; no mixing.
* [ ] If **structural**, I can point to **exactly one Constructive trace** that backs the structural claim.
* [ ] I surveyed near‑neighbors and recorded my decision to align, merge, or keep separate.
* [ ] I produced both **Unified Tech** and **Plain** labels (per E.10), with the same sense and pointing to the same **Row ID**.
* [ ] Dependencies point **only downward**; no sideways or upward pulls.
* [ ] If I used interpretive-view or atlas wording, the Name Card still names the base palette, front, archive, shortlist, or candidate set and states why thinner interpretive wording did or did not suffice.
* [ ] I scheduled a **refresh date** and listed 2–3 usage examples.

#### F.18:14.2 - Reviewer checklist (at the gate).**

* [ ] One stewardship Context is declared; stewardship contact is clear.
* [ ] The MDS is free from process jargon and implementation slang.
* [ ] The declared **relation kind** is justified; **structural** claims are constructively grounded; **epistemic** claims declare `validationMode` and evidence basis.
* [ ] Member vs Component is respected where relevant.
* [ ] Alignment bridges are proposed where overlap exists, with explicit reading of convergence/divergence.
* [ ] The dependency-stratum discipline holds: acyclic, downward-only dependencies.
* [ ] The **Plain** label does not smuggle extra commitments; **Unified Tech** and **Plain** remain co‑referential and point to the same **Row ID**.
* [ ] Interpretive-view or atlas wording, if present, leaves the base candidate set or family recoverable and does not smuggle substrate or publication decisions into a naming note.
* [ ] Name-lineage state is accurate (Idea, Draft, Pilot, Ratified, or Deprecated) and dated.

#### F.18:14.3 - Lightweight outcomes.**

* **Ratify** (meets all checks).
* **Pilot** (publish with explicit questions and a refresh date).
* **Revise** (return to author with targeted gaps).
* **Merge** (replace with an alignment to an existing name).
* **Deprecate** (publish successor guidance and sunset plan).

### F.18:15 - Conformance Criteria (normative “CC‑F18”)

> These are **language‑level** obligations for authors and reviewers. They ensure every unified name is **local‑first**, **bridge‑aware**, and **teachable**.

**CC‑F18‑1 (Context first).** Every unified name **SHALL** be grounded in **local senses** that were harvested and clustered **inside named Contexts** (“context of meaning”) prior to unification. No name may be minted from free‑floating glosses or Cross‑context intuition. Use F.1–F.3 first.

**CC‑F18‑2 (Bridge‑only sameness).** Claims of sameness across Contexts **SHALL** be expressed only via explicit **Bridges** with a stated congruence and loss note. Mere spelling similarity never licenses a unified name. Use F.9.

**CC‑F18‑3 (Twin‑register naming).** Each unified concept **SHALL** carry **two labels**—a **Unified Tech** label (used in Core prose) and a **Plain** label (used for teaching). Labels are chosen per the naming discipline of F.5 and the register rules of **E.10**.

**CC‑F18‑4 (Neutrality of the Tech label).** The **Unified Tech** label **SHALL NOT** be borrowed wholesale from any single source Context where that borrowing would re‑import that Context’s private distinctions. Prefer a **neutral** term; **Cross‑context reuse occurs only via the UTS row and explicit Bridges**. (See F.5 “allowed/forbidden forms”.)

**CC‑F18‑5 (One concept per row, one Tech label per row).** A unified concept **SHALL** be captured as **one Concept‑Set row** in the **UTS**. Exactly **one Unified Tech label** is normative for that row; additional deprecated strings are aliases in Annex (budgeted). Use F.7 with F.17.

**CC‑F18‑6 (SenseCell citations).** For each unified name, the **SenseCells** (Context × Local‑Sense) that justify it **SHALL** be cited in the UTS row with **Context name + edition**. Omit edition only if the Context has a single stable edition. See F.17 §6.

**CC‑F18‑7 (Sheet‑level coverage).** Within a thread’s UTS, the **set of rows** carrying unified names **SHALL** collectively cite **≥ 3 distinct Contexts**, ensuring breadth of evidence. Coverage is a property of the **sheet**, not of every single row. See F.17 §6 constraint.

**CC‑F18‑8 (No global words).** In Core text, **“Context” always means `U.BoundedContext`**; **discipline columns** may be used in teaching layouts but **is not** a bearer of meaning. Do not write context‑free claims of sameness. See E.10 and F.17 §5.

**CC‑F18‑9 (Didactic primacy).** A unified name **SHALL** be teachable on **one page**: its **UTS row** + a short narrative that a careful reader can replay (F.16 template). If it cannot be taught concisely, the naming attempt is premature.

**CC-F18-10 (No process-phase connotations).** Names **SHALL NOT** encode imagined “maturity stages” or time-ordering unless those are part of the concept meaning. Stages belong in **state-space** and dynamics narratives, not in names. (See A-series CHR patterns.)

**CC‑F18‑11 (Strict distinction guard).** Names **SHALL** respect **A.7 Strict Distinction**: do not collapse **Role ↔ Method ↔ Work** or **Status ↔ Description** into one word. Align with F.11/F.12 where relevant.

**CC‑F18‑12 (Change control via F.13).** Renames, splits, merges, and retirements **SHALL** follow F.13’s lexical continuity rules; the UTS remains the canonical public term sheet for these changes.

**CC-F18-13 (Lexical Pareto discipline).** When a Name Card uses **NQD-CAL (C.18)** to score label candidates, the **chosen Unified Tech label** **SHALL** lie on the **Pareto frontier** of the lexical Q-tuple `{SemanticFidelity, CognitiveErgonomics, MorphologicalActionFit, AliasRisk}` (per **C.16** ordinal discipline and P1’s NQD-front definition), unless an explicit exception is recorded. If authors deliberately select a dominated candidate (e.g., to honour legacy regulation or user muscle memory), the Name Card’s notes **MUST** state the reason for stepping off the frontier.

**CC-F18-14 (NQD-front recorded, with honest diversity).**
When a Name Card is in **MintNew** mode, the **candidate label set** and the resulting **NQD-front of non-dominated label candidates** over the lexical Q-tuple `{SemanticFidelity, CognitiveErgonomics, MorphologicalActionFit, AliasRisk}` **SHALL** be explicitly recorded on the Card (at least as a small table or list), together with the NQD evidence hooks (`DescriptorMapRef`, `DistanceDefRef`, and a brief `Diversity_P` / coverage summary).
Each candidate **SHALL** carry a **head-term family** tag; morphological or prepositional variants built on the same head (e.g. “X plane”, “plane of X”, “planar X”) **MAY NOT** be counted as distinct for Diversity_P. The Card **SHALL** indicate how many distinct head-term families are represented on the NQD-front.
An NQD-front with fewer than **three** head-term families is permitted **only** if the Card records why no lexically more diverse alternatives survived the SemanticFidelity / AliasRisk filters (e.g., very narrow domain, frozen legacy idiom).

**CC-F18-15 (Selection from the front only).**
The **Unified Tech** and **Plain** labels published on the UTS row for a unified concept **SHALL** be drawn from the currently recorded **NQD-front** on the Name Card. Publishing a Tech/Plain pair that is **not** on that front (or that is dominated with respect to the declared lexical Q-components plus NQD) is **non-conformant**, except in explicit **DocumentLegacy** mode as defined in §5.1.

**CC-F18-16 (Mode declaration).**
Every Name Card **SHALL** declare its `CardMode ∈ {MintNew, DocumentLegacy}`. For Core-facing naming of **U.Types** and other canonical FPF concepts, **MintNew** is the default; **DocumentLegacy** is permitted only when recording pre-existing external names and MUST (i) cite the legacy source, and (ii) either attach an NQD-front over viable FPF variants or record a short rationale why NQD search is out-of-scope. Ordinary local phrase repair has no Name Card mode unless it mints or changes one durable reusable name, UTS row, Core-facing term, or cross-context naming relation.

**CC-F18-17 (Procedure is not optional in MintNew mode).**
A **MintNew** Name Card is **non-conformant** if it records only the chosen label, Kind, and a short rationale while omitting the seed candidate set, the NQD-front, the sense-seed read-through, or the mismatch patterns that justify the final choice. A card filled in after an intuition-first label pick does **not** satisfy F.18.

**CC-F18-18 (Interpretive-view labels keep their base candidate set or family).**
When a Name Card or worked naming note uses interpretive-view or atlas wording, it **SHALL** keep the base palette, front, archive, shortlist, or candidate set recoverable, **SHALL** use atlas wording only when several declared views, spaces, mappings, or qualifiers are jointly load-bearing for the naming explanation, and **SHALL NOT** let guarded-head notes stand in for substrate stewardship or publication policy decisions.

#### F.18:16.1 - Canonical semantic unpacking for “contract” language (normative; used across FPF)

In FPF, everyday “contract” talk is treated as shorthand for a bundle of distinct roles. When precision matters (architecture, audit, compliance), authors **SHALL** avoid mapping “contract” to a single concept and instead disambiguate at least:

* **Service / promise clause (`U.PromiseContent`)** — the promised external effect + acceptance criteria (a spec/Standard), not a run (`U.Work`).
* **Utterance (`U.SpeechAct`)** — the published statement (a Description) that declares or invokes the promise content.
* **Commitment (`U.Commitment`)** — the deontic bond that binds an accountable `U.Agent` or `U.Role` to the promise content.
* **Work & evidence (`U.Work` + carriers)** — the actual enactment and the traces/metrics used to adjudicate fulfilment.

A “contract” bundle typically spans the whole A.6.B square; assign each piece explicitly to its A.6.B value:

* `L-*`: definitions/invariants of the signature (“what it means”).
* `A-*`: admissibility/entry predicates (“when it can be applied”).
* `D-*`: duties/SLAs/penalties and who is accountable (“who is bound to what”).
* `E-*`: evidence/observability claims (“how fulfilment/violation is adjudicated”).

Example 2 (§F.18:18.2) shows one naming instantiation of this unpacking.

### F.18:17 - Migration notes (renames, splits, merges, retirements)

**M1 — Start from Contexts, not from the old global word.** When inheriting legacy names, first **re‑harvest** terms inside the chosen Contexts (F.2–F.3). Only then decide whether to **reuse** or **mint** (F.8).

**M2 — Preserve reader muscle memory without duplicating meaning.** Keep the **Plain** label close to familiar speech, but make the **Tech** label precise. If a legacy term is overloaded, publish it as a **deprecated alias** in Annexes, not as a second Tech label. (F.13; Part H “Deprecated Aliases”.)

**M3 — Prefer split‑then‑bridge over vague merges.** If one legacy word covers two distinct concepts, **split** into two rows and add a short **relation note** between them (e.g., “recipe vs run”). Do **not** hide the split under a wide new name. (F.7; F.16.)

**M4 — Keep identifiers stable; move rows between blocks.** When the **Block Plan** evolves, move rows rather than renumbering; record the move in the row’s **Notes** field. (F.17 §16.)

**M5 — Upgrade rationale quality with worked examples.** Every rename or split should be accompanied by a **one‑page example** that shows the new row in action across at least **two Contexts**. (F.16; “tell‑show‑show”.)

### F.18:18 - Worked examples (compact)

> Each example shows **how the Protocol steers naming** so engineers and managers can communicate without hidden Cross‑context leaks.
> **Card hygiene shown explicitly:** each example **states the Kind and the Purpose/use‑domain** and **chooses Tech/Plain labels from a small NQD‑frontier** (seed set diversified by traditions, novelty/familiarity, and lexical form; see Part G patterns).
> **Head-term diversity:** each example **MUST** also state the **distinct head-term families** represented in its NQD candidate set (lexical “roots” such as *Recipe*, *Run*, *Episode*, not prepositional/morphological variants). This prevents faking Diversity_P with near-clones of one head.

#### F.18:18.1 - Example 1 — *MethodDescription* vs *Work* (recipe vs run)

* **Context harvest:**
  *BPMN 2.0 (2011):* “Process model” (recipe) and “Activity instance” (run).
  *PROV‑O (2013):* `prov:Plan` vs `prov:Activity`.
  *ITIL:* “Work instruction” vs “Change implementation record.”
* **Kind:** `U.MethodDescription` (design‑time record) **and** `U.Work` (run‑time occurrence).
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** planning/scheduling vocabulary across BPMN, PROV‑O, ITIL; separates *design recipe* from *execution episode* for governance and telemetry.
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):**
  *design‑time:* *Procedure*, *ProcessModel*, *MethodSpec*, *WorkflowDefinition*, *Recipe*, *MethodScript*
  *run‑time:* *Run*, *Execution*, *Enactment*, *ActivityInstance*, *Job*, *Episode*
* **Head-term families used (DesignRunTag):**
  *design-time heads:* {Procedure, ProcessModel, MethodSpec, WorkflowDefinition, Recipe, MethodScript}
  *run-time heads:* {Run, Execution, Enactment, ActivityInstance, Job, Episode}
* **Chosen from frontier (Unified Tech / Plain):**
  `U.MethodDescription` / “recipe”; `U.Work` / “run”.
  *Discarded highlights:* **Procedure** (collides with governance “procedure/policy”); **Execution** (overloaded in CS/security);
* **Anti-pattern (for illustration only, non-conformant).**
 > *Bad CandidateSet (lexically narrow):* {“Reference plane”, “Plane of reference”, “Planar reference”, “Ref. plane v2”}.
 > All four are one **head-term family** (*plane*). Even if Diversity_P over raw strings looks high (four labels), **head-term diversity is 1**, so this set **fails** the F.18 diversity intent. A conformant Card would either: (a) add labels with other heads (e.g., *Layer*, *Track*, *Band*), or (b) explicitly record why other heads are rejected (AliasRisk, domain idiom) and accept low lexical Diversity_P with a rationale.
* **Enactment** (speech‑act nuance).
* **Bridges:** recipe↔run **related**, not identical; loss note “control‑flow vs. execution.”
* **Why it matters:** Managers can schedule **Work** while authors improve the **MethodDescription**—no category errors. The NQD‑front preserves tradition‑diverse, lexically stable options until a reasoned choice is made. (F.11/F.16; F.17 rows.)

#### F.18:18.2 - Example 2 — *Service* (promise) vs *SpeechAct* (utterance) vs *Commitment* (deontic)

* **Context harvest:**
  *IT service canon:* “SLA/OLA clause”, “ticket approved”.
  *Speech‑act theory:* “performative utterance”.
  *Org governance:* “approval signature”.
* **Kind:** `U.PromiseContent` (promise), `U.SpeechAct` (utterance), `U.Commitment` (deontic bond).
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** ops/governance vocabulary connecting ITSM, organizational policy, and pragmatics; separates saying, binding, and promising.
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):**
  *promise:* *Service*, *Offering*, *Provision*, *CapabilityOffer*
  *utterance:* *SpeechAct*, *Performative*, *Utterance*, *Declaration*
  *deontic bond:* *Commitment*, *Obligation*, *Binding*, *Duty*
* **Chosen from frontier (Unified Tech / Plain):**
  `U.PromiseContent` / “service (promise)”; `U.SpeechAct` / “utterance”; `U.Commitment` / “commitment”.
  *Discarded highlights:* **Offering** (business‑model connotations); **Declaration** (too narrow for performatives); **Obligation** (legalese; narrower than commitment envelope).
* **Ontology note (informative):**
  `U.SpeechAct` and `U.Commitment` are defined normatively in Part A (A.2.9 and A.2.8 respectively). This F.18 card is a lexical/NQD reference, not the ontology definition site.

* **Bridges:** utterance **institutes** commitment; commitment **binds** promise content; no synonymy claimed.
* **Why it matters:** Status tracking becomes intelligible without pretending that a “service” acts; the NQD‑front yields neutral, cross‑tradition readable labels. (F.12; F.17 blocks D/R.)

#### F.18:18.3 - Example 3 — *Characteristic* names without process-phase bias

* **Context harvest:**
  *Quality canon:* “maturity level”; *Performance canon:* “throughput”.
 **Kind:** `U.Characteristic` (measurement names).
* **Purpose / use‑domain:** CHR‑compatible measurements for planning and performance; bridgeable across engineering and management.
* **NQD‑front (seed candidates):**
  *readiness (ordinal):* *MaturityLevel*, *ReadinessLevel*, *PhaseReadiness*, *TRL*, *ReadinessScore*
  *throughput (ratio):* *Throughput*, *Rate*, *ProcessingRate*, *OpsPerSecond*, *FlowRate*
* **Chosen from frontier (Unified Tech / Plain):**
  `U.ReadinessLevel` / “readiness level” (ordinal); `U.Throughput` / “throughput” (ratio).
  *Discarded highlights:* **TRL** (tied to a specific scale/tradition); **Rate/OpsPerSecond** (over‑specific units baked in).
* **Narrative:** Dynamics are shown as **movement in state-space**, not via process-phase-laden names such as “pre-production process”.
* **Why it matters:** Prevents process phase/time from leaking into labels; the NQD-front ensures neutrality and recognizability. (A-series CHR rationale; F.17 §4-§6.)

### F.18:19 - FAQ (authoring hygiene)

**Q1. How many Contexts must a naming proposal cite?**
**A.** The **sheet** for a thread should cite **≥ 3** distinct Contexts overall; an individual row may cite fewer if the concept appears in fewer Contexts. The point is breadth at the **UTS** level, not token‑stuffing rows. (F.17 §6 constraint.)

**Q2. Can a Source Context’s term ever become the Tech label?**
**A.** Only if its form is **already neutral** and does **not** smuggle in that Context’s private commitments. When in doubt, pick a fresh neutral Tech label and keep the Source term in **SenseCells**. (F.5.)

**Q3. Where do we put discipline‑vantage views like “Operations” vs “Research”?**
**A.** Use the **discipline columns** in a teaching layout if helpful, but remember: **discipline columns are not Context columns** and carry no editions. (F.17 §5.)

**Q4. How do we keep names stable while the story evolves?**
**A.** Keep **row ids** stable; evolve placement via the **Block Plan** and record moves in **Notes**. Use F.13 for renames/splits/merges. (F.17 §16; F.13.)

**Q5. What if two teams insist on different Tech labels for the same concept?**
**A.** Publish **one** Tech label; treat the other as a **deprecated alias** (Annex). Bridge their local senses on the row. (F.13; Part H.)

### F.18:20 - 90‑second teaching script (for engineer‑managers)

> “**Local‑first** means we start in **context of meaning**—we harvest terms **inside** each Context and only then unify. A unified name is a **teachable promise**: one **Tech** label for precision, one **Plain** label for outreach. Its **row** in the **UTS** shows where the idea lives in real disciplines (the **SenseCells**) and how those Contexts connect (explicit **Bridges** with a brief loss note). We never equate terms by spelling; we argue sameness with a **bridge**. We also never bake stages or actors into names—those belong to **dynamics** and **roles**, not labels. When the story changes, we evolve names with **lexical continuity** rather than re‑inventing words. The result is a vocabulary managers and engineers can **hold on one page** and use the same way across projects.”

### F.18:21 - Acceptance Harness (SCR/RSCR) for F.18

**Purpose.** Provide auditable, notation‑independent checks that a proposed unified name (and its publication on a UTS line) satisfies the **local‑first** unification discipline. The harness extends the general unification checks in **F.15** with **naming‑specific** obligations.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **RSCR‑U‑E01 (Edition drift).** When a source Context updates, re‑validate the row: stable sense ⇒ **rename/alias**; changed sense ⇒ **split/merge** rows; never overwrite. | Preserves truthfulness without erasing history. **F.13** RSCR.         |        |

| **RSCR‑U‑E03 (Alias creep).** Periodically prune aliases to the **≤ 1** budget per register.                                                                             | Maintains narratively crisp UTS. **F.13** RSCR‑Alias.                  |        |

### F.18:22 - Migration & Deprecation Notes (informative, naming‑specific)

1. **Start from rows, not strings.** When consolidating legacy labels, **build or revisit the Concept‑Set row** first; only then pick the **Unified Tech/Plain** names. This keeps **meaning** primary. **(F.7, F.17)**
2. **Prefer alias over merge.** If the *sense* is stable but the label misleads, **rename and retain one alias**; if the sense changed, **mint a new row** (no retrofits). **(F.13)**
3. **Resist modifier types.** New adjectives (e.g., *Peak*, *Remote*, *Night*) usually belong to **windows** or **examples**, not to the unified name. **(F.10/F.12/F.14)**
4. **Keep neutrality visible.** If stakeholders push a brand‑coloured label, document why the chosen **Unified Tech** is **neutral** and include the brand as an **alias** in Glossary/Annex. **(F.5, F.17)**
5. **Don’t globalise a Context.** Never move a Context label into the unified name as if it were universal. Use **Bridges** to relate Contexts, with an explicit **loss note**. **(F.0.1, F.9)**

### F.18:23 - FAQ (authoring hygiene for engineer‑managers)

**Q1. Can we reuse a dominant industry term as the Unified Tech name?**
**A.** Only if the row’s Concept‑Set shows **exact identity** across Contexts; otherwise pick a **neutral** Unified Tech and list the industry label as an **alias** in the Glossary. **(F.5, F.17)**

**Q2. Two terms look identical across Contexts—may we skip Bridges?**
**A.** No. **Sameness is argued, not spelled.** Publish a **Bridge** with relation kind and **CL** plus a short **loss/fit** note. **(F.9, F.0.1)**

**Q3. When do we mint a new U.Type vs. add a new row vs. add an alias?**
**A.** Use **F.8 Mint‑or‑Reuse**: if the *concept meaning* changes, **new U.Type**; if cross-context alignment needs a new Context, **new row**; if only the label misleads, **alias/rename**.

**Q4. Our team keeps proposing “qualified roles” (e.g., *Night‑Operator*). What do we do?**
**A.** Keep the **Role** unified and express qualifiers as **windows** on **Statuses** or as **example context**. This follows **F.14** and **F.12**.

**Q5. Can we compress two near‑equivalent rows into one to “simplify the sheet”?**
**A.** Only if the **one-breath rationale** remains true after review and the Bridges preserve equivalence with the same CL, or a higher CL only when new witnesses justify it; otherwise keep **two rows** with explicit differences. **(F.17, F.9)**

### F.18:24 - Didactic distillation (90‑second script)

> **“Name on a row, never on a whim.”** In FPF we **speak on rows, not on vibes**: a **Name Card** ties each Tech/Plain pair to a concrete Context, Concept‑Set row, and SenseCells, with a small **NQD‑front** of rejected alternatives. This gives you **bridged precision** without losing **local comfort**. **Your UTS is the one page a careful mind can hold.**

### F.18:24a - Name-card guardrails for set-candidate language

- Keep `Palette`, `Front`, `Archive`, and `Shortlist` as distinct head families rather than as aliases of one generic `portfolio`.
- Prefer this head family when the local entry load matches it:
  - `TraditionPalette` when `SubjectKind=Tradition`
  - `Q-Front`
  - `ExplorationArchive`
  - `Shortlist`
- The shortlisted family stays internally coherent:
  - `RankedShortlist ⊑ Shortlist`
  - `ShortlistId` is one `Id` specialized to an emitted shortlist
  - `ChoiceSet` may appear only as one mathematical gloss for the shortlist's set object, not as one rival public head
- Reserve `Pareto` for actual non-domination under a declared `DominanceSet`; do not use it for weighted ranking, popularity ordering, or one post-lens shortlist.
- Treat bare `portfolio` as a guarded reject here because current `FPF` already uses `portfolio` as one broader selector/set-return family. When the local set family is recoverable, do not reuse that broader head as the local winner.
- Treat bare `shortlist` as admissible only when the selected-set family is intended and the declared source set kind plus the named lens are already recoverable nearby.
- When one set-family candidate is tied to traditions, methods, hypotheses, or environment-method pairs, say the `SubjectKind` explicitly instead of letting the head noun do the work by implication.
- When one shortlist is emitted from one front or one archive, say the declared source set kind and the named lens instead of letting `Shortlist` drift into one generic selector result.
- If one local explanation still needs `ChoiceSet`, say that it is the mathematical set gloss for the shortlist rather than letting it read like one second public set family.
- Good examples include `TraditionPalette` for a tradition-member palette, `Palette + SubjectKind=MethodFamily`, `Q-Front`, `ExplorationArchive`, `ShortlistFromQFront`, `RankedShortlistFromShortlist`, and `ShortlistId`.
- Bad examples include bare `portfolio`, `SoTA portfolio`, `Pareto shortlist`, `Pareto archive`, and `frontier set` when the declared dominance basis is still missing.

### F.18:25 - SoTA-Echoing (post-2015 practice alignment)

F.18 is local-first, kind-bound, and context-bound naming discipline. Its SoTA source-use material must not make ordinary naming look mathematically certified. Mathematical and search traditions are admitted only when they make the Name Card more reviewable for the current naming problem.

* **Terminology work, especially ISO 704:2022 and ISO 1087:2019.** This is the direct practice basis for term formation, designation, definition, and concept discipline. F.18 adopts the requirement that a reusable name must keep its kind, context, intended use, and definition recoverable, while rejecting dictionary substitution and global vocabulary rows as sufficient naming work.
* **Word-sense disambiguation and sense evaluation.** P2's sense-seed read-through is a human-scale analogy: test a candidate name against several intended-use situations and record error patterns. WSD does not prove that a Name Card must use `theta_P`, sense-seed thresholds, or any particular numeric cut-off. Those remain FPF authoring choices that are admissible only when they improve local reviewability.
* **Quality-diversity and multi-objective search, including MAP-Elites and NSGA-II families.** P1's NQD-front and **CC-F18-13** adapt the design-space lesson: keep several diverse good candidates visible instead of collapsing too early to one scalar winner. This does not validate lexical candidate selection by itself. Pareto or frontier wording is admissible only when the lexical Q-components are explicit, inspectable, and used under the ordinal discipline of C.16.
* **Design-space exploration and idea ranking in mechanical and industrial design.** Name-Card candidate tables may borrow the habit of comparing alternatives on several visible criteria. The practical gain is auditability of rejected candidates, not a claim that naming has become an engineering optimization problem.
* **Semantic transparency and morphology in interfaces and code.** These traditions provide source-use material for readable labels and error prevention where comprehension is live. F.18 adapts them into MorphologicalActionFit and local head-term checks, while rejecting readability as proof that the name is ontologically correct.

### F.18:26 - Relations

**Builds on:**
**F.0.1** Contextual Lexicon Principles (local meaning; bridge‑only Cross‑context claims). **F.1–F.3** Contexts → term harvesting → local sense clustering. **F.5** Naming discipline. **F.7** Concept‑Set construction. **F.8** Mint‑or‑Reuse decision lattice. **F.13** Lexical continuity (renames/aliases/splits/merges). **F.14** Anti‑explosion controls (bundles, SoD, windows). **F.15** SCR/RSCR harness. **F.17** UTS as the public term sheet.

**Constrains:**
All patterns that propose or consume unified names and rows in Part F; any Part A/C pattern that cites U.Types on UTS rows inherits these naming duties (through the UTS linkage), while keeping **structural/epistemic/temporal** aspects distinct per Part E authoring rules.

**Coordinates with.**
**A.17/A.18** for measurement lexicon when rows concern measurable notions (Characteristic/Scale/Level/Coordinate vocabulary), ensuring neutral naming aligns with canonical terms and eases external alignment via Bridges.
