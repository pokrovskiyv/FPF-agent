## A.2.3 - `U.PromiseContent` (Promise Content)
> **Type:** Definitional promise-content episteme pattern
> **Status:** Stable

### A.2.3:0.1 - Kind Settlement

`U.PromiseContent` is a dependent durable promised-outcome episteme under the episteme settlement. It is not a root beside `U.Episteme`, not a commitment, not work, and not a carrier.

### A.2.3:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when a project needs to state what is promised to a consumer before asking who is obligated, what work was done, which system exposes access, or how evidence will judge fulfilment.

Typical moments:

- an SLA, service catalog, product offer, public API promise, utility offer, or government service description says what a consumer may rely on;
- a team says "the service" but might mean promise content, provider organization, API, access point, delivery system, method, ticket, or performed work;
- a promise must be judged by acceptance criteria against work evidence, without turning the promise clause into the work or the system.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** The EntityOfConcern is `U.PromiseContent`: a consumer-facing promise-content episteme that states promised outcome, access or eligibility, and acceptance criteria inside one bounded context.

**First useful move.** Write the promise content as a clause: what outcome is promised, who may use it, how access is described when relevant, and how fulfilment will be judged from work evidence. Then use `U.Commitment` only when an accountable subject is assigned to that content.

**What goes wrong if missed.** The word "service" starts naming provider, API, method, ticket, work, department, and promise at once. Teams then judge work against an implicit promise, treat access systems as obligations, or count performed work without knowing which promised outcome it was meant to satisfy.

**What this buys.** One consumer-facing promise-content episteme that can be linked to commitments, role assignments, access descriptions, work evidence, acceptance criteria, and outcome specs without collapsing those neighboring objects into one "service" bundle.

**Not this pattern when.** If the current EntityOfConcern is the accountable deontic relation, use `A.2.8`; if it is the performed delivery work, use `A.15.1`; if it is the access point or delivery system, use system and architecture patterns plus A.6.8 service wording repair; if it is contract-bundle unpacking, use `A.6.C`.

### A.2.3:1 - Problem frame

Across domains the word **service** is used for many different things: a server or **provider**, an **API**, a **procedure**, a **run**, a **department**, even a **product bundle**. Such polysemy is productive in everyday speech but toxic in a normative model.

FPF therefore reserves **`U.PromiseContent`** for one kernel meaning: a consumer-facing **promise content** clause. Any other “service” sense MUST be modeled explicitly as `U.System`, `U.RoleAssignment` or principal, `U.MethodDescription`, or `U.Work` inside an appropriate `U.BoundedContext` and, in normative prose, MUST be written with an explicit **facet head phrase** per **A.6.8 (RPR-SERV)**.

This keeps the kernel minimal while keeping the prose readable to non‑mathematicians: the canonical symbol is `U.PromiseContent`, and the head kind in normative text is always *promise content*.

**Modularity note.** A.2.3 defines only the promise-content object (the **promise content**) and its direct links to roles, access specification, acceptance criteria, and work evidence. The multi-facet "service situation" bundle that also names provider principals, systems, access points, commitments, and acts is handled as a precision-restoration lens in **A.6.8 (`serviceSituation(...)`)**. Contract-talk unpacking and classification of "contract", "SLA", and "guarantee" language is handled by **A.6.C**, which applies A.6.8 when service-cluster tokens appear.

In the Role–Method–Work alignment, the **promise content** must say something **external‑facing** and **consumer‑oriented**, yet remain separate from *how* the provider does it (Method or MethodDescription) and *what actually happened* (Work).

> Intuition: the **consumer-facing promise clause** is what you advertise and are judged by (`U.PromiseContent`); **work** is what you do to keep that promise; **method description or specification** is how you know what to do. (See A.6.8 for full "service" polysemy unpacking.)
> (Normative head-kind rewrite): a **promise content** is the promise clause you advertise and are judged by; **work** is what you do (and what can be evidenced) to satisfy that promise; **method description or specification** is how you know what to do.

**Lexical note (L-SERV and RPR-SERV)**

The lexical forms *service*, *service-level*, *service use*, and *service access* (and the adjacent cluster *service provider*, *server*) are **ambiguous** across domains. In the kernel, **`U.PromiseContent`** is reserved for the consumer-facing promised-outcome statement.

Normative prose therefore SHALL treat the bare head noun **service** as **always‑unpack** (PTG=Guarded): every head‑noun occurrence MUST be rewritten to a facet head phrase (promise content, service provider principal, service access point, service delivery system, and so on) or to the correct underlying EntityOfConcern or project-side FPF kind (team, ticket, endpoint host, procedure, work item), per **A.6.8 (RPR‑SERV)**.

E.10’s lexical trigger **L-SERV** SHOULD be implemented as “pointer + lint rule” to A.6.8: the short rule names the hazard, while A.6.8 provides the full rewrite recipe and the facet head phrase set.

### A.2.3:2 - Problem

Without a first‑class `U.PromiseContent`, models drift into five recurring errors:

1. **Provider = Service.** Calling the **system** or **team** “the service” collapses structure with promise.
2. **API = Service.** Treating an **interface or endpoint** as the service hides the consumer-oriented promise (effect plus acceptance).
3. **Process = Service.** Mapping a **procedure or Method** (or a WorkPlan) to "service" confuses recipe or schedule with the external commitment.
4. **Run = Service.** Logging **Work** as "a service" erases the standard and promise layer and breaks SLA reasoning.
5. **Business ontology lock‑in.** Large domain schemes (e.g., “business service” stacks) are imported wholesale, losing FPF’s universality and comparability across contexts.

### A.2.3:3 - Forces

| Force                                       | Tension                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **External promise vs internal capability** | Promise content must be consumer‑facing, while capability is provider‑internal.                               |
| **Specification vs execution**              | Promise content is a **specifiable** clause; value is **realised** only by runs of Work.                     |
| **Universality vs domain richness**         | One kernel meaning must cover IT, utilities, healthcare, public services—without absorbing domain taxonomies. |
| **Measurability vs privacy**                | Consumers need SLO, SLA, and outcomes; providers want implementation freedom (Method autonomy).                 |
| **Stability vs evolution**                  | Services version and change without invalidating prior Work evidence.                                         |

### A.2.3:4 - Solution — The unified concept `U.PromiseContent`

**Definition (normative).**
Within a `U.BoundedContext`, a **`U.PromiseContent`** is an **externally oriented promise clause**: a context-local statement of (i) a **promised external effect**, (ii) **eligibility and access** (how a consumer may request or use), and (iii) **acceptance criteria** (SLO-like or SLA-like targets) by which fulfillment is judged.

`U.PromiseContent` is **promise content** (`U.Episteme`), not a deontic commitment relation. One or more explicit **`U.Commitment`** objects (A.2.8) MAY reference a `U.PromiseContent` as payload for an accountable principal or role assignment; the clause itself does not "obligate" anyone until such a commitment is represented.

In normative prose, the head phrase for `U.PromiseContent` is **promise content** (or **service offering clause** or **service promise clause**) per A.6.8; the bare noun *service* is not a valid shorthand for this kernel object.

* **Type:** `U.Episteme` (a promise clause on a carrier).
* **Scope:** design‑time concept; judged at run‑time by evidence from `U.Work`.
* **Time stance:** design-time concept; judged at run-time by evidence from `U.Work`.
* **Orientation:** consumer‑facing (“what you can rely on”), as opposed to capability (“what we can do”).
* **Prose head (normative):** *promise content* (Tech), *service offering clause* (Plain; *service promise clause* acceptable synonym). Both twins retain an explicit **clause** head-kind to avoid act/content ambiguity and to comply with A.6.8 headword governance.

#### A.2.3:4.1 - Core structure (minimal fields)

```
U.PromiseContent {
  context        : U.BoundedContext,   // where the promise is meaningful
  purpose        : Text or Episteme, // the externally observable effect or value
  providerRole   : U.Role,             // role kind that may provide it (not a person or system)
  consumerRole?  : U.Role,             // optional role kind allowed to consume
  claimScope?    : U.ClaimScope,       // where the promise holds (G): operating conditions, populations, or locales
  accessSpec?    : U.MethodDescription,       // service access spec: request-facing interface and eligibility; not an access point system
  acceptanceSpec : U.Episteme,         // targets: SLO-like targets or acceptance targets such as quality, throughput, latency, or accuracy; evaluated over same evidence base as promisedOutcomeSpecRef (CC-A2.3-18)
  promisedOutcomeSpecRef : OutcomeSpecRef, // promised outcome (work, result, or both) in disambiguated spec form
  unitOfDelivery?: Episteme,           // how delivered units are counted or measured (unit + countingRule; see A.7:5.10)
  version?       : SemVer or Text,
  timespan?      : Interval
}
```

* `promisedOutcomeSpecRef` MUST point to a `U.OutcomeSpec` (A.7:5.10). It is the promise-facing outcome template (work-only, result-only, or composite), not a `U.Work` episode and not an extensional delivered-result referent.
* `providerRole` and `consumerRole` are **role kinds**; the actual performers are **RoleAssignments** at run‑time.
* `acceptanceSpec` defines **what counts as fulfilled** (the test).
* `accessSpec` is **how to ask** (eligibility, protocol, counter, desk, API).
* **Internal delivery methods and runbooks are not part of the promise content.** Model them as `U.MethodDescription` and relate them to the clause via `serviceSituation(...)` (A.6.8) or explicit context relations; providers retain **Method autonomy**.

#### A.2.3:4.1.1 - Promised outcome spec (disambiguation: work vs post-work result)

`promisedOutcomeSpecRef` points to an `U.OutcomeSpec` episteme that makes explicit **what is promised** in kind form and specification form without collapsing it into either:

* the **promise content clause** itself (`U.PromiseContent`),
* the **delivery work** that happens at run‑time (`U.Work`), or
* the **resulting state or object** after the work.

This is a controlled **semantic precision restoration** for the everyday metonymy "outcome" or "service outcome", which different communities use to mean (i) the work performed, (ii) the achieved result, or (iii) both.

**Terminology bridge (informative).**
In loose contract talk people say **promiseOutcomeSpec** (the description of what will be delivered) and **promiseOutcome** (what was actually delivered). Those lexical forms are metonymic: sometimes they mean “the work performed”, sometimes “the post‑work result”, and sometimes the pair.

In FPF:

* **promiseOutcomeSpec** → `U.OutcomeSpec` (A.7:5.10), referenced via `promisedOutcomeSpecRef`.
* **promiseOutcome** → an **extensional delivered outcome instance**. It is not a single kernel object; it is the **run‑time reality** that satisfies the outcome spec, understood according to `U.OutcomeSpec.mode`:

  * `WorkOnly` → the **set of delivery `U.Work` episode(s)** that satisfy `workSpec` (and, if present, the promised `methodConstraintRef`).
  * `ResultOnly` → the **post‑work state of the described referent(s)** on the declared `statePlaneRef` that satisfies `resultSpec.postConditionRef` (regardless of how it was achieved).
  * `Composite` → the pair: **(delivery Work episode(s), post‑work state)**.

  FPF points to this extensional delivered outcome instance by citing: (i) the relevant `U.Work` occurrence(s) and (ii) their **Delta anchors** (affected referents plus pre-state and post-state anchors) on the declared state-plane (A.15.1:4.2 item 10). Evidence carriers and telemetry are **epistemic witnesses** used to justify those anchors and acceptance verdicts - they are not themselves the delivered outcome.

If a Context needs an explicit handle for the delivered instance (e.g., for bundling, invoicing, or dispute cases), it MAY introduce a local kind such as `OutcomeInstance` with separate slots for: `{workRefs, affectedEntityRefs, postStateAnchors, evidenceRefs}`. Such a local reification MUST keep **(a) the extensional delivered instance**, **(b) the evidence about it**, and **(c) the outcome spec** (`U.OutcomeSpec`) distinct.

A conforming `U.OutcomeSpec` uses the canonical shape from A.7:5.10.2:

```
U.OutcomeSpec ::= {
  mode: WorkOnly | ResultOnly | Composite,

  workSpec?: {
    methodConstraintRef?: MethodDescriptionRef,   // optional: method is part of the promise (not “implementation detail”)
    workPredicateRef: EpistemeRef                 // predicate on `U.Work` facts and evidence
  },

  resultSpec?: {
    entityOfConcernRef?: EntityRef,               // what thing’s post‑state matters (may be kind‑labelled)
    statePlaneRef?: StatePlaneRef,                // where the predicate lives (A.7:3 pins)
    postConditionRef: EpistemeRef                 // predicate on post‑state (or evidence about it)
  }
}
```

* `workSpec` corresponds to the **work-as-promised** facet: it states the consumer-facing *kind* of work (optionally constraining method) and the work predicate (e.g., duration, method ban, safety limit).
* `resultSpec` corresponds to the **result-as-promised** facet: it states the post-work entity or state kind and the postcondition predicate.
* **Counting is not part of `U.OutcomeSpec`.** Counting lives on `U.PromiseContent.unitOfDelivery` as the `countingRule` mini‑schema (A.7:5.10.3). Outcome specs say *what* counts as delivery; unit‑of‑delivery specs say *how much* to count and how to avoid double counting.

**Examples (informative):**

* “Work 5 minutes” → `mode=WorkOnly`; `workPredicateRef` states duration ≥ 5 min; `methodConstraintRef` may be omitted.
* “Dig a hole” → `mode=ResultOnly`; `postConditionRef` describes the hole’s target state; method choice remains provider‑autonomous.
* “Hairstyle in ≤ 20 min, must be haircut+styling (not a wig)” → `mode=Composite`; `workSpec` expresses time + method constraint; `resultSpec` expresses the target hairstyle state.

**Naming note (normative).**
The head noun **outcome** is intentionally broad. Do **not** replace it with **result** when referring to the combined promise payload. If a passage means the **post-work entity or state only**, say **result** and link it to `resultSpec`. If it means the **work episode(s) promised**, say **work as promised** and link it to `workSpec`.

#### A.2.3:4.1.2 - Recommended `acceptanceSpec` mini‑schema *(informative, non‑kernel)*

`acceptanceSpec : U.Episteme` is intentionally open-ended in Core. However, to keep acceptance **computable** (and to avoid the older “pass verdict separate from delivery” mistake), Contexts are encouraged to express `acceptanceSpec` as a small bundle of references:

```
AcceptanceSpec (recommended) ::= {
  targetOutcomeSpecRef?: OutcomeSpecRef,  // default: SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef
  criteriaRefs: [EpistemeRef],            // each criterion evaluates the *delivery evidence base* (U.Work facts + Δ anchors + admissible Observations)
  verdictScale: Episteme or ScaleRef,        // pass, fail, or graded; MUST state how "non-delivery" is represented
  Γ_timePolicyRef?: EpistemeRef           // how Γ_time is selected (per‑Work, per calendar window, per batch, per population, …)
}
```

* **`targetOutcomeSpecRef`** makes explicit *which* promised outcome is being judged; if omitted, it is the containing promise content’s `promisedOutcomeSpecRef`.
* **`criteriaRefs`** are the acceptance criteria (SLO targets, quality gates, compliance predicates, etc.). Each criterion is an evaluation over the **same evidence base** used to establish delivery of the targeted `U.OutcomeSpec`: `U.Work` facts and evidence plus the relevant **Delta anchors** (affected referents plus pre-state and post-state anchors) on the declared state-plane, and any admissible `U.Observation` witnesses.
* **`verdictScale`** declares the decision scale (boolean, trichotomy, graded). It MUST define what happens when the outcome is **not delivered** (e.g., `fail`, `N/A`, `Inconclusive`, or a dedicated grade).
* **`Gamma_timePolicyRef`** keeps windowing explicit and non-retroactive (F.10 and F.12): it states whether judgement is per Work episode, per reporting window, per population, etc.

This mini-schema is a **recommendation only**: it is not a kernel object and may be flattened, encoded in a canonical SLO vocabulary, or carried in local contract records. Its purpose is to keep acceptance **discussable, auditable, and bridge-ready**.

#### A.2.3:4.2 - What `U.PromiseContent` is **not**

* **Not a provider:** use `System#ServiceProviderRole:Context` `U.RoleAssignment`.
* **Not a deontic commitment:** that is `U.Commitment` (A.2.8) referencing the promise content as payload.
* **Not an access point:** addressable "services", servers, desks, or endpoints are `U.System` (see A.6.8: *service access point* and *service delivery system*).
* **Not a method or recipe:** that is `U.Method` or `U.MethodDescription`.
* **Not a run, incident, or ticket:** that is `U.Work`.
* **Not a schedule:** that is `U.WorkPlan`.
* **Not a capability:** capability is **provider‑intrinsic ability**; service is **outward promise**. A service may **require** certain capabilities, but it **is not** the capability.
* **Not a scope label:** do **not** use *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, or *validity* as names for **scope objects**; declare **Claim scope (G)** or **Work scope** explicitly where needed (A.2.6).

#### A.2.3:4.3 - Position in the enactment chain

* **Design‑time:**
  The context **declares Claim scope (G)** for acceptance (operating conditions, populations, locales) per A.2.6.
  The context may assert: `bindsCapability(ServiceProviderRole, Capability)`.
  Providers choose `Method or MethodDescription` to realise the promised effect described by the promise content.

* **Run‑time:**
  A **consumer** performs `Work`, for example a request or visit - `performedBy: ConsumerRoleAssigning`.
  The **provider** performs `Work` to fulfil the promise content — `performedBy: ProviderRoleAssigning`.
  Delivered `Work` instances are evaluated against `acceptanceSpec`, **linked** to `promisedOutcomeSpecRef`, and **counted** via `unitOfDelivery`.
  SLA and SLO outcomes are therefore functions over **Work evidence**, not over the promise content object itself.

  (Terminology note: use `…RoleAssignment` consistently for the run‑time enactor relation; avoid the “RoleAssigning” variant unless it is a separately defined kind in the Context.)

> **Memory hook:** *Promise content states the promise, Method describes, Work occurs and is evidenced.*

#### A.2.3:4.4 - Didactic card: The service delivery chain (clause → commitment → situation → work → acceptance)

> **Didactic (non‑normative).** This is a one‑screen “map” that stitches the modular pieces together:
> `U.PromiseContent` (A.2.3) → `U.Commitment` (A.2.8) → provider `U.RoleAssignment` (A.2.1) → *serviceSituation(...)* facet slots (A.6.8 lens) → `U.Work + carriers` (A.15) → acceptance verdict (A.2.3).
>
> This is **not new ontology**. It is a reader‑safety diagram that prevents two common category errors:
> (i) treating `U.PromiseContent` as something addressable (“the service you call”), and
> (ii) treating `serviceSituation(...)` as semantics rather than a *facet-recovery lens* over already-defined kinds.

**Reading guide (one breath).**
* The **promise content** is the consumer-facing outcome and acceptance statement.
* The **commitment** names the accountable subject and it **references** the clause.
* The **provider role assignment** is the accountable subject *that can act* in a given Context and window.
* `serviceSituation(...)` (A.6.8) is a **facet-recovery lens** that names the common "service talk" participants (access spec, access point, delivery system, and delivery method) **without** collapsing them into the clause.
* **Work + evidence** is what happened; the **acceptance verdict** is computed by applying the clause’s `acceptanceSpec` to work evidence (not by reading the clause, and not by “looking at the service” as a system).

**Litmus rule (addressability).**
If you can call it, connect to it, visit it, restart it, or scale it, you are talking about a **service access point** (system facet), not the promised-outcome statement.

### A.2.3:5 - Archetypal grounding (engineer‑manager friendly)

| Domain                    | **`U.PromiseContent` (promise)**                           | Provider & Consumer (as Roles)                                   | Access (how to ask)                  | Fulfilment (Work)                        | Typical acceptance targets                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloud and IT**              | "**Object Storage**: durable PUT and GET of blobs up to 5 TB" | `CloudTeam#ServiceProviderRole`, `BackupJob#ServiceConsumerRole` | `S3_API_Spec_vX` (`MethodDescription`)      | Each PUT or GET run; data durability checks | Availability >= 99.9%, durability 11x9       |
| **Manufacturing Utility** | “**Compressed air** at 8 bar in Zone B”                   | `Maintenance#Provider`, `LineB#Consumer`                         | Manifold access rules (`AccessSpec`) | Compressor cycles & delivery logs        | Pressure window, purity class, flow ceiling |
| **Public Service**        | "**Passport issuance** within 20 days"                    | `Agency#Issuer`, `Citizen#Applicant`                             | Portal or desk SOP (`AccessSpec`)       | Case handling runs                       | Lead time <= 20 days, defect <= 1%            |

**Key takeaway:** the **same kernel object** models S3, a plant utility, and a government service: a **promise with access and acceptance**. Everything else (APIs, compressors, clerks, work sequences, tickets) is mapped via **Role, Method, and Work**.

### A.2.3:5.1 - Bias-Annotation

A.2.3 corrects service-bundle bias. A visible service name often bundles provider, access point, method, work, commitment, ticket, evidence, and promised outcome. The pattern recovers the promise-content episteme first, then links commitment, provider role assignment, access specification, work, evidence, acceptance, and outcome relations through their governing patterns.

It also corrects contract-form bias. A contract, SLA document, service catalog, API page, or public offer may publish promise content, but the publication carrier is not the promise-content episteme by itself and not the work that fulfils it.

### A.2.3:6 - Mapping the common “service” picture to FPF (didactic bridge)

The popular service diagrams (provider -> access -> use -> capability or activity) map to FPF as follows:

* **Service provider role assignment** → `System#ServiceProviderRole:Context` (`U.RoleAssignment`).
* **Service Level Objective (SLO) and acceptance targets** -> `U.PromiseContent.acceptanceSpec` (+ optional `WorkPlan` for windows).
* **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** (obligation-bearing source) -> `U.Commitment` referencing the relevant `U.PromiseContent` (and, where needed, its acceptance specs and evidence specs); use **A.6.C Contract Bundle** when packaging "the SLA" as a bundle of commitments, evidence specs, and publication carriers.
* **SLA document or published terms** -> `U.SpeechAct` (promise act or offer act) + the clause carrier (`U.Episteme`), per A.2.9 + A.7.
* **Operating conditions / “where the promise holds”** → `claimScope : U.ClaimScope (G)` (or embedded in `acceptanceSpec`) per A.2.6.
* **Subject of service ("customer material": asset, data, person, or case whose state is changed)** -> `promisedOutcomeSpecRef.resultSpec.entityOfConcernRef` (and the affected referents in delivery `U.Work.Delta`). "Ours vs theirs" (ownership or custody) is modeled as a **role or relationship inside the Context** (e.g., `OwnerRole:...`, `CustomerRole:...`, operated-by or owned-by), not as a Kernel-global property.

* **Service Presence and Access** -> `accessSpec : MethodDescription` (interface and eligibility); actual endpoints are **systems** playing interface roles.
* **Individual Service Use** → **consumer and provider `U.Work`** instances linked to the `U.PromiseContent` they fulfil.
* **Service-Enabled Capability or Activity** -> effects on the consumer side: either a **Capability** gained or used, or **Work** performed; do **not** reify as a new durable U-kind.

(Where a domain needs richer structures—catalogs, exposure layers, charging, entitlement—model them **in the domain context** and relate them to `U.PromiseContent` via `U.RoleAssignment` and alignment bridges.)

### A.2.3:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A2.3‑0 (Prose head phrase).**
In normative prose, an instance of `U.PromiseContent` SHALL be referred to as a **promise content** (or **service offering clause** or **service promise clause**) and SHALL NOT be referenced by the bare head noun *service*. Unqualified *service* usage (and the co-moving cluster *service provider* or *server*) SHALL be unpacked per A.6.8 (RPR-SERV).

**CC‑A2.3‑1 (Type).**
`U.PromiseContent` **IS** an `U.Episteme` (a consumer‑facing **promise content** on a carrier). It is **not** a `U.System`, **not** a `U.Method or U.MethodDescription`, **not** a `U.Work`, and **not** a `U.WorkPlan`.

**CC‑A2.3‑2 (Context).**
Every **promise content** **MUST** be declared **inside** a `U.BoundedContext`. Names and meaning are **local**; cross‑context reuse requires a Bridge (`U.Alignment`).

**CC-A2.3-3 (Role kinds, not people or systems).**
`providerRole` and (if used) `consumerRole` **MUST** be **role kinds** (see A.2). Actual performers at run‑time are `U.RoleAssignment`s.

**CC-A2.3-4 (Acceptance).**
`acceptanceSpec` **MUST** be present and **MUST** define how delivered `U.Work` is judged (pass, fail, or graded) against declared targets (SLO-style; any SLA deontics are represented via `U.Commitment`), and **MUST** declare **Claim scope (G)** where relevant (operating conditions, populations, locales). Every verdict cites an explicit **Gamma_time** window.
If the acceptance criteria mention measurable characteristics (availability, latency, accuracy, cost, safety, etc.), each such characteristic MUST be introduced via the Characterization patterns (C.16 and C.25): an explicit `U.Characteristic` (with scale and unit plus measurement procedure and evidence carrier), referenced by id rather than only by a bare KPI name.

**CC‑A2.3‑5 (Access).**
If consumers must request or obtain **service delivery work** through a request‑facing interface, `accessSpec` **MUST** reference the MethodDescription that defines eligibility and access-use rules (API, desk, or SOP). If the **service access point** is ambient (e.g., compressed air on a manifold), `accessSpec` **MAY** be omitted, but the eligibility condition **MUST** be stated in the Context.

**CC‑A2.3‑6 (Unit of delivery + counting rule).**
If performance is counted or charged, `unitOfDelivery` **SHOULD** be declared (e.g., "request", "kWh", "case").
When declared, `unitOfDelivery` **MUST** include a **countingRule** that maps accepted delivery work episodes (`W✓`) to unit counts (A.7:5.10). If omitted, the default is “1 unit per accepted delivery work episode”.

**CC‑A2.3‑7 (No actuals on Promise Content).**
Resource and time **actuals** and incident logs **MUST** attach to `U.Work` only (A.15.1). Promise contents carry no actuals.

**CC‑A2.3‑8 (Capability requirement).**
If the context requires provider abilities, it **MUST** express them as `bindsCapability(providerRole, Capability)` in the context, not by stuffing capabilities into the Service object.

**CC‑A2.3‑9 (Versioning & timespan).**
Promise contents **MAY** carry `version` and `timespan`. A `U.Work` that claims or fulfils a promise content **MUST** record which service-clause version it used.

**CC‑A2.3‑10 (Lexical rule).**
Unqualified head-noun uses of *service* (and the co-moving cluster *service provider* or *server*) in normative prose **MUST** be disambiguated per **A.6.8 (RPR-SERV)** and its lexical trigger **L-SERV** (E.10).

**CC‑A2.3‑11 (No mereology).**
Do **not** place a promise content clause in PBS or SBS, or treat it as a part or component. Structural assemblies live in PBS and SBS; the promise clause is an episteme (A.2.3) and "service" talk must be facet-unpacked (A.6.8).

**CC‑A2.3‑12 (Plan–run split).**
Windows and calendars belong to `U.WorkPlan` (A.15.2). Fulfilment evidence belongs to `U.Work` (A.15.1).

**CC-A2.3-13 (Scope lexicon & guards).**
Deprecated labels *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, and *validity* **MUST NOT** appear as names for scope objects in guards or conformance blocks. Use **`U.ClaimScope (G)`** for epistemes and **`U.WorkScope`** for capabilities (A.2.6 and A.2.2). Scope-sensitive guards **MUST** use **ScopeCoverage** with explicit **Gamma_time** selectors.

**CC-A2.3-14 (Bridges & CL).**
Cross-context mappings via Bridges keep **F** and **G** stable; **CL** penalties apply to **R**. A mapping **MAY** recommend **narrowing** the mapped **Claim scope (G)** as best practice (A.2.6 and B-line).

**CC-A2.3-15 (OutcomeSpec typing).**
`promisedOutcomeSpecRef` MUST resolve to `U.OutcomeSpec` (A.7:5.10). It MUST NOT be used to point at a concrete `U.Work` episode or at an extensional delivered-result referent.

**CC-A2.3-16 (OutcomeSpec is explicit and mode‑complete).**
`promisedOutcomeSpecRef` MUST be present and MUST reference an `U.OutcomeSpec` that declares `mode ∈ {WorkOnly, ResultOnly, Composite}` and satisfies A.7:5.10 mode completeness:
* `WorkOnly` → `workSpec` present, `resultSpec` absent
* `ResultOnly` → `resultSpec` present, `workSpec` absent
* `Composite` → both `workSpec` and `resultSpec` present

**CC-A2.3-17 (OutcomeSpec ⇄ Work anchoring).**
For any `U.Work` that `claimsPromiseContent(-, SC)` (and especially for `fulfilsPromiseContent(-, SC)`), the Context MUST be able to derive an evidence link from that Work to `SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef`:
* if `SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef.workSpec` is present, the Work is compatible with `methodConstraintRef` (if present) and satisfies `workPredicateRef`;
* if `SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef.resultSpec` is present, the Work's outputs, affected referents, or effect-delta (and cited evidence carriers) satisfy `postConditionRef` on the referenced `statePlaneRef` (or its declared default plane).
(You MAY materialize this as `deliversPromisedOutcome(Work, OutcomeSpec)` per A.2.3:8.1 for auditability.)

**CC-A2.3-18 (AcceptanceSpec -> OutcomeSpec relation).**
`acceptanceSpec` MUST be written as an evaluation over the same evidence base used to establish delivery of `SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef`. In particular, a Work MUST NOT be judged “pass” for a promise content unless it also delivers the promised outcome spec (see `fulfilsPromiseContent` in A.2.3:8.1). If the Context uses multi‑grade verdicts, it MUST declare how “non‑delivery” is represented (fail, N/A, separate grade).

**CC-A2.3-19 (OutcomeSpec ↔ unitOfDelivery coherence).**
If `unitOfDelivery` is present, its `countingRule.selectorRef` MUST select only Work episodes that are eligible to satisfy `SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef` (`WorkOnly`, `ResultOnly`, or `Composite`) and MUST define how to avoid double counting (via an explicit `dedupeKeyRef` or a policy cited by id) when a single Work episode can satisfy multiple clauses or bundles. The selector MAY be "all fulfilments" (`fulfilsPromiseContent`) but MUST NOT count non-delivering Work episodes.

**CC-A2.3-20 (Unit-of-delivery is computable from Work evidence).**
If `unitOfDelivery` is present, then it MUST declare how delivered units are computed from Work evidence (duration, quantity, cases, kWh, etc) per A.7:5.10.3. The default “1 unit per fulfilment Work” is permitted only when `unitOfDelivery` is a pure count of fulfilment episodes.

### A.2.3:8 - Evidence relations & operators (Promise content ⇄ Work)

To keep the promise-to-evidence relation explicit:

#### A.2.3:8.1 - Core relations

* **`claimsPromiseContent(Work, PromiseContent)`** — the Work instance **intends** to fulfil the promise content (pre‑verdict).
* **`deliversPromisedOutcome(Work, OutcomeSpec)`** - the Work instance evidences delivery of the promised outcome spec (work facet, result facet, or both); derived from Work's input, output, and Delta anchors plus the `U.OutcomeSpec` (and MAY be asserted explicitly for auditability).
* **`acceptanceVerdict(Work, PromiseContent)`** -> {`pass`, `fail`, `partial`, context-specific grades} - computed by applying `acceptanceSpec` (with its declared **Gamma_time** and claim scope) to the same Work facts and evidence used to establish delivery.
* **`fulfilsPromiseContent(Work, PromiseContent)`** — the Work instance both (i) **delivers** the promised outcome spec and (ii) **passes** the promise content’s `acceptanceSpec`.
* **`usesAccess(Work, MethodDescription)`** — consumer Work that uses the service access specification to request or obtain delivery work (when applicable).

> **Invariant:** `fulfilsPromiseContent(W,SC)` ⇒ `claimsPromiseContent(W,SC)` and `deliversPromisedOutcome(W, SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef)` and `acceptanceVerdict(W,SC)=pass`.
> **Invariant:** A Work can claim or fulfil **multiple** promise contents only if the context declares a counting policy (no silent double-counting).

#### A.2.3:8.2 - Service‑clause performance operators

Let `W(SC, T)` be the set of Work that `claimsPromiseContent(-,SC)` within time window `T`. Let `W✓(SC, T)` be those with `fulfilsPromiseContent`.

* **Delivered units:** `delivered(SC, T)` is computed from the set `W✓(SC, T)` using `unitOfDelivery`’s **countingRule** (A.7:5.10). Default (when `unitOfDelivery` is absent): `delivered(SC, T) = |W✓(SC, T)|` (one unit per accepted delivery work).
* **Rejection rate:** `rejectRate(SC, T) = 1 − |W✓(SC,T)| / |W(SC,T)|` (declare handling of `partial`).
* **Lead time:** average or percentile of `duration(Work)` or of request-to-completion delta (declare definition).
* **Availability or uptime:** computed from Work and telemetry events per the context's definition (declare availability source).
* **Cost‑to‑serve:** sum of `Γ_work` over `W✓` per resource category (A.15.1).

All metrics are **functions of Work evidence**; the promise content object is never the bearer of actuals.
Aggregation across time uses `Γ_time` policies (union vs convex hull) chosen by the KPI owner.

### A.2.3:9 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* **“The microservice **is** the service.”**
  Rewrite to facet-explicit terms (A.6.8): the microservice is typically a **service delivery system** (`U.System`), a **service access point** (`U.System`), or both. Keep the consumer-facing promised-outcome statement in `U.PromiseContent`, and represent accountability via `U.Commitment` if needed.

* **“The API **is** the service.”**
  The API is typically a **service access spec** (`accessSpec : MethodDescription`) (and systems playing interface roles). The **promise content** is the promised outcome and acceptance statement judged by `acceptanceSpec`.

* **“Our **process** is the service.”**
  Process or recipe is `U.Method` or `U.MethodDescription`; schedule is `U.WorkPlan`. The **promise content** is **what is promised to the consumer**.

* **“The **ticket** is the service.”**
  A ticket or case is `U.Work` (and perhaps a `WorkPlan` item). Evidence and outcomes sit on Work, not on the promise content.

* **“Attach cost to the service.”**
  Actual cost and time attach to `U.Work` only (A.15.1). Service metrics are computed **from** Work.

* **“Put service under BoM.”**
  Services are not structural parts. Keep PBS and SBS clean.

* **“Hard‑code people into the service.”**
  Name **role kinds** in the promise content (`U.PromiseContent`); run‑time performers are `U.RoleAssignment`s.

### A.2.3:10 - Migration notes (quick wins)

1. **Name the promises.** List 5–15 consumer‑facing promises your context lives by; reify each as `U.PromiseContent` with `acceptanceSpec` and, if needed, `accessSpec` and `unitOfDelivery`.
2. **Separate provider from promise content.** Keep systems or teams as `U.System`; make them providers via `...#ServiceProviderRole:Context`.
3. **Wire evidence.** Ensure every relevant `U.Work` has `claimsPromiseContent` (and `fulfilsPromiseContent` post‑verdict).
4. **Choose metrics.** For each promise content, including local service labels that resolve to promise content, define 2-4 KPIs and the declared Work-based formulas (availability, lead-time, rejection rate, cost-to-serve), declare the **Claim scope (G)** and **Gamma_time** policy used for each KPI, and - when KPIs are numeric or comparable - define the underlying `U.Characteristic` plus measurement procedure and evidence (C.16 and C.25) and pin `{UnitType, ScaleKind, ReferencePlane, EditionId}`.
   → For each **promise content**, define 2–4 KPIs and the Work-based formulas named by value
, with explicit `Γ_time`.
5. **Bridge domains.** If a business ontology already exists ("business service", "technical service", or "internal service"), keep it in its own context and map to FPF Kinds via Bridges.
6. **Tidy language.** Apply **A.6.8 (RPR-SERV)** and **L-SERV**: ban unqualified "service" as a synonym for server, team, process, or ticket in normative prose; map them explicitly.

### A.2.3:10.1 - Consequences

| Consequence | Benefit | Cost or boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Promise content becomes explicit | Work can be judged against the promised outcome, access or eligibility, and acceptance criteria instead of against a vague service label. | Teams must separate promise content from provider, access point, method, ticket, and work occurrence. |
| Commitments stay distinct | A promise-content clause can be reused as payload for `U.Commitment` without becoming the deontic commitment relation itself. | Accountability still needs `A.2.8`, role assignment, and source relations when those claims are current. |
| Work evidence has a target | `claimsPromiseContent`, `deliversPromisedOutcome`, and `fulfilsPromiseContent` can cite the promise and outcome spec. | The promise content does not prove delivery; delivery remains work plus evidence. |

### A.2.3:10.2 - Rationale

Everyday "service" language is useful because it compresses a whole service situation. FPF needs the opposite move when claims become normative: distinguish the promise-content episteme from provider systems, access points, commitments, methods, work, and evidence. `U.PromiseContent` gives the promised-outcome side one stable object while allowing A.6.8 to unpack the wider service situation when the surrounding facets matter.

The pattern keeps promise content in the episteme family because it is a clause or description that work can satisfy or fail to satisfy. It becomes obligation-bearing only through commitment, speech-act, contract-bundle unpacking, gate, or policy relations governed elsewhere.

### A.2.3:10.3 - SoTA-Echoing

Service-management, product, utility, platform, and public-service practice all distinguish offers, providers, access channels, service levels, work execution, and evidence of fulfilment, even when everyday language calls all of them "the service". A.2.3 keeps that practical distinction in FPF by giving the consumer-facing promise clause its own episteme value and by returning provider, access, commitment, work, and evidence claims to their governing patterns.

Contract and SLA practice also distinguishes the promised content from the obligation-bearing act or agreement and from later performance evidence. FPF adapts that separation without importing a domain-specific service taxonomy: the promise content is reusable across IT, utilities, healthcare, public services, manufacturing support, and other bounded contexts.

### A.2.3:11 - Relations

* **Builds on:** A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext`; A.2 `U.Role`; A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment`; A.2.2 `U.Capability`; **A.2.6 `U.Scope` / `U.ClaimScope (G)` / `U.WorkScope`**.
* **Coordinates with:** A.3.1 `U.Method`; A.3.2 `U.MethodDescription`; A.15.1 `U.Work`; A.15.2 `U.WorkPlan`; **A.6.8 (RPR‑SERV)** for normative prose unpacking of the service cluster; **B-line Bridges & CL (CL→R; may recommend ΔG narrowing)**.
* **Constrained by lexical rules:** **E.10 L‑SERV** (service disambiguation); also **L‑FUNC**, **L‑PROC**, **L‑SCHED**, **L‑ACT**.
* **Informs:** Reporting and assurance patterns (service KPIs, SLA dashboards); catalog and exposure patterns in domain contexts.

### A.2.3:12 - Didactic quick cards (engineer‑manager ready)

* **Promise content = Promise content.** *What we advertise and are judged by.*
* **Method description or specification = Recipe.** *How we usually do it (provider-internal).*
* **Work = Evidence.** *What actually happened and consumed resources.*
* **Provider and consumer = Roles.** *assignment via RoleAssigning at run-time.*
* **Metrics from Work.** *Uptime, lead time, quality are computed from Work, not from the Service object.*
* **Keep PBS and SBS clean.** *Services are not parts; they are promises.*
