## A.3 - Transformer Constitution (Quartet)

### A.3:1 - Intent

Establish a substrate-neutral way to say which system performed one dated world-side Work occurrence, under which exact `U.RoleAssignment`, by enacting which `U.Method`, and which separately governed method-description, capability, work-to-change, evidence, or aggregation claims the current use additionally relies on—without self-magic and without blurring run-independent semantics, the occurrence, and an episteme that describes or asserts it. The pattern keeps the **Transformer Quartet** object families distinct; it does not require every change claim or Work assertion to carry all four. `A.3.4` independently identifies an actual bounded change; that identification alone establishes no acting system, agency, role assignment, method, or work. A.3 builds directly on **Holon-Role Duality (A.2)** and **Temporal Duality (A.4)** and is guarded by **Strict Distinction (A.7)** and **Evidence Graph Referring (A.10)**.

### A.3:2 - Context

* **Holonic substrate.** FPF separates *what things are* (Holon → {System, Episteme, …}) from *what they are being right now* via **roles**. Only **systems** can bear **behavioural** roles, enact methods, and perform Work occurrences admitted under `U.Work`; epistemes do not act. This work-facing rule does not imply that every actual change has an acting-system side.
* **Role, method, description, and occurrence stay distinct.** A role is a **mask**, not behaviour; `U.Method` is a run-independent semantic way of doing, `U.MethodDescription` is an episteme that may describe that Method, and each individual admitted under `U.Work` is the dated performed occurrence that enacts it.
* **Run-independent semantics vs dated occurrence.** A Method and any episteme that describes it are not the occurrence. When a claim about actual Work is current, its assertion or description designates the exact Work individual and the independently obtaining performer-assignment, enacted-Method, temporal, containing-system, affected-referent, binding, and resource-use relations required by A.15.1 and the receiving use. When actual change is also claimed, identify it independently under A.3.4 and use a separately governed work-to-change relation.
* **Occurrence, assertion, evidence, and carrier.** One Work individual is the world-side occurrence. A separate `U.Episteme` may assert or describe it and designate the exact occurrence and obtaining relations. Logs, observations, evidence items, and publications have their own carriers and direct relations; neither a carrier nor a record becomes Work by referring to it.

### A.3:3 - Problem

Legacy phrasing (“actor / process / blueprint”) causes recurrent failures:

1. **Self‑magic in an actor-side claim:** “the system configures itself” is used as if it already supplied a performer, role assignment, method, work occurrence, causal relation, and evidence.
2. **Plan = event:** blueprint/algorithm reported as if execution happened.
3. **Capability = result:** possession of a method counted as evidence of work.
4. **Episteme as doer:** documents/models treated as actors.
5. **Occurrence-description leak:** a method, plan, log, ticket, carrier, or evidence item is treated as the dated Work occurrence, while the assertion fails to designate the actual performer assignment, enacted Method, extent, affected referent, and direct relations.
   A.2/A.4/A.7/A.10 collectively forbid these, but A.3 must give the **canonical quartet** that authors can apply consistently.

### A.3:4 - Forces

| Force                       | Tension                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity vs behaviour**   | Keep holon identity stable while roles/behaviours change.                                   |
| **Simplicity vs precision** | Managers want one “process” box; kernel must keep **MethodDescription / Method / Work** distinct.  |
| **Universality vs idioms**  | Pumps, proofs, and data‑pipelines must read the same, yet allow domain names.               |
| **Reusable semantics vs dated occurrence** | Keep Method, any MethodDescription edition, and Work distinct; make each relied-on connection explicit. |
| **Evidence vs mereology**   | Provenance edges (EPV‑DAG) must never turn into part‑whole edges.                           |

### A.3:5 - Solution — The Transformer Quartet

For work-enactment, A.3 keeps four neighboring anchors visible: the performer-side assignment, a MethodDescription edition when the receiving use relies on one, the enacted Method, and the dated Work. For another independently grounded asymmetric actor-side claim, apply only the anchors required by its direct governor. These anchors qualify the actor-side claim; they are not occurrence conditions for every `U.Transformation`.

#### A.3:5.1 - The four anchors (terms & types)

1. **Acting side:** for actual Work, each obtaining `performedBy` relation points from the Work occurrence to an exact `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence whose `HolderSystemSlot` resolves to the admitted performer System. For another actor-side claim, its direct owner grounds the participants and decides whether a work-facing role assignment is current. *Canonical phrase after that grounding:* **system bearing `TransformerRole@Context`**. *Local shorthand:* after explicit binding in the **same subsection**, you MAY write **Transformer** for that same system; re-bind on context change and do not use the shorthand where the domain already has a conflicting transformer term. The shorthand neither identifies an actual transformation nor upgrades causal participation or broad physical agentivity into Work.

2. **MethodDescription (description episteme, when relied on):** an SOP, program, protocol, script, diagram, or other source is a `U.MethodDescription` only when it describes the exact Method. Its exact edition is cited only when the receiving claim about Work, assurance, gate, audit, or another use depends on that description.

3. **Method (run-independent semantic way of doing):** the exact `U.Method` that Work may enact. It is neither an occurrence nor a MethodDescription, role assignment, or holder capability. Order-sensitive composition belongs to B.1.5 only when that composition claim is current.

4. **Work (world-side dated occurrence holon):** `U.Work` is the admitted kind; one Work individual is an independently identified performed occurrence that stands in actual `enactsMethod`, `performedBy`, temporal, `executedWithin`, affected-referent, binding, and resource-use relations as applicable to its identity and the current use. A `U.Episteme` may assert or describe those facts and designate the occurrence; a ticket, log row, record, or carrier is not the Work. The occurrence neither requires one universal MethodDescription edition nor establishes an actual change, result, production, delivery, acceptance, or aggregate merely by occurring.

> **Safe memory line:** *A MethodDescription may describe a Method; one dated world-side Work occurrence may enact that Method; a Work assertion may designate that occurrence.* The description, occurrence, and assertion are different holons, and none of these relations alone establishes actual change or result.
> Roles are **masks** (A.2/A.7); a Method is a reusable way of doing; a Work individual is the performed behaviour occurrence.

#### A.3:5.2 - Contextual Role Assignment (`U.RoleAssignment`) for actor-side enactment

When a performed-work claim relies on a `TransformerRole@Context` assignment, use A.2.1's four-participant relation rather than a holder-role-context triple:

```text
RoleAssignmentAssertion:
  participantDesignations:
    HolderSystemSlot: <admitted U.System>
    RoleValueSlot: TransformerRole@Context
    RoleTaxonomyEpistemeSlot: <exact U.Episteme edition>
    EffectiveReferenceSchemeSlot: <effective U.ReferenceScheme>
  assignmentInterval?: <currently known temporal extent>
```

* The four participant designations correspond to the actual relation participants. `assignmentInterval` is assertion or occurrence-description content: it describes the currently known extent, is not a fifth participant, and does not make the relation obtain.
* A generic `U.BoundedContext` or selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` is not another `U.RoleAssignment` participant. When a receiving assertion or other claim about Work depends on a selected interpretation structure, designate it through that receiving use's exact relation.
* The same system may bear several role values when their direct compatibility rules admit them; labels or shared context wording do not decide compatibility.
* When work on an episteme or carrier is claimed, the acting performer remains a System; episteme identity, carrier change, Work, publication, and evidence retain separate governors.
* An independently grounded `A.3.4` occurrence supplies none of the assignment participants or temporal facts by itself.

#### A.3:5.3 - Boundary & externality

`A.3.4` first identifies the actual bounded change from its changed referent and subject-side occurrence facts. Add an asymmetric **acting** side and **target** side only when a direct participation, interaction, causality, or work owner independently grounds that factorization. If an explicit `U.Interaction` obtains, cite its direct governing relation; A.3 does not create one from the word “transformation.”

Natural, spontaneous, and formal transformations can therefore remain actual without an invented performer. Joint dynamics, relational change, or a non-separable or frame-dependent participation case also remains under its direct dynamics, relation, interaction, or causality owner until an asymmetric actor–target split is justified. Ordinary coupling and scale-free or minimal physical agentivity alone establish neither `TransformerRole@Context`, `U.Method`, nor a dated Work occurrence admitted under `U.Work`.

For genuine work on oneself, use the A.12 reflexive split only after two distinct internal positions are grounded for the current claim. The acting and changed positions may be subholons inside one containing holon; selecting those already grounded parts is an A.14/C.13 structure move, not a Meta-Holon Transition. Use B.2 only if the whole itself is reidentified.

#### A.3:5.4 - Temporal alignment (A.4 bridge)

* A `U.MethodDescription` is a separately identified episteme; cite its exact edition only when the receiving use relies on what that edition says.
* A `U.Method` is run-independent and may be enacted by many dated Work occurrences.
* One Work individual admitted under `U.Work` has its own governed temporal extent and stands in exact `performedBy` relations to its performer assignments; an assertion or description may designate those facts, but is not the occurrence. No universal live `StateAssertion` is a Work or Method condition.
* When a work-to-change claim is current, identify the world-side Work under A.15.1, the actual change under A.3.4, and the exact direct relation between them. A formal ordering boundary or natural change remains under A.3.4 without a work-facing inference.

#### A.3:5.5 - Evidence Graph Referring

An assertion or description episteme about one Work occurrence makes its exact performer assignments and enacted Method recoverable and cites a MethodDescription edition only when the receiving use depends on it. Logs, observations, provenance, evidence, and their carriers remain separately related under their direct owners; neither the assertion nor a carrier or output produced by the performer is the Work occurrence or self-certifying evidence for it or its effects.

#### A.3:5.6 - Didactic dictionary (safe recovery)

* **Process, workflow, SOP, algorithm, protocol, script, or recipe** is source wording first. Recover whether the current object is a MethodDescription, Method, WorkPlan, dated Work, method-relation structure, or another directly governed object.
* **Operation, job, run, or performance** is a Work individual admitted under `U.Work` only when the A.15.1 occurrence basis is recoverable; a log row, ticket, assertion, description, or label does not make it Work.
* **Function in an equipment specification** may describe a Method, a MethodDescription, a capability, an intended effect, or another direct relation; the word alone decides none of them.
* **Creator** becomes local shorthand for a Transformer only when an exact actor-side holder has already been bound as a system through the applicable direct relation and, for performed Work, an obtaining `U.RoleAssignment`; otherwise recover the actual relation or stop.

### A.3:6 - Illustrative scenarios (substrate‑neutral)

#### A.3:6.1 - Physical system — Cooling loop
The world-side occurrence `run-2025-08-08-T14:03`, an individual admitted under `U.Work`, stands in an obtaining `performedBy` relation to an exact RoleAssignment occurrence whose holder is `PumpUnit#3`, and in an actual `enactsMethod` relation to `CirculateCoolingFluid@CoolingLoop`. Cite `centrifugal_pump_curve.ld` as a MethodDescription edition only if the receiving claim about this Work depends on it. A separately obtaining resource-use relation connects the Work individual to the 3.6 kWh use; the measured ΔT=6 K and any actual fluid change remain separately governed measurement, transformation, and work-to-change claims.

#### A.3:6.2 - Epistemic change — Proof revision
The world-side occurrence `lemma-42-check-2025-08-08`, an individual of `U.Work`, stands in an obtaining `performedBy` relation to an exact RoleAssignment occurrence whose holder is `LeanServer`, and in an actual `enactsMethod` relation to `CheckAndReviseLeanProof@Lean`. `proof_tactic.lean`, any exact MethodDescription edition, the theorem episteme, carrier or episteme change, and the check log remain separately governed. An exact evidence-use relation may use the log to support a receiving claim; production by the performer does not itself confer evidence status or support.

#### A.3:6.3 - Reflexive maintenance — “calibrates itself”
When the calibration controller and sensor suite are independently grounded as distinct internal positions, split into **Regulator** (acting position) and **Regulated** (changed position), cite the exact interaction and independently obtaining relations involving any claimed Work occurrence, and keep evidence separately governed; no self-evidence.

#### A.3:6.4 - Joint or non-separable physical participation
A tide-related change of seawater can be one independently grounded `A.3.4` transformation. Moon–Earth–ocean gravitational coupling, joint dynamics, and causal participation are recovered through their direct relation, dynamics, interaction, and causality owners. Coupling or a minimal physical-agentivity reading alone does not make the Moon a holder of `TransformerRole@Context` and does not create `U.Work`. Use `C.26` only if a residual probe-, frame-, order-, incompatible-read-, or no-faithful-export lens issue remains; C.26 is not physical quantum ontology or a second transformation owner.

#### A.3:6.5 - Reflexive work — scratching oneself
For a genuine work-on-oneself claim, the containing holon is the person, the acting position is the grounded neural-control/right-arm subsystem, and the changed position is the grounded left-hand tissue or state. The exact `U.RoleAssignment`, applicable method, dated work, work-to-change facts, and `A.3.4` occurrence remain separate. Selecting these already grounded subholons uses A.14/C.13; it is not an MHT unless the person as a whole is reidentified under B.2.

### A.3:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A3‑0 - U.RoleAssignment presence.**
A world-side Work occurrence performed by a system bearing `TransformerRole@Context` MUST stand in an exact obtaining `performedBy` relation to a `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence. A conforming assertion or description designates the Work, assignment, and relation; the assignment has A.2.1's four participants: exact holder System, role value, role-taxonomy episteme edition, and effective ReferenceScheme. State the currently known assignment extent separately as `assignmentInterval` in the assignment assertion or occurrence description when needed. A context label is not a generic fifth participant. For a non-Work actor-side claim, use its direct governor and introduce a work-facing assignment only when that relation is independently current.

**CC‑A3‑1 - Acting-side distinction.**
When an asymmetric actor-side claim is current, its directly governed acting and changed positions MUST be distinct for that claim. When performed Work is current, each obtaining `performedBy` relation reaches an exact RoleAssignment occurrence. In reflexive Work the acting and changed positions MAY be grounded subholons or positions inside one containing holon; the containing holon need not be reidentified. Do not force this split or a role assignment onto a natural, joint, relational, non-separable, or formal change merely to satisfy A.3. This preserves acting-side externalization without fictive actors.

**CC‑A3‑2 - Method-description-Work-assertion separation.**
`U.MethodDescription` is a description episteme, `U.Method` is a run-independent semantic way of doing, and a Work individual admitted under `U.Work` is a world-side dated performed occurrence. A Work assertion or description is another `U.Episteme`; a log, ticket, or carrier may express or support it but is not the occurrence. Neither Method nor MethodDescription is a run-time occurrence. A changed description edition and performed Work are separate facts, and a claim that Work occurred remains admissible without a MethodDescription reference when no receiving use relies on an exact description edition.

**CC‑A3‑3 - Boundary-crossing evidence.**
A conforming actor-side or work-to-change assertion MUST designate the exact direct participation, interaction, flow, causality, or work-to-change facts on which it relies; an `A.3.4` occurrence alone supplies none of them. Conservation-class effects, when claimed, MUST satisfy the applicable B-invariants.

**CC‑A3‑4 - Method and conditional description traceability.**
Every Work individual admitted under `U.Work` stands in an exact actual `enactsMethod` relation to the `U.Method` it enacts; the assertion or description used by a receiving claim MUST designate both sides and that relation. Cite an exact `U.MethodDescription` edition only when the receiving claim depends on that edition to identify, constrain, or justify the Method. If actual enactment departs from a cited description, state the description-selection, override, exception, or deviation claim under its direct owner and apply the Work continuity policy to the actual occurrence facts. Absence of a description reliance claim is not silent drift.

**CC‑A3‑5 - Episteme as object-under-change.**
When Work on an episteme or its carrier is claimed, the performer is still a System; episteme identity, carrier continuity, edition succession, publication, and any actual carrier change remain under their direct owners. Do not infer a performer from the episteme change itself, and do not force every episteme history into one `PhaseOf` relation. See C.2.1, E.24.PUB, A.14's mereology firewalls, and direct epistemic aggregation owners when current.

**CC‑A3‑6 - Units and measures for performed resource use.**
Every performed resource-use fact relied on for a claim about Work MUST state its measure and units. A percentage that enters a resource aggregation must be grounded in the exact PortionOf measure needed by that use. Totals, allocation, overlap handling, deduplication, and optional `Gamma_work` notation belong to a separately recovered B.1.6 aggregation, not to Work identity.

**CC‑A3‑7 - Authority, justification, and provenance boundary.**
Authority, justification, and provenance are not optional-looking required fields of a RoleAssignment occurrence or Work occurrence. When a receiving use relies on one of them, identify the exact episteme and direct authority, justification, source, evidence, or provenance relation and connect it to the exact assignment occurrence, Work individual, assertion, or description. None of those neighboring claims makes the assignment obtain or the Work occur.

**CC‑A3‑8 - Agentic policy, planning, Work, and outcome separation.**
An agentic case does not license a generic pipeline from policy, through a planned action, to an action. Recover each exact policy, objective, selection or decision, WorkPlan, RoleAssignment, dated Work, actual change, and outcome claim under its direct owner when that claim is current. A policy does not create a plan or Work; a plan does not prove Work; and Work does not prove an outcome. Do not mint `U.PlannedAction` or `U.Action` from ordinary action wording.

**CC‑A3‑9 - Local interpretation and exact crossings.**
Interpret each RoleAssignment occurrence through its exact role-taxonomy episteme and effective ReferenceScheme, and test compatibility through the exact rule current for that assignment use. Similar labels across localities establish neither equivalence nor conflict. When a receiving use needs exact local-sense correspondence, use F.9 only for the exact `SenseCell` correspondence and its admitted use; role-value, policy, criterion, verdict, or other mappings retain their direct owners.

**CC‑A3‑10 - Use-driven aggregation boundary.**
Neither a MethodDescription nor an assertion about Work MUST make every Gamma family runnable. When a receiving use needs order-sensitive Method composition, recover B.1.5 and optional `Gamma_method`; when it needs a temporal aggregate over exact Work intervals, recover B.1.4 and optional `Gamma_time`; when it needs a resource ledger, recover B.1.6 and optional `Gamma_work`. A system-boundary or epistemic aggregation likewise uses its exact direct owner. Each aggregation has its own EntityOfConcern, policy, evidence, and admissible use; none is a universal field or identity condition of MethodDescription, RoleAssignment, or Work.

### A.3:8 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Explainability by construction.** A conforming assertion about performed Work designates the world-side occurrence, exact `performedBy` RoleAssignment occurrences, enacted Method, and the direct neighboring description, capability, work-to-change, evidence, or aggregation claims on which the current use actually relies; actual-change identity remains separately inspectable under A.3.4.
* **No category errors.** Keeping methods/roles out of mereology and enforcing DesignRunTag separation prevents the usual “process‑as‑part” and “version‑as‑component” mistakes. (A.14 + A.15.)
* **Composable analytics without hidden ownership.** Exact Work intervals and performed resource-use facts can feed separately recovered B.1.4 or B.1.6 aggregations; the selected policy, evidence, and result remain inspectable at that direct owner.
* **Local plurality without whole-context bridges.** Exact role taxonomies, ReferenceSchemes, compatibility rules, and use-specific mappings let local practices differ without treating a shared label or one bridge as wholesale equivalence.

**Trade‑offs**

* **More explicit separation when reliance needs it.** Start with the smallest grounded performer-assignment, Method, and Work claims; add MethodDescription, capability, policy, plan, change, evidence, and aggregation relations only when a named use depends on them.
* **Discipline for genuine reflexive work.** Modellers must ground distinct acting and changed positions before using a controller–plant or other reflexive split; this adds one relation when the claim needs it and avoids both self-magic and arbitrary decomposition.

### A.3:9 - Rationale (post‑2015 cross‑domain support)

**Constructor theory (post‑2015).**
Constructor theory informs the distinction between possible and impossible tasks and the conditions on substrates and constructors. A.3 adopts that modal discipline without equating a constructor-theory constructor with an FPF performer or `TransformerRole` holder. In the performed-Work branch, an independently grounded System may be the holder of an exact RoleAssignment, and a Work occurrence performed under that assignment may enact an exact Method; natural, spontaneous, joint, formal, or otherwise non-agentive transformation remains possible without that actor-side factorization. A MethodDescription may describe a task or Method, but it is neither the constructor nor the Work. ([Royal Society Publishing][1], [arXiv][2], [Constructor Theory][3])

**Active inference & free‑energy mechanics (2017→).**
When an agentic claim is current, active-inference and free-energy work motivates keeping policy, objective, observation, selection, planning, performed Work, and evidence distinctions visible under their direct owners. It does not supply a universal action pipeline, make agentivity a Work occurrence, or make one policy, plan, or posterior prove another. ([MIT Press Direct][4], [PubMed][5], [arXiv][6])

**Provenance and FAIR packaging (2016→).**
FAIR, RO-Crate, OpenLineage, and ML Metadata motivate exact, machine-actionable provenance and evidence links when a receiving use relies on lineage, editions, runs, or jobs. A.3 therefore preserves those links as separately governed relations rather than making `{authority, justification, provenance}` constitutive fields of RoleAssignment or Work. ([Nature][7], [researchobject.org][8], [SAGE Journals][9], [openlineage.io][10], [GitHub][11], [arXiv][12])

Together, these lines of work support **explicit actor-side participants and, for performed Work, exact role-assignment and performer relations**, **method-description/Method/Work separation**, **directly governed participation and deltas**, and **traceable local interpretation**. They do not establish that every actual change has a performer, that broad physical agentivity supplies `TransformerRole`, or that coupling alone is `U.Work`.

### A.3:10 - Relations

**A.7 Strict Distinction.**
A.3 keeps the target EntityOfConcern, MethodDescription, Method, RoleAssignment occurrence, dated Work occurrence, Work assertion or description, actual change, log or observation, and evidence relation distinct. A recipe or log is not part of the target, and a record about Work is not the Work occurrence.

**A.12 Acting-Side Externalization & External Transformer.**
A.3's CC-A3-1 uses A.12 only when an actor-side or reflexive-work claim is current. The split keeps grounded acting and changed positions distinct for that claim; it neither invents an actor for non-separable change nor turns ordinary descent to already grounded parts into an MHT.

**A.13 Agential Role.**
When an agency claim is current, A.13 governs agenthood and the domain profile, while A.17, A.18, A.19, C.16, and A.10 govern its measurement and evidence as applicable; planned C.9 may later consolidate the profile but supplies no current governing force. A.3 keeps identity, role assignment, method, plan, work, transformation, and evidence separate. Scale-free or minimal physical agentivity, observerhood, self-evidencing, or causal participation does not by itself establish an obtaining `U.RoleAssignment`, `TransformerRole@Context`, method enactment, or dated Work.

**A.3.4 Bounded Change Under Conditions.**
A.3.4 independently identifies one actual bounded transformation from the changed referent and subject-side occurrence facts. A.3 opens only when an actor-side enactment claim is additionally grounded. Natural, spontaneous, formal, relational, and joint-dynamics changes therefore need no fictive performer.

**A.3.3, direct relation, interaction, and causality owners.**
These owners establish participation and causal structure. Use an asymmetric actor-target factorization only when that result is independently grounded; retain a joint or non-separable account otherwise. `C.26` may test a residual probe, frame, order, incompatible-read, or no-faithful-export lens issue, but it is neither physical quantum ontology nor a second transformation owner.

**A.15 Role-Method-Work Alignment.**
A.3 relies on A.15's separation of role value, exact world-side RoleAssignment occurrence, run-independent Method, conditional MethodDescription reliance, intended WorkPlan episteme, world-side dated Work occurrence, and any assertion, description, log, or evidence about that occurrence. The Work stands in an actual `enactsMethod` relation; a MethodDescription may describe the Method; neither the description, plan, nor record proves that Work or actual change occurred.

**A.14 Advanced Mereology.**
A.3 consumes A.14/C.13 only for independently grounded part or structure relations and forbids role or recipe leakage into part-whole trees. Selecting grounded internal positions for a reflexive claim is not an MHT; B.2 opens only when the containing whole is actually reidentified.

**B-cluster (Gamma sections).**
A.3 supplies grounded actor-side facts and exact Work occurrences; receiving assertions may designate them, but A.3 does not require a universal bundle of Gamma calculations. B.1.5 governs order-sensitive Method composition and optional `Gamma_method`; B.1.4 governs a selected temporal aggregation and optional `Gamma_time`; B.1.6 governs a selected Work-resource aggregation and optional `Gamma_work`. System-boundary and epistemic aggregations use their exact direct patterns when current. Every such result has its own EntityOfConcern, policy, evidence, and admissible use rather than becoming a field or identity condition of MethodDescription, RoleAssignment, or Work.

**Indexing to the glossary.**
