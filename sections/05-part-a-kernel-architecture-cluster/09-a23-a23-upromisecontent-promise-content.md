## A.2.3 - `U.PromiseContent` (Promise Content)
> **Type:** Definitional promise-content episteme pattern
> **Status:** Stable

### A.2.3:0.1 - Kind Settlement

`U.PromiseContent` is a dependent durable promised-outcome episteme under the episteme settlement. It is not a root beside `U.Episteme`, not a commitment, not work, and not a `U.PresentationCarrier`.

### A.2.3:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when a project needs to state what is promised to a consumer before asking who is obligated, what work occurred, which system exposes access, or which evaluation method and A.10 evidence relations support a fulfilment assertion.

Typical moments:

- an SLA publication, service catalog, product offer, public API promise, utility offer, or government-service description contains a statement about what a consumer may rely on;
- a team says "the service" but might mean promise content, provider organization, API, access point, delivery system, method, ticket, or performed work;
- a fulfilment claim needs evaluation work that applies declared acceptance criteria to exact delivery-work facts, affected entities and post-work states, and any exact delivery or acceptance relation current for the use; the actual evaluation-operation result binding, optional verdict episteme, and A.10 evidence relations remain separate;

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** The EntityOfConcern of this pattern is `U.PromiseContent`: a consumer-facing promise-content episteme. At species level, its C.2.1 `EntityOfConcernSlot` is filled by the A.7 `OutcomeSpec` episteme denoted by `promisedOutcomeSpecRef`. Its claim graph states the promised outcome, any eligibility predicate, and acceptance claims; `accessSpec` separately describes the access method when that description is current.

**First useful move.** Write the promise content as a clause: what outcome is promised, which consumer role and claim scope are eligible, how access is described when relevant, and which acceptance criteria selected work facts and post-work states must satisfy. Name the evaluation method, evidence epistemes, and A.10 evidence relations separately so a fulfilment assertion can be checked. Then use `U.Commitment` only when an accountable subject is assigned to that content.

**What goes wrong if missed.** The word "service" starts naming provider, API, method, ticket, work, department, and promise at once. Teams then judge work against an implicit promise, treat access systems as obligations, or count performed work without knowing which promised outcome it was meant to satisfy.

**What this buys.** One consumer-facing promise-content episteme with direct exits to commitment, role assignment, access, `PromiseContentUse`, performed delivery work, affected entities and states, evaluation-operation results, optional verdict epistemes, evidence, acceptance, and publication patterns. Each neighboring claim keeps its named `EntityOfConcern` and direct relation instead of being collapsed into one undifferentiated service referent.

**Not this pattern when.** If the current EntityOfConcern is the accountable deontic relation, use `A.2.8`; if it is performed delivery Work, use `A.15.1`; if service/access wording hides its concrete subject or direct relation, start with A.6.P:4.11a. An exact bearer or access-providing arrangement is only one possible recovered reading; code or another episteme, Method, Work/run, participation, promise, permission, status, and direct relations keep their own readings. Use A.1/A.1.SCR only when a separate repaired claim depends on that exact entity being a system. If the current move is Contract Bundle unpacking, use `A.6.C`.

### A.2.3:1 - Problem frame

Across domains the word **service** is used for many different things: a server or **provider**, an **API**, a **procedure**, a **run**, a **department**, even a **product bundle**. Such polysemy is productive in everyday speech but toxic in a normative model.

FPF therefore reserves **`U.PromiseContent`** for one kernel meaning: a consumer-facing **promise content** clause. When *service* denotes something else, use **A.6.P:4.11a** to recover whether it denotes code or another episteme, a Method, Work/run, provider participation, an exact bearer or access-providing arrangement, permission, status, or a direct relation. A product label chooses none of these readings, and bare *service* has no default system reading. Apply A.1/A.1.SCR only when a separate repaired claim depends on an exact recovered entity being a system; normative prose then names that referent or relation and its direct owner.

This keeps the kernel minimal while keeping the prose readable to non‑mathematicians: the canonical symbol is `U.PromiseContent`, and the head kind in normative text is always *promise content*.

**Modularity note.** A.2.3 defines the promise-content episteme and `PromiseContentUse`. Role assignment, access specification, delivery work, actual operation application and result binding, result-episteme identity, affected-subject change, A.10 evidence relations, evaluation, commitment, delivery, acceptance, speech act, and publication remain with their direct governing patterns. A.6.P:4.11a recovers which concrete service/access referent or relation the wording denotes; it does not replace the named participants and their direct relations with a locally minted service-situation relation. A.6.C governs the Contract Bundle lens when contract, SLA, or guarantee wording must be unpacked.

**Plain reading.** Promise content says what a consumer may rely on. A system holding the provider role through a named `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence performs delivery work by enacting a `U.Method`; a `U.MethodDescription` describes that method. `PromiseContentUse` obtains between the delivery-work occurrence and the selected promise-content edition during the named interval. Exact work-participation, affected-referent, actual-change, delivery, and acceptance relations state what happened. A separately performed evaluation applies the declared operation or method; its actual result binding states the evaluation value. If another use needs a verdict episteme, C.2.1 governs that episteme and A.15.PROD governs any current entity-identity-inception claim. Evidence relations support the relied-on assertions. No universal work-result relation is presumed.

**Lexical note (L-SERV and A.6.P:4.11a).** Bare *service* does not determine one FPF referent. When that word carries a relied-on claim, use A.6.P:4.11a to recover the concrete referent or relation: for example, a promise-content episteme and an access-point system have different kinds and participate in different relations. E.10 `L-SERV` triggers that recovery; after the referent or relation is known, its direct governing pattern applies.

### A.2.3:2 - Problem

Without a first-class `U.PromiseContent`, a project description tends to make five recurring category errors:

1. **Provider = Service.** Calling the provider **system** or team “the service” collapses that provider referent with the promise-content episteme.
2. **API = Service.** Treating an **interface or endpoint** as the service hides the promised consumer-side outcome and its acceptance criteria.
3. **Method or plan = promise content.** Treating a semantic method, a method-description episteme, or a work plan as the promise content hides the consumer-facing outcome and acceptance claims.
4. **Run = Service.** Logging **Work** as "a service" erases the promise-content episteme and acceptance specification needed for SLA reasoning.
5. **Business ontology lock-in.** Large domain schemes are imported wholesale, losing FPF universality and comparability across projects and domains.

### A.2.3:3 - Forces

| Force                                       | Tension                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **External promise vs internal capability** | Promise content must be consumer‑facing, while capability is provider‑internal.                               |
| **Specification vs execution** | Promise content remains an episteme; exact delivery-work facts, affected entities, post-work states, and separately governed delivery or acceptance relations are evaluated against the promised predicates. The evaluation operation's result binding and any verdict episteme remain distinct from those subject facts. |
| **Universality vs domain richness**         | One kernel meaning must cover IT, utilities, healthcare, public services—without absorbing domain taxonomies. |
| **Reviewable acceptance vs method autonomy** | Consumers need named outcome predicates, characteristics, scales, target values, and acceptance criteria. Systems assigned provider roles retain freedom to select delivery methods through method-selection work; deontic accountability enters only through an explicit `U.Commitment`. |
| **Stability vs evolution** | A changed promise creates a new promise-content episteme edition, while earlier work occurrences and evidence relations retain their own identities. |

### A.2.3:4 - Solution - Define `U.PromiseContent` as the promise-content episteme

**Definition (normative).**
A **`U.PromiseContent`** is an externally oriented promise-content episteme. Its claim content states a promised consumer-side outcome, any eligibility predicate, and acceptance criteria by which fulfilment is evaluated. Its optional `accessSpec` describes the access method. Interpretation is fixed by its effective `U.ReferenceScheme`; `U.ClaimScope` states where the claims hold.

`U.PromiseContent` is not a deontic commitment relation. One or more explicit `U.Commitment` occurrences under A.2.8 may have the promise content in their referents position; the promise-content episteme does not obligate an actor by itself.

In normative prose, the head phrase is **promise content**. **Service offering clause** and **service promise clause** are admissible Plain twins for that promise-content use; bare *service* does not identify a promise-content episteme.

Species-level identity follows C.2.1:

```text
PromiseContentIdentity = <
  content,
  promisedOutcomeSpecRef,
  effectiveReferenceScheme
>
```

`promisedOutcomeSpecRef` is the species-level realization of `EntityOfConcernSlot`; it is a `U.EpistemeRef` that resolves to the A.7 `OutcomeSpec` episteme about which the promise claims are made. `OutcomeSpec` is a specification-use episteme form, not a separately admitted U-kind. `claimScope` and optional `modelUseStructureRef` qualify interpretation and applicability of the promise-content claims; they are not generic identity positions. A direct dependent species may strengthen identity only through its own governing pattern.

* **FPF kind:** `U.Episteme`.
* **Time stance:** the promise content can be authored before delivery; later exact delivery-work facts, affected entities, post-work states, and any current delivery or acceptance relations are tested against the declared outcome and acceptance predicates. Evaluation work and the actual operation-result binding remain separate; when a verdict episteme is constituted, C.2.1 and A.15.PROD govern its identity and inception, while A.10 evidence relations support the relied-on assertions.
* **Orientation:** consumer-facing promise claims, not provider capability claims.
* **Publication boundary:** `isCarriedBy` may obtain between a `U.EpistemePublication` and a `U.PresentationCarrier`. Promise-content identity follows the C.2.1 episteme identity rule; neither the `isCarriedBy` occurrence nor carrier identity enters that rule.

#### A.2.3:4.1 - Promise-content schema

```text
U.PromiseContent : U.Episteme {
  content                  : U.ClaimGraph,
  promisedOutcomeSpecRef   : U.EpistemeRef, resolving to OutcomeSpec,
  effectiveReferenceScheme: U.ReferenceScheme,
  providerRole             : U.Role,
  consumerRole?            : U.Role,
  claimScope?              : U.ClaimScope,
  accessSpec?              : U.MethodDescription,
  acceptanceSpec           : U.Episteme,
  unitOfDelivery?          : U.Episteme,
  modelUseStructureRef?    : U.StructureRef
}
```

* `content` carries the promised-outcome, eligibility, and acceptance claims together with the optional `accessSpec` value when an access-method description is current; it is not an untyped text slot.
* `providerRole` and `consumerRole` are `U.Role` values carried by value in the claim graph. `accessSpec`, `acceptanceSpec`, and `unitOfDelivery` are episteme values carried by value in the claim graph; a publication or other declared representation may express them through `U.EpistemeRef` values that resolve to those same epistemes without changing their kinds. Changing any of these values changes `content` and therefore the promise-content identity.
* `promisedOutcomeSpecRef` resolves to the A.7 `OutcomeSpec` episteme. It is neither a `U.Work` occurrence, an affected or delivered entity, an actual operation-result binding, nor a verdict episteme.
* `effectiveReferenceScheme` makes the claim graph and its references interpretable.
* `providerRole` and `consumerRole` are role values; actual providers and consumers enter through named `U.RoleAssignment` occurrences.
* `claimScope` states the operating conditions, populations, locales, or other slices over which the promise claims hold.
* `accessSpec` describes the access method enacted when a holder system under an eligible consumer `U.RoleAssignment` requests access; an access-point system remains separate.
* `acceptanceSpec` states the acceptance criteria, identifies the evaluation method through its `U.MethodDescription`, and states evidence-admissibility conditions for supported assertions; actual evidence relations remain separate.
* `unitOfDelivery` states how accepted delivery work is counted when counting is current.
* `modelUseStructureRef` is present only when an independently selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` changes interpretation for the current `PromiseContentUse` occurrence.
* An internal delivery method remains `U.Method`. An already identified episteme is a `U.MethodDescription` only when its exact `EntityOfConcern` resolves to that Method and at least one claim says how that Method is done. A promise-content or acceptance claim may cite that episteme for one named use; Method-selection work, performed work, and `PromiseContentUse` remain separately governed.

#### A.2.3:4.1.1 - Promised outcome spec (disambiguation: work vs post-work result)

`promisedOutcomeSpecRef` points to an A.7 `OutcomeSpec` episteme that makes explicit **what is promised** in kind form and specification form without collapsing it into either:

* the **promise content clause** itself (`U.PromiseContent`),
* the **delivery work** that happens at run‑time (`U.Work`), or
* the **post-work state or affected referent** after the work.

This is a controlled **semantic precision restoration** for the everyday metonymy "outcome" or "service outcome", which different communities use to mean (i) the work performed, (ii) the achieved result, or (iii) both.

**Terminology bridge (informative).**
In loose contract talk people say **promiseOutcomeSpec** (the description of what will be delivered) and **promiseOutcome** (what was actually delivered). Those lexical forms are metonymic: sometimes they mean “the work performed”, sometimes “the post‑work result”, and sometimes the pair.

In FPF:

* **promiseOutcomeSpec** -> A.7 `OutcomeSpec`, referenced via `promisedOutcomeSpecRef`.
* **promiseOutcome** -> an **extensional delivered outcome instance**. It does not have one kernel kind; it is the run-time reality that satisfies the outcome specification, interpreted according to `OutcomeSpec.mode`:

  * `WorkOnly` → the **set of delivery `U.Work` episode(s)** that satisfy `workSpec` (and, if present, the promised `methodConstraintRef`).
  * `ResultOnly` → the **post‑work state of the described referent(s)** on the declared `statePlaneRef` that satisfies `resultSpec.postConditionRef` (regardless of how it was achieved).
  * `Composite` → the pair: **(delivery Work episode(s), post‑work state)**.

  FPF identifies the extensional delivered outcome by citing the relevant `U.Work` occurrences, exact affected or delivered entities, applicable actual-change and delivery relations, and the selected Delta expression for affected referents together with their pre-work and post-work states on the declared state plane (A.15.1:4.2 item 10). Evidence epistemes derived from telemetry may enter A.10 evidence relations supporting claims about those facts and states and about later evaluation-result epistemes; neither an evidence episteme nor the `U.PresentationCarrier` filling the carrier position of its `isCarriedBy` relation is the delivered outcome.

When bundling, invoicing, or dispute handling needs a downstream claim to identify the delivered instance, that claim's episteme separately references the delivery-work occurrences, affected entities, post-work states, evidence epistemes, and A.10 evidence-relation occurrences under their direct governing patterns. It does not create a local `OutcomeInstance` kind, collapse the delivered reality into `OutcomeSpec`, or let an invoice, dispute record, other record form, or `U.PresentationCarrier` become either the episteme or the delivered instance.

A conforming `OutcomeSpec` uses this explicit-RefKind reading of the specification-use shape in A.7:5.10.2:

```
OutcomeSpec : U.Episteme ::= {
  mode: WorkOnly | ResultOnly | Composite,

  workSpec?: {
    methodConstraintRef?: U.EpistemeRef,          // resolves to the U.MethodDescription constraining the promised work
    workPredicateRef: U.EpistemeRef               // resolves to a predicate on selected facts about U.Work occurrences
  },

  resultSpec?: {
    entityOfConcernRef?: U.EntityRef,             // affected referent whose declared FPF kind is named
    statePlaneRef?: StatePlaneRef,                // where the predicate lives (A.7:3 pins)
    postConditionRef: U.EpistemeRef               // resolves to the post-state predicate; evidence supports the resulting claim separately
  }
}
```

* `workSpec` corresponds to the **work-as-promised** facet: it states the consumer-facing *kind* of work (optionally constraining method) and the work predicate (e.g., duration, method ban, safety limit).
* `resultSpec` corresponds to the **result-as-promised** facet: `entityOfConcernRef` identifies the affected entity, `statePlaneRef` identifies the state plane when current, and `postConditionRef` identifies the required post-work state predicate.
* **Counting is not part of `OutcomeSpec`.** Counting lives in `U.PromiseContent.unitOfDelivery` as the `countingRule` mini-schema (A.7:5.10.3). Outcome specifications say what counts as delivery; unit-of-delivery specifications say how much to count and how to avoid double counting.

**Examples (informative):**

* “Work 5 minutes” → `mode=WorkOnly`; `workPredicateRef` states duration ≥ 5 min; `methodConstraintRef` may be omitted.
* “Dig a hole” → `mode=ResultOnly`; `postConditionRef` describes the hole’s target state; method choice remains provider‑autonomous.
* “Hairstyle in ≤ 20 min, must be haircut+styling (not a wig)” → `mode=Composite`; `workSpec` expresses time + method constraint; `resultSpec` expresses the target hairstyle state.

**Naming note (normative).**
The head noun **outcome** is intentionally broad. Do **not** replace it with **result** when referring to the combined work-and-result specification. If a passage means the affected entity, name that entity and link it to `resultSpec.entityOfConcernRef`. If it means the required post-work state, name the state predicate and link it to `resultSpec.postConditionRef`. If it means the promised work occurrences, say **work as promised** and link them to `workSpec`.

#### A.2.3:4.1.2 - Recommended `acceptanceSpec` mini‑schema *(informative, non‑kernel)*

Projects may express `acceptanceSpec` with the following small schema when downstream evaluation work requires replayable criteria and verdict semantics:

```
AcceptanceSpec (recommended) ::= {
  targetOutcomeSpecRef?: U.EpistemeRef,          // resolves to OutcomeSpec; default is SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef
  criterionRefs: [U.EpistemeRef],                // each resolves to one evaluation-criterion episteme
  evaluationMethodDescriptionRef: U.EpistemeRef, // resolves to the U.MethodDescription for evaluation work
  verdictScaleDescriptionRef: U.EpistemeRef,     // resolves to one declared scale description
  GammaTimePolicyRef?: U.EpistemeRef             // resolves to the policy selecting the evaluation window
}
```

* **`targetOutcomeSpecRef`** makes explicit *which* promised outcome is being judged; if omitted, it is the containing promise content’s `promisedOutcomeSpecRef`.
* **`criterionRefs`** resolve to evaluation-criterion epistemes. Their predicates are evaluated over the same selected work facts and post-work state references used for the targeted `OutcomeSpec`; direct evidence relations separately support assertions about those facts and states.
* **`evaluationMethodDescriptionRef`** resolves to the `U.MethodDescription` for the method enacted by evaluation work. The description does not perform the evaluation.
* **`verdictScaleDescriptionRef`** resolves to one scale-description episteme governed by the characteristic and scale patterns. That description states the admitted verdict values and how non-delivery is represented. Informative examples include Boolean `pass/fail`, trichotomy `pass/partial/fail`, or named graded values, with non-delivery represented as `fail`, `N/A`, or `Inconclusive`; these values are examples, not defaults.
* **`GammaTimePolicyRef`** keeps temporal selection explicit and non-retroactive (F.10 and F.12): it resolves to the policy stating whether judgement is per work occurrence, reporting window, or another named temporal selection. Population and locale remain in `U.ClaimScope`; they are not temporal-policy values.

This mini-schema is a recommendation only: it does not admit another U-kind. An acceptance-specification episteme may contain these declared schema fields by value or refer to their values through the declared RefKinds. The resulting episteme remains inspectable and bridge-ready without turning its publication form into identity.

#### A.2.3:4.2 - What `U.PromiseContent` is **not**

* **Not a provider:** use a named provider `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence whose holder is the provider `U.System`.
* **Not a deontic commitment:** that is `U.Commitment` (A.2.8) whose `referents` include the promise content when that accountable relation is current.
* **Not an access point or bearer:** addressable *service*, server, desk, endpoint, process, component, application, host, or cluster wording first goes to A.6.P:4.11a. Recover whether it denotes code or another episteme, a Method, Work/run, an exact bearer or access-providing arrangement, or another directly governed object; apply A.1/A.1.SCR only when a separate repaired claim depends on an exact recovered entity being a system.
* **Not a method or method description:** the semantic way of doing is `U.Method`; a recipe or other episteme describing that way is `U.MethodDescription`.
* **Not delivery work or its description:** performed delivery is `U.Work`; a ticket, case description, or incident description is a separately governed episteme about planned or performed work.
* **Not a schedule:** that is `U.WorkPlan`.
* **Not a capability:** capability is the provider system's admitted ability to perform a declared work family and meet any declared result-class predicate within its `U.WorkScope`, measure set, qualification window, and currentness condition. Delivery under a promise may depend on one or more capability instances, but the promise-content episteme is not a capability.
* **Not its scope or use interval:** `U.ClaimScope` states where the promise claims hold, `U.WorkScope` states where a provider capability can deliver work, and `PromiseUseIntervalSlot` states when one `PromiseContentUse` occurrence obtains. These are three different values.

#### A.2.3:4.3 - Promise content, delivery work, and evaluation work

* **Before delivery work:**
  The promise-content episteme declares its effective `U.ReferenceScheme`, named `U.ClaimScope`, promised outcome specification, access specification when current, and acceptance specification. The provider system's ability remains a holder-dependent `U.Capability` instance under A.2.2. A capability-fit predicate tests that instance against the thresholds selected for the planned delivery work, including any threshold stated by the chosen method description. Method-selection work may yield a C.11 `ChoiceResult`; `enactsMethod` obtains between the later delivery-work occurrence and the selected `U.Method`. A relied-on episteme is a `U.MethodDescription` only when it meets A.3.2 membership, and the promise-content or acceptance claim may cite it for the named use. That citation establishes neither Method selection, later `enactsMethod`, `PromiseContentUse`, evidence, nor acceptance.

* **Run‑time:**
  The admitted holder system `S = consumerRA.HolderSystemSlot` of the named consumer `U.RoleAssignment` performs request or visit `U.Work` under that assignment. When the attribution is stated explicitly, use `performedUnderAssignment(requestWork, consumerRA)`.
  The admitted holder system `S = providerRA.HolderSystemSlot` of the named provider `U.RoleAssignment` performs delivery `U.Work` under that assignment. When the attribution is stated explicitly, use `performedUnderAssignment(deliveryWork, providerRA)`.
  A system performing evaluation work enacts the evaluation method described by `acceptanceSpec`; the actual evaluation-operation application carries its exact argument bindings and evaluation-result value. When another use needs a durable verdict episteme, C.2.1 governs that episteme and A.15.PROD governs any current entity-identity-inception claim. The counting rule stated by `unitOfDelivery` maps admitted fulfilment occurrences to unit counts.
  The verdict episteme may assert whether a named service-level objective or another acceptance criterion was satisfied during the declared window. When a separately obtaining `U.Commitment` has the same `U.PromiseContent` in its referents position, the supported assertion concerns fulfilment of content that is also a referent of the obligation. Neither the operation-result binding, verdict episteme, nor commitment is a property of the promise-content episteme.

  In each `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` occurrence, `WorkOccurrenceSlot` is filled by `W` and `RoleAssignmentSlot` by the named A.2.1 assignment occurrence `RA`; the admitted holder system `S = RA.HolderSystemSlot` is the actual performer. The assignment does not act, and no provider-assignment or consumer-assignment pseudo-kind is introduced.

> **Memory hook:** *Promise content states what is promised. A method constrains possible work. A system performs work. Evaluation binds a result value. A verdict episteme states the judgment. Evidence supports that assertion.*

#### A.2.3:4.4 - Didactic card: Relations around one service-delivery evaluation

> **Didactic (non-normative).** This representation keeps each promise-content episteme, access-description episteme, work occurrence, and direct relation in one delivery evaluation visible without prescribing an order of work. Promise content and an access description remain epistemes; commitment and role assignment remain relations; delivery and evaluation remain work occurrences; evidence remains in its A.10 relations. When order matters, describe semantic method order in `U.MethodDescription`, intended dated order in `U.WorkPlan`, and transformation dependencies in the governing `TransformationFlowStructure`.
>
> `U.PromiseContent` states the promise. An A.2.8 `U.Commitment` relation may refer to that content; its accountable-subject position is filled by the accountable subject. In a provider `U.RoleAssignment`, the holder-system and role-value positions are filled by the provider system and provider role. Delivery `U.Work` occurs. Evidence relations support claims about selected delivery-work facts and post-work states. A system performing evaluation work enacts the evaluation method; the actual operation application carries its result binding, while any verdict episteme is separately governed by C.2.1 and any current identity-inception claim by A.15.PROD.

**Reading guide (one breath).**
* The **promise content** is the consumer-facing outcome and acceptance statement.
* In the A.2.8 **commitment relation**, the accountable-subject position is filled directly and the referents position contains the promise-content clause.
* The **provider role assignment** identifies the holder system, provider role, role-taxonomy episteme, effective reference scheme, and assignment window. The holder system acts under that assignment.
* A.6.P:4.11a recovers the concrete referent or relation denoted by *service* wording. It adds no service-situation participant: provider assignment, access description, access-point system, delivery system, delivery method, promise content, and work occurrence retain their direct kinds and governing patterns; A.10 separately governs the evidence relations.
* **Delivery work** is what happened. Evidence relations support claims about selected facts concerning that occurrence and any post-work state expressed by its selected effect Delta. A system performing evaluation work enacts the declared evaluation method over those facts and states; the actual evaluation operation has its own result binding, and a separately constituted evaluation-result episteme may carry the verdict assertion.

**Litmus rule (addressability).**
If the current claim is about invocation, connection, visitation, restart, or scaling, first use A.6.P:4.11a to recover the exact process, deployed component, endpoint, application, host, cluster, desk, or other bearer. That cue establishes neither `U.System` nor a whole delivery-system boundary. Apply A.1/A.1.SCR only when the repaired claim depends on systemhood; after recognition, call the entity a **service access point** or **service delivery system** only when that exact boundary claim is current. Otherwise keep the exact bearer and keep promise content separate.

### A.2.3:5 - Archetypal grounding (engineer‑manager friendly)

**Worked-case premise.** `E.24.UK` has already admitted the public `U.System` kind. Every exact entity named as a system in the rows below independently satisfies the complete A.1 criterion, including acting eligibility. If that premise cannot be established, keep the exact entity without system membership and stop only the provider-assignment, access-point, delivery-system, or Work-attribution claim that depends on it; other direct claims may continue under their owners.

| Domain | Promise-content episteme | Provider and consumer assignments | Access specification | Delivery work | Evidence and evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud storage | Store and retrieve blobs up to 5 TB under declared criteria—for example, 99.9% availability and 11x9 durability; these values illustrate targets and are not defaults. | `CloudStoragePlatformSystem` holds `StorageProviderRole`; `BackupControllerSystem` holds `StorageConsumerRole`, each through a named A.2.1 assignment occurrence. | `S3ApiDescription-vX`, a `U.MethodDescription`; the endpoint is a separate bearer and is called a `U.System` here only as a worked-case premise independently satisfying A.1. | Dated PUT, GET, replication, and integrity-check Work occurrences participating in `PromiseContentUse`. | Request and integrity observations enter direct evidence relations; actual evaluation applications bind availability or durability results, and separately constituted verdict epistemes state the judgments. |
| Manufacturing utility | Deliver compressed air at 8 bar in Zone B under stated pressure, flow, and purity criteria. | `CompressedAirPlantSystem` holds `UtilityProviderRole`; `LineBSystem` holds `UtilityConsumerRole`. | `ZoneBManifoldAccessDescription`, a `U.MethodDescription`; the manifold is a separate bearer and is called a `U.System` here only as a worked-case premise independently satisfying A.1. | Dated compression and delivery Work occurrences. | Pressure, flow, and purity observations support delivery claims; an actual evaluation application binds the comparison result under the declared scale and window, and a verdict episteme states the judgment. |
| Public passport service | Issue an admissible passport within 20 days under declared defect and eligibility criteria—for example, a ≤ 1% defect target; this value is illustrative, not a default. | `IssuingAgencySystem` holds `PassportIssuerRole`; `ApplicantPersonSystem` holds `PassportApplicantRole`. | `PassportApplicationAccessDescription`, a `U.MethodDescription`; portal and service-desk bearers count as access-point `U.System` values only where this worked case independently assumes the A.1 criterion and that boundary claim is current. | Dated application-handling and passport-issuance Work occurrences. | Submission, issuance, elapsed-time, and defect observations support claims; actual evaluation applications bind lead-time or defect results, and separately constituted verdict epistemes state the judgments. |

**Key takeaway.** The same pattern yields one promise-content episteme in each domain without treating the promise as the provider, access point, method, work occurrence, evidence, operation-result binding, or verdict episteme. Direct role-assignment, `PromiseContentUse`, evaluation-operation, evidence, acceptance, and publication relations retain their own participants and governors; evaluation remains separately performed `U.Work`.

### A.2.3:5.1 - Bias-Annotation

A.2.3 repairs the collapse of several service-related referents into one service label. A visible service name often denotes provider, access point, method, work, commitment, ticket, evidence, and promised outcome without saying which claim is current. The pattern recovers the promise-content episteme first; A.2.8 then governs commitment, A.2.1 provider participation, A.3.2 access description, A.15.1 delivery work, A.10 evidence claims, and the direct outcome and acceptance patterns their respective relations.

In a contract or SLA agreement, an A.2.8 `U.Commitment` may have promise content in its referents position. A contract document, SLA publication, service catalog, API page, or offer publication may be a `U.PresentationCarrier` for `U.EpistemePublication` values describing the agreement, promise content, commitment, or fulfilment work. These relations, epistemes, and carriers retain separate identities.

### A.2.3:6 - Mapping the common “service” picture to FPF (didactic bridge)

A common service diagram is a representation. Recover the represented systems, epistemes, work occurrences, and relation occurrences as follows:

* **Provider participation** -> one named `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence with holder system, provider role value, role-taxonomy episteme, effective reference scheme, and assignment window. The admitted holder system performs each selected delivery-work occurrence under that assignment; when stated as a direct relation, use `performedUnderAssignment(deliveryWork, providerRA)`.
* **Acceptance criterion** -> an evaluation-criterion episteme in `U.PromiseContent.acceptanceSpec`; its target values, verdict scale, and `GammaTimePolicyRef` remain explicit. A `U.WorkPlan` is added only when planned delivery or evaluation work is current.
* **SLA obligation** -> an A.2.8 `U.Commitment` occurrence whose referents position is filled by the relevant `U.PromiseContent`. Use A.6.C when one SLA publication combines wording about commitment, promise content, evidence specification, and publication relations and must be unpacked through its Contract Bundle lens.
* **Published SLA terms** -> the `U.EpistemePublication` for the promise content, together with its `isCarriedBy` relation to a `U.PresentationCarrier`. When publication work also communicates or institutes a commitment, add the named A.2.9 speech-act and A.2.8 commitment relation occurrences; publication alone neither creates the commitment nor establishes fulfilment.
* **Operating conditions** -> the named `U.ClaimScope` under A.2.6. The acceptance specification may cite that scope; it does not replace it.
* **Promised subject** -> resolve `promisedOutcomeSpecRef`, then use the resulting `OutcomeSpec.resultSpec.entityOfConcernRef` together with the exact affected referent, post-work state, and any direct delivery or acceptance relation current for the claim.
* **Customer material—“ours versus theirs.”** -> If the current claim depends on who owns or has custody of data, an asset, or a case, name the exact governed role assignment or ownership/custody relation and its actual participants. Do not make ownership or custody a kernel-global property of `U.PromiseContent`.
* **Access** -> `accessSpec : U.MethodDescription` describes the Method enacted when an eligible consumer holder requests access. Recover the endpoint, desk, manifold, or other exact bearer through A.6.P:4.11a. Its label and addressability establish no `U.System` membership. Apply A.1/A.1.SCR only when a current access-point, delivery-system, performer, or assignment claim depends on systemhood; otherwise keep the bearer claim separate.
* **One `PromiseContentUse` occurrence** -> consumer request work and provider delivery work remain separate occurrences, each attributed through its own `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` relation to a named assignment whose holder system actually performs the work. When request work follows `accessSpec`, its A.15.1 `methodDescriptionRef` resolves to that same `U.MethodDescription`; following the description does not by itself introduce a second relation occurrence. `PromiseContentUse` obtains between selected delivery work and the selected promise-content edition during `PromiseUseIntervalSlot`.
* **Consumer-side changed entity or relation** -> recover the exact affected-referent and actual-transformation facts, plus any local entity-identity-inception, delivery, acceptance, or receiving-use claim that the current promise evaluation needs. If the changed entity is a holder system and its post-work state calls for a new or revised `U.Capability` instance, use A.2.2 for that capability instance and its currentness relations.
* **Service-enabled consumer-side capability or activity** -> If the question is about ability, identify the consumer holder's `U.Capability` instance and state its A.2.2 qualification and currentness claim. If the question is about activity, identify the consumer-side dated `U.Work` under A.15.1. If the claim also says that delivery changed the consumer or was used by that Work, state only the exact actual-change or receiving-use relation that currently obtains; otherwise keep the objects separate. Do not create another U-kind or a generic capability-use relation.
When a domain claim concerns catalog entries, exposure relations, charging relations, or entitlement relations, govern those entries, participants, and relations directly. Relate them to `U.PromiseContent` only through named relations; do not treat them as components of `U.PromiseContent` or replace their direct relations with a locally minted context relation.

### A.2.3:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A2.3‑0 (Prose head phrase).**
In normative prose, an instance of `U.PromiseContent` SHALL be referred to as a **promise content** (or **service offering clause** or **service promise clause**) and SHALL NOT be referenced by the bare head noun *service*. Separately, apply E.10 `L-SERV` and A.6.P:4.11a when *service* or access-like wording occurs in a relied-on FPF claim, recommendation, decision, gate, assurance, publication, or reuse and hides the concrete subject, participant, predicate, kind, permission, Work occurrence, or next route. Quoted, historical, illustrative, and harmless ordinary wording remains outside this recovery rule.

**CC‑A2.3‑1 (Type).**
`U.PromiseContent` **IS** a consumer-facing promise-content `U.Episteme`. One or more `U.EpistemePublication` values may be related to `U.PresentationCarrier` values through `isCarriedBy` without changing the promise-content episteme identity; no presentation carrier is the promise content. `U.PromiseContent` is not a `U.System`, `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.Work`, or `U.WorkPlan`.

**CC-A2.3-2 (Semantic locality).**
Every promise content names its effective `U.ReferenceScheme`, `promisedOutcomeSpecRef`, and `U.ClaimScope` when claim extent matters. Cross-scheme or cross-scope reuse uses the identified F.9 bridge occurrence and A.2.6 scope relations. `modelUseStructureRef` appears only when an independently selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` changes interpretation.
**CC-A2.3-3 (Role values stay distinct from holders and assignments).**
`providerRole` and, when present, `consumerRole` are `U.Role` values interpreted through a named role-taxonomy episteme and effective reference scheme. Actual provider and consumer systems enter through named `U.RoleAssignment` occurrences; a role label alone does not identify a performer.

**CC-A2.3-4 (Acceptance).**
`acceptanceSpec` **MUST** be present and **MUST** define how delivered `U.Work` is judged as pass, fail, or a declared grade against named evaluation criteria and target values. Any SLA deontics are represented through `U.Commitment`. The promise content **MUST** declare **Claim scope (G)** where operating conditions, populations, locales, or another claim extent matter. Every verdict cites an explicit **Gamma_time** window.
If the acceptance criteria mention measurable characteristics such as availability, latency, accuracy, cost, or safety, each characteristic MUST be introduced through C.16 and C.25 with its scale, unit when applicable, `U.DHCMethod` measurement template, and direct evidence relation. If the reading depends on a particular way of measuring, cite the `U.MethodDescription` that describes that measurement method. The characteristic is referenced by its exact identifier rather than by an unqualified KPI label.

**CC‑A2.3‑5 (Access).**
When the promised use relies on a request-facing access Method, `accessSpec` **MUST** identify the A.3.2-admitted `U.MethodDescription` that describes it. Separately recover the endpoint, desk, manifold, or other exact bearer through A.6.P:4.11a. Apply A.1/A.1.SCR only when a current claim depends on that bearer being an access-point `U.System`; otherwise keep the bearer without the stronger claim. If no access-method description is current because access is ambient, `accessSpec` may be omitted. In either branch, keep an eligibility predicate in the promise content when eligibility is promised; when eligibility depends on a separately obtaining admission relation, refer to that relation under its direct owner.

**CC‑A2.3‑6 (Unit of delivery + counting rule).**
When fulfilment work is counted, declare `unitOfDelivery` (for example, one request, kWh, or case). The resulting count may fill a declared quantity position in a separately governed charging relation; that charging relation does not determine the unit-of-delivery specification.
When declared, `unitOfDelivery` **MUST** include a **countingRule** that maps accepted delivery work episodes (`W✓`) to unit counts (A.7:5.10). If omitted, the default is “1 unit per accepted delivery work episode”.

**CC‑A2.3‑7 (No actuals on Promise Content).**
Resource and time actuals belong to the performed `U.Work` occurrence under A.15.1. An incident-log episteme may describe that occurrence and may separately participate in an evidence relation for a stated claim; neither the log nor its participation in that evidence relation fills a `U.PromiseContent` slot.

**CC-A2.3-8 (Provider capability stays separate).**
When delivery depends on provider ability, use the A.2.2 `U.Capability` instance for the provider holder system and the separate capability-fit predicate for the planned delivery work. Do not insert capability into promise-content identity or infer capability or fit from the role name.
**CC-A2.3-9 (Edition and promise-use interval).**
A change to `content`, `promisedOutcomeSpecRef`, or `effectiveReferenceScheme` creates a new promise-content episteme edition under the C.2.1 identity rule. Each `PromiseContentUse` occurrence has one promise-content edition and one delivery-work occurrence as participants and `PromiseUseIntervalSlot` as its temporal qualifier; an untyped `version` or `timespan` entry fills none of those positions.

**CC‑A2.3‑10 (Lexical rule).**
Apply E.10 **L-SERV** and **A.6.P:4.11a** only when *service* or access-like wording occurs in a relied-on FPF claim, recommendation, decision, gate, assurance, publication, or reuse and hides the concrete subject, participant, predicate, kind, permission, Work occurrence, or next route. The author **MUST** name that hidden choice or stop the relied-on use; quoted, historical, illustrative, and harmless ordinary wording is outside this rule.

**CC‑A2.3‑11 (No mereology).**
Do **not** place a promise content clause in PBS or SBS, or treat it as a part or component. Structural assemblies live in PBS and SBS; the promise clause is an episteme (A.2.3). When relied-on *service* wording still hides a concrete referent or relation, recover that hidden choice through A.6.P:4.11a; clear, quoted, historical, illustrative, and harmless ordinary wording creates no additional recovery duty.

**CC-A2.3-12 (Plan, work, and evidence stay distinct).**
Windows and calendars belong to `U.WorkPlan` (A.15.2). Performed delivery belongs to `U.Work` (A.15.1). Evidence epistemes and evidence relations support claims about selected facts concerning that work and any post-work state expressed by its selected effect Delta; they are not slots or parts of the work occurrence.

**CC-A2.3-13 (Claim scope, work scope, and promise-use interval).**
The promise-content episteme names `U.ClaimScope` when its claims are bounded. A provider capability instance names `U.WorkScope`. `PromiseUseIntervalSlot` is the temporal qualifier of each `PromiseContentUse` occurrence. The `ScopeCoverage` predicate is satisfied only when the selected context slice is covered under an explicit `Gamma_time` selector; neither temporal extent nor capability scope replaces claim scope.

**CC-A2.3-14 (Scheme and scope bridges).**
Cross-scheme or cross-scope reuse names the identified F.9 bridge occurrence, direction, loss, and congruence level. A bridge may support a narrower mapped `U.ClaimScope`; it does not mutate the original promise content or create a universal context.
**CC-A2.3-15 (OutcomeSpec typing).**
`promisedOutcomeSpecRef` MUST be a `U.EpistemeRef` resolving to an A.7 `OutcomeSpec` specification-use episteme. It MUST NOT point at a concrete `U.Work` occurrence, affected or delivered entity, actual operation-result binding, verdict episteme, or downstream effect, and `OutcomeSpec` MUST NOT be written as an independently admitted `U.OutcomeSpec`.

**CC-A2.3-16 (OutcomeSpec is explicit and mode‑complete).**
`promisedOutcomeSpecRef` MUST be present and MUST reference an `OutcomeSpec` that declares `mode in {WorkOnly, ResultOnly, Composite}` and satisfies A.7:5.10 mode completeness:
* `WorkOnly` → `workSpec` present, `resultSpec` absent
* `ResultOnly` → `resultSpec` present, `workSpec` absent
* `Composite` → both `workSpec` and `resultSpec` present

**CC-A2.3-17 (OutcomeSpec predicates and delivery-work relations).**
For any delivery `U.Work` occurrence named by `PromiseContentUse`, let `OS` be the A.7 `OutcomeSpec` resolved from `SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef`.

* If `OS.workSpec` is present, the selected facts about the work occurrence satisfy `OS.workSpec.workPredicateRef`; when `methodConstraintRef` is present, the enacted method is compatible with that constraint.
* If `OS.resultSpec` is present, the exact affected referent and post-work state expressed by the selected effect Delta satisfy `OS.resultSpec.postConditionRef` on its declared state plane; any production, delivery, acceptance, or receiving-use claim remains separately governed.
* A.10 evidence relations obtain between each relied-on satisfaction assertion and its supporting evidence epistemes. Those evidence epistemes are neither delivery-work occurrences, affected or delivered entities, operation-result bindings, verdict epistemes, nor values of `OutcomeSpec.workSpec` or `OutcomeSpec.resultSpec`.

Explicitly individuate `PromisedOutcomeDeliveryRelation` only when a downstream relation or claim must refer to its occurrence identity and only after these mode-specific conditions are established; otherwise retain the readable `deliversPromisedOutcome(W, OS)` assertion.
**CC-A2.3-18 (Acceptance evaluation supports rather than constitutes fulfilment).**
A holder system performs evaluation work by the evaluation method described in `acceptanceSpec` over the same selected work facts and post-work states used to test delivery under `SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef`. The actual evaluation-operation application carries its exact argument and result bindings. When a durable verdict episteme is needed, C.2.1 governs its identity and A.15.PROD governs any current entity-identity-inception claim. That episteme may assert an admitted fulfilment verdict only when the selected work facts and post-work state satisfy the acceptance criteria. A.10 evidence relations support the relied-on assertions; the operation-result binding, verdict episteme, and evidence relations support knowledge of `PromiseContentFulfilmentRelation` but do not make it obtain. A multi-grade verdict-scale description states how non-delivery is represented.

**CC-A2.3-19 (OutcomeSpec ↔ unitOfDelivery coherence).**
If `unitOfDelivery` is present, its counting rule states a `selectorRef` that selects only work occurrences eligible to satisfy `SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef` in the declared mode. When one occurrence can fulfil several promise contents, the rule states either `dedupeKeyRef` or a reference to a counting-policy episteme under its direct governing pattern. A selector may denote work occurrences filling `FulfilmentWorkOccurrenceSlot` in obtaining `PromiseContentFulfilmentRelation` occurrences; it does not count work for which fulfilment has not been established.

**CC-A2.3-20 (Unit-of-delivery is computable from work facts).**
If `unitOfDelivery` is present, it MUST declare its counting rule over selected facts about fulfilment work, cite the `U.DHCMethod` used for any measurement reading, name the `U.MethodDescription` when a particular measurement method constrains that reading, state evidence-admissibility conditions, and refer to the evidence epistemes and A.10 evidence relations used, per A.7:5.10.3. The default "1 unit per fulfilment work occurrence" is permitted only for a pure count of fulfilment occurrences.

### A.2.3:8 - Promise-content use, delivery, evaluation, and evidence

Keep `PromiseContentUse`, `PromisedOutcomeDeliveryRelation`, evaluation `U.Work`, the actual evaluation-operation application and result binding, any verdict episteme, and A.10 evidence relations separate. A direct relation may obtain even when the current episteme about it is unresolved; evidence supports the claim and does not become the relation.

#### A.2.3:8.1 - Core relations

**`PromiseContentUse : U.Relation`.** This direct use relation obtains between one delivery-work occurrence and one promise-content edition during one named promise-use interval; it makes no fulfilment claim.

```text
PromiseContentUse : U.Relation
  DeliveryWorkOccurrenceSlot: U.Work, U.EntityRef
  PromiseContentSlot: U.PromiseContent, U.EpistemeRef
  PromiseUseIntervalSlot: temporal interval, byValue
```

Its occurrence key is `<DeliveryWorkOccurrenceSlot, PromiseContentSlot, PromiseUseIntervalSlot>`. Obtaining of this relation implies neither successful delivery nor intention, judgement, or claim-making by either participant.

**`PromisedOutcomeDeliveryRelation : U.Relation`.** This derived relation obtains between one delivery-work occurrence and the A.7 `OutcomeSpec` resolved from the `PromiseContentUse` occurrence in which that work participates, when the conditions below hold.

```text
PromisedOutcomeDeliveryRelation : U.Relation
  DeliveryWorkOccurrenceSlot: U.Work, U.EntityRef
  PromisedOutcomeSpecificationSlot: U.Episteme, U.EpistemeRef constrained to A.7 OutcomeSpec
```

The relation obtains only when one `PromiseContentUse` occurrence has the delivery work and a promise-content edition as participants, that edition's `promisedOutcomeSpecRef` resolves to the same `OutcomeSpec`, and the specification's mode-specific conditions hold. When `workSpec` is present, selected work facts satisfy `workSpec.workPredicateRef`. When `resultSpec` is present, the exact affected referent and post-work state expressed by the selected effect Delta satisfy `resultSpec.postConditionRef`; any current production, delivery, or acceptance relation remains separately governed. Its occurrence key is `<DeliveryWorkOccurrenceSlot, PromisedOutcomeSpecificationSlot>`. The readable predicate is `deliversPromisedOutcome(W, OS)`, where `OS` denotes that resolved `OutcomeSpec`. An episteme may assert that this relation obtains, and evidence may support that assertion; neither the assertion nor the evidence makes the work facts or post-work state satisfy the specification.

**Acceptance evaluation result.** A holder system performs evaluation `U.Work` by the evaluation method described in `acceptanceSpec`, using the same selected facts about delivery work and post-work states. The actual evaluation-operation application carries exact argument bindings and the verdict value in its declared result binding. When another use needs a durable evaluation-result episteme, C.2.1 governs that episteme, and A.15.PROD governs any current identity-inception claim linking exact work, actual change, and episteme identity. A.10 evidence relations support the relied-on assertions. The promise content does not perform the evaluation or compute the verdict; the operation-result binding, result episteme, and evidence relations support the assertion rather than making the fulfilment relation obtain.

**`PromiseContentFulfilmentRelation : U.Relation`.** This derived relation obtains between one delivery-work occurrence and one promise-content edition when the conditions below hold.

```text
PromiseContentFulfilmentRelation : U.Relation
  FulfilmentWorkOccurrenceSlot: U.Work, U.EntityRef
  FulfilledPromiseContentSlot: U.PromiseContent, U.EpistemeRef
```

The semantic predicate for this relation is satisfied only when `PromiseContentUse` obtains for the same work and promise-content participants, `PromisedOutcomeDeliveryRelation` obtains for that work and the `OutcomeSpec` resolved from that promise content, and the acceptance predicate declared by `acceptanceSpec` is satisfied for the exact delivery-work facts, affected or delivered entities, post-work state, and any direct delivery or acceptance relation required by the criterion. `PromiseContentFulfilmentRelation` obtains for the declared participants when that semantic predicate is satisfied. Its occurrence key is `<FulfilmentWorkOccurrenceSlot, FulfilledPromiseContentSlot>`. The readable predicate is `fulfilsPromiseContent(W, SC)`. A later evaluation may change the supported assertion about whether the relation obtains; it does not change relation identity. When satisfaction of any required predicate is unresolved, no positive fulfilment assertion is available for reliance.

The explicit `RelationSignature` declarations are warranted only when `unitOfDelivery` selectors or fulfilment measures refer to relation-occurrence identity. Ordinary prose may stop at the readable predicates when no later relation refers to that occurrence identity.

> **Invariant:** `fulfilsPromiseContent(W, SC)` implies `PromiseContentUse(W, SC, T)`, `deliversPromisedOutcome(W, resolve(SC.promisedOutcomeSpecRef))`, and satisfaction of the acceptance criteria declared in `SC.acceptanceSpec`; an evaluation-result episteme and A.10 evidence relations support the corresponding assertion without becoming relation participants.
> **Invariant:** One work occurrence can fulfil several promise contents only when each promise content's counting rule states `dedupeKeyRef` or refers to a counting-policy episteme under its direct governing pattern; no silent double counting.

#### A.2.3:8.2 - Promise-content delivery measures

Let `W(SC, T)` be the set of delivery-work occurrences for which `PromiseContentUse` obtains with `SC` during interval `T`. Let `W✓(SC, T)` be the subset for which `PromiseContentFulfilmentRelation` obtains with `SC`.

* **Delivered units:** `delivered(SC, T)` is computed from the set `W✓(SC, T)` using `unitOfDelivery`’s **countingRule** (A.7:5.10). Default (when `unitOfDelivery` is absent): `delivered(SC, T) = |W✓(SC, T)|` (one unit per accepted delivery work).
* **Rejection rate:** `rejectRate(SC, T) = 1 − |W✓(SC,T)| / |W(SC,T)|` (declare handling of `partial`).
* **Lead time:** declare the characteristic definition and aggregation separately. The definition may use work duration or request-to-completion delta; the aggregation may use an average or named percentile.
* **Availability and uptime claims:** select one declared characteristic instead of treating the labels as synonyms. Derive its observed characteristic value from selected work facts and telemetry observations through its C.16 measurement template, `Gamma_time` policy, and evidence relations; cite a `U.MethodDescription` when a particular measurement method affects the reading.
* **Cost‑to‑serve:** sum of `Γ_work` over `W✓` per resource category (A.15.1).

Each resulting `U.Measure` claim is derived from selected facts about `U.Work` occurrences through its C.16 measurement template and named A.10 evidence relations; when a particular measurement method matters, its `U.MethodDescription` is cited. The promise-content episteme is never the bearer of resource or time actuals.
Aggregation across time uses the `Gamma_time` policy referenced by the named C.16 measurement template or acceptance specification; an unqualified KPI label does not select that policy. When a measure needs a B.1.4 temporal-phase aggregation of one carrier, name one `ContextTemporalAggregation@Context` record and its exact selected policy—for example, union of observed values or their convex hull—together with carrier identity, time window, coverage and non-overlap conditions, and admissible use. If those one-carrier conditions do not hold, return to the direct aggregation owner instead of using this example. Union and convex hull are policy choices, not defaults; `Gamma_time` does not select either by itself.

### A.2.3:9 - Common misclassification repairs

* **A microservice label is being used for the whole service claim.** Use A.6.P:4.11a to recover whether the source word denotes service-provision Work, a Method, PromiseContent, provider participation, or an exact deployed process, component, endpoint, application, host, or cluster. Apply A.1/A.1.SCR only when a repaired bearer claim depends on systemhood. Deployment and the label establish neither membership nor a delivery-system/access-point boundary; the consumer-facing outcome and acceptance claims remain in `U.PromiseContent`.
* **An API label is being used for the whole service claim.** If the referent is an interface specification, use the exact episteme and `U.MethodDescription` only when A.3.2 admits it. If it is an addressable endpoint, recover that bearer through A.6.P:4.11a and apply A.1/A.1.SCR only when a current claim depends on systemhood. Neither the API label nor addressability establishes membership, and neither referent is the promise-content episteme.
* **A process or procedure label is being used for the whole service claim.** Recover the semantic way of doing as `U.Method`, its description as `U.MethodDescription`, planned work as `U.WorkPlan`, and performed occurrences as `U.Work`. Keep the promised outcome and acceptance claims in `U.PromiseContent`.
* **A ticket or case record is being used for the whole service claim.** Recover its claim-bearing content as a ticket or case-description `U.Episteme`; keep the publication form and `U.PresentationCarrier` separate. Relate that episteme to the named `U.WorkPlan` or `U.Work` occurrence it describes.
* **Cost or elapsed time is attached to the promise content.** Keep resource and time actuals on the performed `U.Work` occurrence. Derive a measure over work occurrences participating in `PromiseContentUse` only through its declared characteristic, C.16 measurement template, named A.10 evidence relations, aggregation rule, and `Gamma_time` policy; cite a `U.MethodDescription` when a particular measurement method affects the reading.
* **Promise content is placed in a product or system breakdown.** Keep the promise content as an episteme. The access and delivery systems may have parts and selected structures under A.22 and C.30; the promise-content episteme is not one of those parts.
* **A person or organization name is stored as the provider role.** State the `U.Role` value and role-taxonomy scheme in the promise content. If an actual provider-assignment claim is current, identify the exact person or organization and apply A.1 because A.2.1 requires an admitted holder `U.System`; otherwise do not create the assignment. Then state the named `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence and explicit assignment window.

### A.2.3:10 - Existing promise-description repair applications

1. **Name the promises.** As an informative first pass, list roughly 5–15 consumer-facing promises used by the project; the range is a prompt, not an admission threshold. Represent each as `U.PromiseContent` with effective reference scheme, promised outcome specification, acceptance specification, and claim scope, plus access specification and unit of delivery when current.
2. **Separate provider from promise content.** Recover each exact provider, access-point, or delivery bearer through A.6.P:4.11a. Apply A.1/A.1.SCR only where a current provider-assignment, access-point, delivery-system, performer, or other claim depends on systemhood. Then connect a recognized provider holder through a named A.2.1 role assignment only when that participation fact is current.
3. **Relate promise content to delivery and evidence.** Add `PromiseContentUse` for every delivery-work occurrence evaluated under the promise. Establish `PromisedOutcomeDeliveryRelation` only after exact work facts, affected or delivered entities, post-work states, and any direct delivery relation required by the resolved `OutcomeSpec` satisfy it; establish `PromiseContentFulfilmentRelation` only after those facts and states satisfy the declared acceptance criteria. Record the actual evaluation-operation result binding, any evaluation-result episteme, the evidence epistemes it cites, and the A.10 evidence relations separately.
4. **Define evaluation characteristics.** As an informative first pass, select roughly 2–4 characteristics for each promise content; the range is a prompt, not a conformance limit. Use a recognizable §8.2 formula family—availability over a named window, lead time as a declared delta plus aggregation, rejection rate `1 − |W✓| / |W|`, or cost-to-serve as summed Work resource use—or state an exact declared alternative. For each characteristic, name its scale, unit when applicable, C.16 measurement template, `Gamma_time` policy, direct evidence relations, and exact formula; cite a `U.MethodDescription` when a particular measurement method affects the reading. Do not let a KPI label stand in for this declaration.
5. **Bridge domain schemes.** If a domain ontology distinguishes business, technical, or internal service kinds and relations, retain its reference scheme and name the F.9 bridge occurrence for each selected domain referent and FPF counterpart; source classes confer no FPF systemhood.
6. **Tidy relied-on language.** Apply **L-SERV** and **A.6.P:4.11a** only when *service* or access-like wording hides a concrete subject, participant, predicate, kind, permission, Work occurrence, or next route in the current relied-on use. Name that exact choice and its direct owner, or stop the use; use A.1/A.1.SCR only when a recovered bearer claim depends on systemhood. Reserve `U.PromiseContent` for the consumer-facing promise content, and leave clear, quoted, historical, illustrative, and harmless ordinary wording outside this step.

### A.2.3:10.1 - Consequences

| Consequence | Benefit | Cost or boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Promise content becomes explicit | Evaluation work can apply declared acceptance criteria to exact delivery-work facts, affected or delivered entities, post-work states, and any direct delivery or acceptance relation required by the criterion. | The promise-content declaration and its direct relations must keep provider, access point, method, ticket or case-description episteme, work occurrence, operation-result binding, evidence episteme, evidence relation, and evaluation-result episteme distinct. |
| Commitments stay distinct | A promise-content clause can be referred to from `U.Commitment` without becoming the deontic commitment relation itself. | Accountability still needs an A.2.8 commitment occurrence whose accountable-subject position is filled, plus any current A.2.9 speech-act relation. |
| Promise use and evaluation become replayable | `PromiseContentUse` obtains between the work occurrence and promise-content edition during the promise-use interval; delivery and fulfilment remain separate derived relations. | A downstream fulfilment assertion retains the exact work, affected-subject and delivery facts, selected Delta expression when used, evaluation-operation result binding, named evidence epistemes and A.10 evidence relations, evaluation method description, and any evaluation-result episteme instead of treating the work occurrence or a dashboard as sufficient support. |

### A.2.3:10.2 - Rationale

Everyday "service" language is useful because one label can denote promise content, provider systems, access points, commitments, methods, work occurrences, and evidence epistemes. When those claims guide evaluation or work, FPF distinguishes the referents and states their direct relations. `U.PromiseContent` gives the promised-outcome side one stable episteme, A.6.P:4.11a recovers the referent intended by the service wording, and each named direct relation remains governed by its direct pattern.

The pattern keeps promise content in the episteme family because it is a clause or description whose outcome and acceptance predicates state conditions on delivery work, affected referents, and post-work states. A fulfilment assertion and the evidence relations supporting it remain distinct from those referents and from the world-side relations whose obtaining the assertion describes. The episteme never becomes an obligation: the referents position of an A.2.8 commitment relation may contain it, an A.2.9 speech-act occurrence may communicate or institute that commitment, and A.6.C may unpack contract or SLA wording carried by a publication, while gate and policy relations remain separate.

### A.2.3:10.3 - SoTA-Echoing

Service-management, product, utility, platform, and public-service practice all distinguish offers, providers, access channels, service levels, work execution, and evidence of fulfilment, even when everyday language calls all of them "the service". A.2.3 keeps that practical distinction in FPF by giving the consumer-facing promise clause its own episteme value and by returning provider, access, commitment, work, and evidence claims to their governing patterns.

Contract and SLA practice distinguishes promised content from obligation-bearing acts or agreements and from later performance evidence. FPF keeps that separation without importing a domain-specific service taxonomy; the promise-content episteme remains usable across IT, utilities, healthcare, public services, manufacturing support, and other project domains.

### A.2.3:11 - Relations

* **Builds on:** C.2.1 `U.Episteme` identity and reference scheme; A.2 `U.Role`; A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment`; A.2.2 `U.Capability`; and A.2.6 `U.ClaimScope` and `U.WorkScope`. A.1.1 is used only when an independently selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` changes interpretation.
* **Coordinates with:** A.3.1 `U.Method`; A.3.2 `U.MethodDescription`; A.15.1 `U.Work`; A.6.1 for actual operation application and result binding; A.15.PROD for current entity-identity-inception claims; A.15.2 `U.WorkPlan`; direct affected-subject, delivery, acceptance, and evaluation patterns; A.10 for evidence relations; A.2.8 for commitment; A.2.9 for speech act; A.6.P:4.11a for service-wording restoration; F.9 for cross-scheme or cross-scope bridges; and A.7 plus the direct publication pattern when specification use or publication is current.
* **Constrained by lexical rules:** **E.10 L‑SERV** (service disambiguation); also **L‑FUNC**, **L‑PROC**, **L‑SCHED**, **L‑ACT**.
* **Informs:** reporting and assurance patterns for measures over work occurrences participating in `PromiseContentUse`, plus directly governed catalog entries, exposure relations, charging relations, and entitlement relations when those claims are current.

### A.2.3:12 - Didactic quick distinctions

* **Promise content.** A consumer-facing episteme stating the promised outcome, any eligibility predicate, effective reference scheme, claim scope, and acceptance specification; its optional `accessSpec` describes the access method.
* **Method and method description.** `U.Method` is the semantic way of doing. `U.MethodDescription` is an episteme describing that method; neither is delivery work.
* **Delivery work, affected subject, and effect Delta.** A provider holder system performs `U.Work`. Exact affected-referent, actual-change, production, delivery, or acceptance claims state what happened under their own governors; the selected effect Delta is a mathematical-lens expression over the affected referent and its pre-work and post-work states.
* **Evidence and evaluation.** Evidence relations support delivery and satisfaction claims. A separately performed evaluation occurrence has an actual operation application with a declared result binding; any verdict episteme is separately constituted and governed.
* **Provider and consumer participation.** `U.Role` values denote participation positions; the role-taxonomy episteme describes their meanings, and the holder-system and assignment-window positions of named `U.RoleAssignment` occurrences are filled explicitly.
* **Measures.** `U.Measure` claims such as availability or lead-time readings derive from selected work facts through named characteristics, C.16 measurement templates, A.10 evidence relations, aggregation rules, and temporal policies; when a particular measurement method matters, its `U.MethodDescription` is cited.
* **Structure boundary.** Promise content is not a structural part. The systems that expose access or perform delivery retain their own parts, selected structures, and `ArchitectureOf@Context` relations.
