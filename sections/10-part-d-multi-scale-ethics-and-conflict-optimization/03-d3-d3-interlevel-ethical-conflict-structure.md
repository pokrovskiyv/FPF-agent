## D.3 - Interlevel Ethical Conflict Structure

> **Type:** D-family ethical conflict-structure pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Pattern role:** This compact pattern defines the structure of an interlevel ethical conflict. Use D.4 for mediation and decision use, D.5 for bias, fairness, impact, and ethical assurance, C.28 for causal claims, and C.30.ILC for architecture residuals.

**Use this when.** Use this pattern when an ethical conflict spans declared levels or scopes and the conflict structure itself must be made inspectable before mediation, decision, assurance, or architecture return.

**Not this pattern when.** If only the ethical value frame is missing, use `D.1`. If only entry recognition is needed, use `D.2`. If the conflict structure is already mapped and the current question is mediation or decision use, use `D.4`. If the question is bias, fairness, impact audit, causal-fairness audit consumption, or ethical assurance, use `D.5`.

**What goes wrong if missed.** The team debates values or decisions before it has named the levels or scopes, carriers, harms, benefits, evidence, and residuals that actually conflict.

**What this buys.** The conflict becomes an inspectable structure that `D.4`, `D.5`, assurance, causal, and architecture patterns can use without guessing.

### D.3:1 - Problem Frame

Interlevel ethical conflict is not just disagreement between people. It may involve a system part and a whole, a person and an organization, one organization and a community, a project and a society, a collection and its members, an episteme family and the decisions it shapes, or an architecture move and the holon levels it affects.

The central move is structural: name what is in conflict, at which declared levels or scopes, through which Methods, actual Work, transformations, evidence, value concerns, and consequence horizons. Recover role wording through `E.10.ROLE`; keep any local kind, separate System-classification judgment, assignment, agency threshold, responsibility, commitment, permission, authority, or participation relation distinct. Do not turn the conflict into publication wording, assurance claim, or architecture residual unless that is the current object.

### D.3:1.0 - Problem

Interlevel ethical conflict is often debated before it is structured. The failure is to argue over values or decisions while the affected objects, declared levels or scopes, value frames, methods, work, transformations, evidence, uncertainty, thresholds, and consequence horizons remain implicit.

### D.3:1.1 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Conflict structure vs. decision use | The conflict must be inspectable before D.4 can mediate, refuse, or authorize a bounded decision. |
| Level and scope plurality vs. fixed ladder | The case may involve persons, teams, organizations, communities, systems, epistemes, or environments without one universal hierarchy. |
| Ethical object vs. representation | Tables, graphs, narratives, and formal predicates can describe a conflict, but are not the conflict itself. |
| Agency threshold vs. responsibility relation | Evidence may support an agency characteristic or threshold. Responsibility still needs its independently obtaining direct predicate and participants; no agency score or label supplies it. |
| Architecture residual vs. ethical conflict | A cross-scope structure can be architectural, ethical, or both. Use `C.30.ILC` to triage the architecture residual and D.3 to record the ethical conflict structure; when both apply, keep both claims explicit. |

### D.3:2 - Solution

Record an `InterlevelEthicalConflictStructure`:

```text
InterlevelEthicalConflictStructure:
  conflictConcernRef
  claimScopeRef?
  affectedEntityOfConcernRefs
  declaredLevelOrScopeRefs
  affectedHolonRefs
  affectedEpistemeRefs?
  collectionOrMembershipRelationRefs?
  partWholeRelationRefs?
  roleWordRecoveryRefs?: E.10.ROLE results when role wording occurs
  localSystemRoleKindRefs?: FinSet(U.KindRef)
  systemRoleClassificationJudgmentRefs?: FinSet(U.RelationRef)
  systemRoleAssignmentRows?: FinSet({
    assignmentSpeciesRef: U.RelationKindRef constrained under U.SystemRoleAssignment
    assignmentOccurrenceRef: U.RelationRef constrained to an obtaining occurrence of assignmentSpeciesRef, with actual participants, holder, applicability, and extent recoverable
  })
  interestOrConcernRefs
  valueFrameRefs
  agencyCharacteristicOrThresholdRefs?
  responsibilityRelationRefs?: exact direct responsibility predicates with participants and occurrence identity
  responsibilityMissingGovernorRefs?: exact A.6.RCD results
  otherEthicalRelationRows?: FinSet({
    relationFamilyRef: exact admitted direct-relation family other than responsibility
    relationRef?: exact obtaining occurrence of that family
    missingGovernorRef?: exact A.6.RCD result for that family
  })
  methodOrWorkRefs?
  transformationRefs?
  evidenceRefs
  uncertaintyRefs
  consequenceHorizonRefs
  conflictRelationRefs
  nonConflictOverread
  nextUseQuestionRef
```

This structure may be represented by a table, graph, formal predicate, narrative case, or another selected description form. The representation is not the conflict itself. If a mathematical lens does work in the claim, cite `C.29`; if the publication form changes admissible use, cite `E.17`.

### D.3:3 - Collection and Episteme Cases

A collection is ethically current only when whole-level characteristics, membership relations, environment-mediated effects, or aggregate consequences matter. Use `A.14` for part-whole and membership relation vocabulary and `C.13` for constructive grounding. Do not assign responsibility to a collection merely because it has a plural name.

An episteme is ethically current when its claim-bearing structure, source-use relation, publication relation, described EntityOfConcern, or model family changes affected systems or decisions. Use C.2.1 for episteme identity and for the exact constitution, empirical-grounding, or edition relation that the claim actually uses, and E.17 for publication claims. Do not turn every ethical conflict over a theory, standard, architecture description, or policy description into a problem about wording.

### D.3:4 - Boundaries

| Do this in D.3 | Do not do this in D.3 |
| --- | --- |
| State the declared levels or scopes that make the conflict interlevel. | Invent `U.Level`, `U.Frustration`, or `U.Emergence`. |
| Name affected holons, Systems, epistemes, collections, Methods, actual Work, transformations, evidence, and value concerns. Recover role wording through `E.10.ROLE`, and keep local kind, System-classification judgment, assignment species and occurrence, agency threshold, responsibility, commitment, permission, authority, and participation separate. | Treat a source label such as "society", "organization", "AI", "ecosystem", "role", or "standard" as enough. |
| Keep conflict structure separate from mediation and decision use. | Choose the compromise, refusal, or override. |
| Use `C.30.ILC for architecture residuals` when architecture structure is current. | Route every cross-scope architecture problem to ethics. |
| Use `D.5 for bias, fairness, impact audit, and ethical assurance`. | Rebuild D.5 inside the conflict map. |

### D.3:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Worked Slices)

**Engineering advice.** A consultant improves the effectiveness of a client's harmful project. The conflict is not only "bad client, good Method." `D.3` maps the consultant and client Systems, affected public, Method, actual Work when it occurred, any separately obtaining assignment, agency evidence, and consequence horizon. A responsibility claim is admitted only through its direct predicate and participants; otherwise the case records `missing-governor`. `D.4` handles refusal, conditions, escalation, or decision use.

**Collection case.** A fleet-level optimization reduces maintenance cost but increases failure risk for a small subfleet used in harsher conditions. `D.3` names the fleet, subfleet, membership relation, any acting collective system, affected users, evidence set, value concerns, responsibility relations, and consequence horizon separately. Collection membership alone makes neither the fleet a responsible acting whole nor the subfleet its part under another relation. Use A.1 to test systemhood, A.14 for a part-whole claim, and the exact responsibility predicate with its actual participants for a responsibility claim.

**Episteme case.** A published architecture description normalizes an interface assumption that excludes an alternative implementation option. The ethical conflict may involve the episteme whole, its source-use relation, affected suppliers, and system consequences. `D.3` maps the conflict; use C.30.AD's architecture-description adequacy rules and E.17's publication-use rules for those separate claims.

### D.3:5.1 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias risk | Failure | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debate replaces structure | The team argues about values before naming the affected objects and relations. | Fill the conflict structure before mediation. |
| Representation becomes conflict | A diagram, matrix, or narrative is treated as the ethical conflict itself. | Separate the conflict EntityOfConcern from the selected description form. |
| Collective name becomes responsibility | Organization, society, public, market, or AI is treated as responsible by label. | Name the holon or collection, membership or participation relation, optional local kind, separate System-classification judgment, any assignment species and occurrence, agency characteristic or threshold, and evidence. Cite the direct responsibility predicate and participants or return `missing-governor`; none of the preceding facts creates responsibility. |
| Architecture absorbs ethics | Cross-scope residual wording hides value, harm, responsibility, or admissible sacrifice. | Use A.22 and the applicable C.30 rule for a selected structure or architecture claim; use D.3 and D.4 when ethical conflict is current. |

### D.3:6 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CC-D3-1 | The conflict names affected EntityOfConcern refs, declared levels or scopes, value frames, evidence, and consequence horizons. | Makes the conflict structure inspectable. |
| CC-D3-2 | Episteme identity uses C.2.1; part-whole claims use A.14; Method uses A.3.1; dated Work uses A.15.1; transformation uses A.3.4. Collection membership and every other relation need their own direct predicate and actual participants. | Prevents ethical conflict from absorbing ontology. |
| CC-D3-3 | `nextUseQuestionRef` points to D.4 for mediation or decision use, D.5 for bias, fairness, impact, or ethical assurance, C.28 for causal use, and C.30.ILC for an architecture residual. | Keeps D.3 separate from neighboring questions. |
| CC-D3-4 | The representation of the conflict is not treated as the conflict itself. | Prevents semio-bias in ethical conflict maps. |

### D.3:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What goes wrong | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Political label as structure | The conflict is named by a slogan such as society versus innovation. | Name the affected EntityOfConcern refs, levels or scopes, value frames, and evidence. |
| Actor by plural noun | A collection is made responsible because its name is plural or institutional. | Recover membership, part-whole, participation, optional assignment, and agency evidence separately. Cite a direct responsibility relation with exact participants or return `missing-governor`. |
| Description-only conflict | The case becomes a problem about wording of a report, model, or standard. | Use C.2.1 for episteme identity and E.17 or E.24.PUB for publication use while D.3 maps the affected systems or decisions. |
| Mediation inside map | The conflict map chooses the compromise. | Stop at structure; D.4 is the pattern for mediation or decision use. |

### D.3:7 - Consequences

This pattern gives `D.4`, `D.5`, `B.3`, `C.28`, `A.10`, `C.11`, and `C.30.ILC` a conflict structure they can use without stealing the ethical object. The cost is that conflicts cannot be waved through by a slogan. The gain is that mediation and decision work start from a typed structure rather than from a politically convenient label.

### D.3:9 - Rationale

`D.3` provides the typed structure that ethical mediation, assurance, causal, architecture, and bias-audit methods can use. Without it, a D.4 mediation assertion has slogans rather than inspectable conflicts; a D.5 fairness assertion lacks affected scopes; an architecture assertion receives value conflict disguised as residual; and an evidence assertion lacks a declared consequence horizon.

The pattern therefore focuses on the conflict EntityOfConcern: affected objects, declared levels or scopes, value frames, Methods, actual Work, transformations, evidence, uncertainty, agency thresholds, direct responsibility and other ethical relations, and consequence horizons. Any role-like source wording is recovered before those fields are filled. It keeps descriptions of the conflict useful but secondary.

### D.3:10 - SoTA-Echoing

| Source line | Practical implication for this pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Multilevel ethics and systems thinking | Ethical conflict often crosses declared levels or scopes through Methods, actual Work, transformations, participation, evidence, value concerns, and consequence horizons; the case must show which relations actually conflict. |
| Collective agency and responsibility debates | Collection, organization, public, or community names require grounding in holon, membership or participation, an independently optional local kind, a separate optional System-classification judgment, any obtaining assignment, agency evidence, and a direct responsibility predicate before responsibility is asserted. |
| Constructive and episteme ontology | Conflicts can involve, for example, systems, collections, work occurrences, disciplines, epistemes, or the exact practice boundaries and model-use structures current in the case. Use C.2.1 for episteme identity and E.17 or E.24.PUB for publication claims; the forms remain only their forms, not substitutes for affected EntityOfConcern. |
| FPF architecture-residual discipline | Cross-scope architecture residual and interlevel ethical conflict can coincide; Use D.3 to map the ethical conflict and `C.30.ILC` to triage the architecture residual. |

### D.3:11 - Relations

- Builds on `D.1` and `D.2` for value-frame boundary and multilevel entry.
- Builds on `A.1`, `A.14`, `B.1`, and `C.13` for holons, part-whole, membership, collections, and constructive grounding.
- Coordinates with `D.4` for mediation and decision use.
- Coordinates with `D.5` for bias, fairness, impact audit, causal-fairness audit consumption, and ethical assurance.
- Coordinates with `C.2.1` and `E.17` for episteme and publication-use claims.
- Coordinates with `C.30.ILC`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `C.28`, and `C.29` when architecture residual, evidence, assurance, causal, or mathematical-lens claims are current.
