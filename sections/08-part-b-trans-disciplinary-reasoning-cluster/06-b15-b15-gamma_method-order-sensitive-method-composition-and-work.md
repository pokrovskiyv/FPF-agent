## B.1.5 - Gamma_method - Order-Sensitive Method Composition and Work Enactment

> **Type:** Part B composition and grounding pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless a section is explicitly informative

### B.1.5:1 - Problem Frame

Use this pattern when a project must decide whether several recovered methods compose into one larger `U.Method`, and when order, guarded choice, parallel branches, typed joins, adapters, or method-interface exposure changes the identity of that whole method.

Typical moments:

- a procedure, workflow, algorithm, pipeline, proof route, clinical protocol, manufacturing recipe, inference pipeline, or operational playbook has named steps or branches;
- changing the order of two candidate submethods changes the result or the admissible conditions of use;
- a diagram or code file looks like a method, but it may be only a method description, a work plan, a dated work trace, a selector registry, or a mathematical lens;
- a larger method must expose some interactions at its boundary while hiding internal steps;
- assurance needs to know which joins, adapters, cutsets, or exposed interfaces make the composite method reliable enough to enact.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** The EntityOfConcern is one exact candidate or composite `U.Method`, already identified under A.3.1. The proposition that exact part Methods and whole-forming facts qualify it as composite is separately governed claim content. A separately identified C.2.1 episteme may carry that proposition in its ClaimGraph; the episteme then has the exact candidate Method as its EntityOfConcern under its effective ReferenceScheme. The proposition does not become the episteme.

**First useful move.** For each apparent step or branch, recover the governed object before composing anything: `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.WorkPlan`, dated `U.Work`, an A.22-selected `U.Structure`, method-family registry or selector outcome, mathematical lens, mechanism, formal substrate, or quoted wording that does not yet carry a method claim.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A flowchart becomes the method, a plan item becomes a submethod, an event log becomes proof that a method was enacted, an order edge becomes a part, or a registry of alternatives is treated as one composed method. Then work starts from a description or label whose method identity, joins, interfaces, and failure conditions were never recovered.

**What this buys.** The project can test whether an already identified candidate `U.Method` is composite and can state the needed part, order, join, interface, and identity facts without turning every useful sentence into a relation kind. If that qualification fails, the project still has a useful lower object: an A.22-selected `U.Structure`, description, plan, work occurrence, lens, selector result, or `A.15.4` appearance-based reliance repair request.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If the current claim is one semantic way of doing with no order-sensitive composition question, use `A.3.1`.
- If the current claim is a claim-bearing episteme that describes a method or relations among methods, use `A.3.2` and `C.2.1`.
- If the current claim is intended work, use `A.15.2`.
- If the current claim is a dated occurrence, use `A.15.1`.
- If the current claim is structural component parthood, use `A.14`, `C.13`, and `B.3.5`.
- If the current claim is only a method-family registry, selector, fallback relation, or useful organization of already identified methods without one whole-method construction, use `G.5` or select a `U.Structure` under `A.22`.

#### B.1.5:1.1 - Composition Question And Object Boundaries

`U.Method` is a non-agentive method holon kind. A method can have submethods and can participate as a submethod in a larger method. This does not mean every step-looking node, document section, file module, graph edge, work-plan item, or work occurrence is a method part.

Order-sensitive method composition is a narrow constructive question:

```text
Given independently recovered U.Method parts,
which methodPartOf occurrences, exact whole-forming claims, and constraints qualify one already identified candidate as composite,
and what whole-level commitments let a practitioner identify, reidentify, and enact that method?
```

The whole method is not the diagram, code, schedule, event log, card, or work history that may describe, plan, record, or evidence it. Work enacts the method; the method does not perform work. An A.22-selected `U.Structure` may organize several methods and obtaining relations for one use without constructing another method.

`Gamma_method` is the name for this method-composition discipline. It is not a new root U-kind, not a workflow notation, not a generic container, not a resource-accounting operator, and not a substitute for `U.Work`.

### B.1.5:2 - Problem

Without B.1.5:

1. **Source-wording composition.** "Step", "stage", "activity", "task", "procedure", "workflow", "pipeline", or "algorithm" wording is accepted as method composition without recovering the actual objects.
2. **Description-as-method.** A workflow diagram, BPMN model, code repository, proof script, table, checklist, or graph path is treated as the composite method itself.
3. **Order as mereology.** `SerialStepOf`, `ParallelFactorOf`, guarded choice, or fallback relation is placed in a structural part-whole chain.
4. **Typed joins disappear.** One submethod's intended result is assumed to satisfy the next submethod's precondition without an adapter method, governed correspondence or equivalence, and an explicit failure route.
5. **Interface exposure is hidden.** Callers rely on internal interactions that should be encapsulated, or fail to see interactions that the composite method must expose.
6. **Run-time leakage.** Resources, timestamps, telemetry, performed values, and results are baked into the method instead of remaining occurrence-side facts and separately governed resource, result, and evidence relations.
7. **False whole method.** A method-family registry, fallback table, selector rule, or A.22-selected relation organization is treated as one whole method although no construction or whole identity has been recovered.

### B.1.5:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Method reuse vs source concreteness | Teams need a reusable way of doing, while sources often show only one description, run, or plan. |
| Order fidelity vs compact modeling | Important sequences and joins must remain explicit without turning every diagram edge into ontology. |
| Whole-method identity vs relation usefulness | Some method-side relations are useful without asserting one composite method whole. |
| Interface exposure vs encapsulation | A composite method must state which interactions callers may rely on and which remain internal. |
| Assurance vs execution | Assurance needs joins, adapters, cutsets, and failure conditions; dated enactment, result, and evidence-use claims stay with their direct owners. |

### B.1.5:4 - Solution

A.3.1 first identifies the exact candidate `U.Method` and every exact part method. B.1.5 does not create their `U.Method` membership. It asks the narrower question: do these already identified methods, contributions, constraints, and boundary decisions warrant the claim that the candidate Method is composite?

Start with the smallest useful composition claim:

1. Name the same exact A.3.1 candidate Method and exact A.3.1 part methods.
2. In ordinary domain language, state the candidate's reusable whole action, what each part contributes, and the order, guard, adapter, or join condition that the whole action actually needs.
3. For every whole-forming statement other than B.1.5's narrow `methodPartOf`, use A.6.RCD's lightest sufficient disposition: an existing direct predicate, a local compound claim, or a reusable predicate-definition episteme. A convenient edge label is not a relation-kind admission.
4. Add stable relation-occurrence identity, typed declarations, publication, or assurance only when a named receiving use consumes that extra result. Route any relation-kind candidate through E.24 and E.24.UK rather than admitting it here.
5. If the whole action, boundary, contribution, or reidentification rule is still missing, stop the composite claim and keep the useful lower object under its direct owner.

**Minimal positive.** `BuildAndVerifyPumpUnit` is already an exact A.3.1 Method. Its construction rule requires frame assembly, motor installation, connector adaptation when the installed connector does not meet the test precondition, and functional testing; installation and any required adaptation must finish before testing, and adapter failure stops the whole before test. These plain claims, exact `methodPartOf` facts, and the whole identity rule can warrant the composite-method qualification without minting one relation kind per arrow.

**Discriminating non-composite.** `AssessVitals`, `ClassifyUrgency`, and `RouteToCare` can support readable result-to-precondition and guarded-dispatch claims while still lacking one reusable whole action, complete boundary, and whole reidentification rule. Keep those claims local and do not call their organization a composite Method. Select an A.22 `U.Structure` only if a real receiving use needs a load-bearing selected organization.

When a caller system, planner system, substituting-method selection use, auditor, or assurance use needs a reliance-bearing account, check the complete coordinates below. This is a reading checklist, not a schema, record, `RelationSignature`, or set of `SlotSpec`s.

```text
Composite-method qualification:
  candidate whole method: one exact U.Method already identified under A.3.1
  part methods: a non-empty set of exact U.Method values already identified under A.3.1
  B.1.5-owned method-part occurrences: methodPartOf(part method, whole method)
  other whole-forming claims and constraints:
    exact order, independence, guard, iteration, fallback, adapter, and join meanings used here
    each closed at A.6.RCD's lightest sufficient disposition
  whole semantics:
    generic participants, applicability, preconditions,
    intended effects or preserved conditions, invariants, bounds,
    accepted inputs and outputs, failure and stop conditions
  boundary decisions:
    exposed, forwarded, and encapsulated interactions
  identity and reidentification:
    what keeps this whole the same and what identifies another method
  enactment boundary:
    exact U.Work may enact the method only through A.15.1 enactsMethod
  lower disposition if construction is incomplete:
    selected U.Structure | U.MethodDescription | U.WorkPlan | U.Work |
    G.5 selector | lens | A.15.4 appearance-based reliance repair request
```

#### B.1.5:4.1 - Recover Parts Before Composition

Do not start from the word "step". Start from the object claim.

An apparent step can be:

- a `U.Method` submethod;
- a description constituent inside `U.MethodDescription`;
- a plan item inside `U.WorkPlan`;
- a dated `U.Work` occurrence or work part;
- an order, fallback, or selector claim among independently identified objects;
- a mathematical or representation lens over selected relations;
- mechanism or formal-substrate material;
- quoted wording that does not yet carry a method claim.

Only the first case can be a method part. Do not mint `U.StepSpec`, `U.StepMethod`, `U.MethodStep`, or `U.MethodAlgebra` for the others.

B.1.5 directly governs `MethodPartOfRelation`, expressed in Plain register as `methodPartOf(partMethod, wholeMethod)`. Both participants are exact `U.Method` values already identified under A.3.1. The predicate obtains exactly when the whole Method's stable construction rule names the part Method as a required contributor or as an admitted alternative for a required contribution, and that contribution participates in the whole's reusable action. It establishes neither A.14 structural-component parthood, a work part, nor a transformation part.

One `methodPartOf` occurrence is determined by the ordered pair `<part Method, whole Method>`. Every bounded alternative already admitted by the whole's construction rule can stand in `methodPartOf` at the same time; dated Work selecting one alternative does not start, end, or recur the other occurrences. For the same two exact Methods, the relation is atemporal: there is no silent cessation and later recurrence. If the construction rule changes so that a part is newly admitted or no longer admitted, the composite Method must be reidentified or the claim remains unresolved; reidentifying either participant gives another pair. This is why the participant pair is sufficient for the narrow B.1.5-owned family even when actual enactments vary.

A source label, list membership, diagram containment, shared name, registry entry, description membership, plan position, or work decomposition does not make `methodPartOf` obtain. When the test fails, keep the apparent step under its direct owner and do not add a negative part merely to complete a diagram.

#### B.1.5:4.2 - Test The Composite-Method Qualification

First identify the exact candidate Method under A.3.1 from its reusable action, participant meanings, applicability, preconditions, intended result or preserved condition, bounds, and failure or stop conditions. If that Method cannot yet be identified, return to A.3.1. B.1.5 then tests whether already identified part Methods and exact whole-forming facts justify calling that same candidate a composite Method; it does not create the candidate's Method identity.

State each whole-forming fact in ordinary domain language before choosing its representational or ontological disposition. The words *serial*, *parallel*, *guarded*, *iterative*, *fallback*, *adapter*, and *join* do not settle the claim by themselves.

| Composition cue | What the current claim must let a practitioner decide |
| --- | --- |
| serial | which earlier and later Methods participate in which whole, and which accepted result or preserved condition of the earlier Method must satisfy which precondition of the later Method before continuation |
| parallel | which branch Methods may proceed without a mutual order, the independence condition, and the exact join condition that must hold before the whole continues |
| guarded choice | which alternative Method is selected, the exact selection condition, what happens when no guard or several guards hold, and which whole contains that choice |
| iteration | which part Method repeats, what establishes another iteration, and the exact stop or failure condition |
| refinement or substitution | which Method may replace which other Method, for which use, and which whole semantics, joins, and exposed interactions must remain invariant |
| fallback or dispatch | which primary and alternative Methods are involved, the exact trigger for using the alternative, and whether the statement belongs to this whole or only to a selector registry |
| adapter or typed join | which exact adapter `U.Method`, upstream result meaning, downstream precondition, conversion condition, and failure route make the join admissible |

Then use A.6.RCD. Reuse an existing direct predicate when one already governs the needed claim. Otherwise stop at a local compound claim when it closes this use, or publish a reusable predicate-definition episteme when several uses need the same rule. Continue to a relation-kind candidate only when a named receiver needs stable occurrence semantics that claim content cannot supply; E.24 and E.24.UK decide admission. A label such as `precedesInMethod` is readable claim language, not admission evidence, and an ordinary composition claim needs no invented occurrence.

Keep definition, signature, kind, and edition distinct. A predicate-definition episteme may independently satisfy ordinary A.6.0 `U.Signature` membership. It is not a `RelationSignature`; that specialization opens only for an admitted relation kind. Changed predicate-definition or signature content identifies another episteme under C.2.1. Treat and connect the two epistemes as editions through `EpistemeEditionRelation` only when C.2.1's historical-continuation test passes: an exact system performed revision, refinement, or supersession Work under a Method whose semantics establish continuation, the earlier episteme participated through the exact source-to-revision use, and governed change facts support the claim. Otherwise the later episteme is a non-continuing replacement. The changed content triggers review of dependent claims; it does not by itself prove another relation kind or relation occurrence. If a relation kind is independently admitted, its direct subject owner supplies applicability, obtaining, continuation or cessation where relevant, and occurrence identity.

When several admitted order occurrences must be reviewed together, use B.1.4's `OrderSpec`, exact ordered-relation designations, and join or independence conditions in a separate bounded-use aggregation record. The record and optional `Gamma_ctx` notation neither participate in Method identity nor make any relation obtain. When the order statements remain local claims rather than admitted relation occurrences, compare those claim contents directly and do not pretend that an `OrderSpec` has occurrences to aggregate.

The composite-method qualification holds only when the candidate Method also has its own reusable semantic action, generic participant meanings, applicability, preconditions, intended effects or preserved conditions, invariants, bounds, accepted inputs and outputs, failure and stop conditions, and interface decisions. Its identity includes the exact part Methods and construction architecture on which those semantics depend. Cite an effective reference scheme or claim scope only when its variation changes a Method meaning or the use of a claim about that Method; neither is a generic container.

State the reidentification rule with the qualification. The same exact candidate continues through only those parameter changes, reorderings, or part substitutions that its A.3.1 identity rule already permits while preserving the whole action, applicability, preconditions, intended result or preserved condition, bounds, required joins, and interface boundary. A change outside those permitted variations identifies another `U.Method`. Use B.2 when a separate higher-level reidentification or emergence claim is current; a B.2 label is not needed to state an ordinary B.1.5 rule.

#### B.1.5:4.3 - Keep Order Out Of Structural Mereology

Source cues such as `SerialStepOf`, `ParallelFactorOf`, guarded choice, iteration, fallback, adapter, and typed join call attention to possible whole-forming claims. They are not admission evidence, they need not become relation kinds, they are not A.14 component parthood, and they do not make `methodPartOf` obtain by themselves.

Use A.14, C.13, and B.3.5 when the claim is about structural parts of a holon. Use B.1.5 when the claim is about how reusable ways of doing construct a larger reusable way of doing. The same project may need both, but the relation occurrences and truth conditions remain separate.

Use B.1.4 when a receiving use needs an inspectable order aggregation, partial-order test, or join/independence account. Its `OrderSpec` and optional notation describe already recovered order occurrences; B.1.5 still decides whether those methods and relations construct one composite `U.Method`.

When the current claim is a proper temporal restriction of one unchanged non-Work carrier, apply that subject's direct identity rule and A.14/B.1.4 rather than B.1.5. For MethodDescription history, compare the C.2.1 identity triples and assert `EpistemeEditionRelation` only when its historical-continuation predicate obtains. For Work intervals, episodes, performed parts, retries, resumptions, or later occurrences, apply A.15.1's exact relations; generic `PhaseOf` is not their substitute. A temporal boundary becomes a B.2-family question only when a separate whole-reidentification, closure, or supervision claim remains. Order, temporal restriction, episteme edition, Work segmentation, structural parthood, method composition, and whole reidentification remain different claims even when one source diagram uses one line for all of them.

#### B.1.5:4.4 - Expose The Composite Method Interface

The candidate Method's reusable action includes a boundary decision for each interaction:

- **exposed:** a caller system may rely on the interaction as part of the whole Method;
- **forwarded:** a caller system may address an internal submethod interaction through a declared designation or adapter;
- **encapsulated:** the interaction is internal and cannot be relied on from outside the whole Method.

An exposure decision contributes to Method identity whenever changing it changes the reusable action or its admissible boundary. That identity consequence does not wait for an outside party to rely on the Method. A named caller, planner, auditor, substituting-method selection use, or assurance use instead determines when the decision must be stated explicitly or published for reuse. Name the interaction, precondition, result or preserved condition, failure route, and any adapter needed for each exposed or forwarded case.

#### B.1.5:4.4.1 - Composite-Method Boundary Account and Publication Form

When a named receiver must reuse the boundary account, first identify one exact claim-bearing `U.MethodDescription` episteme under A.3.2 and C.2.1. Its claim content concerns the exact composite Method and states the exposed, forwarded, and encapsulated interactions. Then keep the publication-side objects and designation content below separate.

In B.1.5, *composite-Method boundary account* is the local Plain phrase for this MethodDescription claim content. A *boundary-account form* is the separately identified reusable arrangement used to present that content when publication is load-bearing. Neither phrase creates a new kind or acronym. The separate A.10 instantiation card keeps its different design-time use for Precedes, Choice, Join, guards, and exceptions.

1. A bounded-use-declaration episteme states the operations or decisions supported by this publication, the conditions of that use, and the excluded stronger use.
2. An audience-declaration episteme states the audience criterion. The actual audience consists of entities admitted by that declaration; those entities are not substituted for the declaration episteme as a publication-relation participant.
3. An independently identified reusable boundary-account arrangement is a publication-form participant only while E.24.PUB `PublicationFormExpressionRelation(description edition, boundary-account form, bounded-use declaration)` obtains.
4. A paper card, poster, page, file, or screen must first be identified independently as a physical or digital `U.PresentationCarrier`; E.24.PUB `PublicationFormBearingRelation(carrier, boundary-account form)` then states which form it bears.
5. An actual system performs separate rendering, printing, uploading, indexing, or access-granting publication Work. That Work may establish or restore availability, but it is not the publication occurrence or one of its participants.
6. One `EpistemePublicationRelation` occurrence, with the exact five participants `<description edition, audience-declaration episteme, bounded-use-declaration episteme, boundary-account form, carrier>`, makes the edition available to the declared audience for the declared use throughout its maximal continuous interval of availability. The relation occurrence is not performed by the publishing system, and the boundary-account form does not publish itself.
7. Names, labels, and links that designate the Method or description edition remain separately governed designation content. Neither the form nor the carrier establishes designation merely by displaying similar words.

```text
Reader-facing boundary-account prompts:
  described Method, exact MethodDescription edition, and effective reference scheme when its variation changes the Method meaning or claim use
  named audience criterion and bounded use, including any excluded stronger use, when publication is load-bearing
  exposed and forwarded interactions
  accepted input or call meaning
  preconditions and intended result or preserved condition
  failure and stop routes
  invariants
  exact B.1.4 order aggregation or OrderSpec only when the receiver relies on its order, join, or independence limits
  applicability, bounds, and quality or assurance envelope only when they limit the interaction on which the receiver relies
  adapter, typed-join, and assurance references only when the receiver uses them
  plain rationale for each encapsulated interaction on which misuse is likely
```

These prompts organize presentation; they are not direct-relation `SlotSpec`s, relation participants, Method parts, or a schema that creates a Method. None supplies the world-side `methodPartOf` facts or any other whole-forming claim. For a lightweight internal use, state the few boundary decisions in clear sentences and stop; do not create a description edition, declaration episteme, boundary-account form, carrier, publication Work, or publication occurrence by ritual.

#### B.1.5:4.5 - Keep Method Qualification And Work Occurrence Separate

B.1.5 evaluates and grounds the composite-method qualification of an exact `U.Method` already identified under A.3.1. A separately constituted `U.MethodDescription` may state that composition claim. Neither object creates performed Work.

One dated occurrence `W : U.Work` enacts the exact method `M : U.Method` only when A.15.1 `enactsMethod(W, M)` obtains. For every actual performer system `S`, recover the exact assignment `RA : U.RoleAssignment` whose holder is `S` and the F.6 attribution `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` when explicit attribution identity is used; `S` performs the Work and `RA` does not act. The temporal extent and `executedWithin` relation remain occurrence-side facts. An assertion or occurrence-description episteme may cite those facts and the method-description reference used; the Work occurrence does not store a card or record.

Parameter bindings, affected referents, resource use, telemetry, retries, results, actual transformations, production, evidence, evaluation, delivery, and acceptance remain separate objects and direct relations under their own governors. They do not become method parts, method identity fields, or generic Work outcomes merely because a report places them beside the Work.

The composition link is not one-to-one. A Work occurrence may enact the whole method without exposing every submethod as a separate work part. An exact A.15.1 `TemporalPartOf_work` may enact the same whole method during its selected interval. An A.15.1 episode may span several method factors, repeat one factor, or be split by evidence policy without changing the method identity. Conversely, a work part does not establish a submethod. A work part enacts a submethod only when that submethod is already an independently identified `U.Method` and a separate `enactsMethod(workPart, submethod)` occurrence obtains.

**Reader check.** Before saying that a work part enacts a submethod, name both sides:

- the occurrence-side object: parent `U.Work`, obtaining work-part relation, interval or boundary, performer system, covering assignment, and any separately obtaining resource or evidence relation;
- the method-side object: exact A.3.1 submethod, `methodPartOf` occurrence, whole-forming claim at its A.6.RCD disposition, preconditions, intended result or preserved condition, interface boundary, and whole-Method identity;
- the cross-side fact: the exact `enactsMethod(workPart, submethod)` occurrence.

If any side is missing, lower only that side. Do not repair a missing submethod by inventing a work part, and do not repair a missing work part by inventing a submethod. Keep a method-description node, evidence segment, mechanism material, system-component behavior, or `A.15.4` appearance-based reliance repair request under its direct owner.

#### B.1.5:4.5.1 - Planning And Performed-Work Obligations

B.1.5 has three common use positions, but they are positions in use, not U-kinds:

- **Planning or description-side use.** A planner system performing planning Work recovers the exact Methods, `methodPartOf` occurrences, whole-forming claims at their A.6.RCD dispositions, any justified order aggregation, typed joins or adapters, interface boundary, invariants, and whole-level commitments. A resulting exact `U.WorkPlan` may cite the MethodDescription edition on which it relies; neither the planning Work nor the plan is the reader that defines Method identity.
- **Performed-work use.** Recover the exact `enactsMethod` occurrence for the whole Work. Check the performer system and covering assignment, plus capability fit or admission only when the work-entry decision consumes those claims; then check preconditions, order conformance, and exposed or forwarded interactions through their direct owners. State resource use, evidence, and results only through their own obtaining relations. None becomes part of the method.
- **Assurance use.** Identify cutset submethods, fragile typed joins, adapter points, mapping congruence or CL-sensitive edges, and the envelope or scope in which the composite method is expected to hold. B.3 and related assurance patterns evaluate those hooks; B.1.5 only makes them visible.

Useful invariants remain: a single recovered submethod composed alone does not create a surprising new Method; order is deterministic only under the exact order claims and conditions at their selected A.6.RCD dispositions; any throughput or quality bound must name its characteristic, critical path, and weakest-link basis; strengthening a submethod, adapter, or typed join should not make the composite Method worse unless a stated side condition changes.

#### B.1.5:4.5.2 - Stop Before Transformation Composition

Method composition and Work decomposition establish no `U.Transformation` part, composite transformation, transformation atomism, or `TransformationPartOfRelation`. Even when several method parts address the same referent and one Work enacts the whole method, identify each actual transformation independently under A.3.4. If a claim needs transformation composition and no direct transformation-composition governor supplies its participants, obtaining rule, and occurrence identity, return `missing-governor[transformation-composition]` for the proposed whole and independently identified changes. Do not infer either composition or indivisibility from the gap.

#### B.1.5:4.6 - Select A Structure Below The Whole-Method Threshold

Use A.22 when independently identified Methods and already obtaining relations are useful to one question or action but do not construct one whole Method. For an actual load-bearing selection, first name the selecting system, selection Method, dated selection Work and bindings, and any result episteme needed to preserve the decision. Then name all four structure discriminators: exact constituents, exact selected obtaining relation occurrences, applied constraints, and the use frame. For a one-off hypothetical comparison, state the comparison and stop without asserting a selected `U.Structure`. `MethodRelationStructure` may be used as a local readable designator only for an actually selected structure; it is not a U-kind, relation kind, Method holon, or identity field.

Typical cases:

- a fallback registry selects among alternatives but supplies no whole method;
- a workflow diagram relates method descriptions but does not recover method parts;
- a method family has independently governed refinement, substitution, or dispatch relations;
- a graph or algebra represents selected method relations as a lens;
- the same method labels occur under different effective reference schemes, while the local senses have not been resolved and any F.9 Bridge would establish only sense correspondence, not method identity;
- a work plan orders tasks but does not define one reusable method.

The selected structure is a dependent organization for its named use. It does not create its constituents or relations, become a Method, or supply holonhood. Conversely, the internal construction of one exact Method whose composite qualification has been established does not become a second generic structure merely because a diagram can display it. Select a `U.Structure` only when that organization itself changes the next question or action.

This lower object is not a failure. It is the right governed object when relation organization is useful but whole-method construction is not current.

### B.1.5:5 - Archetypal Grounding — Worked Slices

#### B.1.5:5.1 - Manufacturing Recipe

`AssembleFrame`, `InstallMotor`, `AdaptMotorConnector`, `RunFunctionalTest`, and `BuildAndVerifyPumpUnit` are exact `U.Method` values already identified under A.3.1; the last is now the candidate for a composite-method qualification. The four participant-determined occurrences `methodPartOf(AssembleFrame, BuildAndVerifyPumpUnit)`, `methodPartOf(InstallMotor, BuildAndVerifyPumpUnit)`, `methodPartOf(AdaptMotorConnector, BuildAndVerifyPumpUnit)`, and `methodPartOf(RunFunctionalTest, BuildAndVerifyPumpUnit)` obtain because the stable whole construction rule names each contribution. Every already admitted connector-adapter alternative may stand in `methodPartOf` simultaneously; one Work occurrence selecting an alternative does not toggle those atemporal occurrences. Removing a contribution from the construction rule, adding a new admitted alternative, or changing a required order, join, whole result, or boundary outside the declared variations identifies another whole Method.

For the ordinary use, say: the installed motor must provide the harness-installed condition required by functional test; when the supplier connector does not provide it, `AdaptMotorConnector` must provide the conversion before test; adapter failure stops the whole before test. In this one use, `PumpInstallBeforeTest` and `PumpConnectorAdapterJoin` are readable labels for local compound claim content in the exact `PumpBuildCompositionDescription-v1 : U.MethodDescription` episteme under A.3.2 and C.2.1, not relation-kind names or occurrence designators. If several pump-family uses need the same parameterized rule, A.6.RCD can identify a reusable predicate-definition episteme. Only a later named receiver that needs stable occurrences can justify returning a derived-kind candidate to E.24 and E.24.UK.

The composite qualification additionally requires the candidate's generic participants, applicability, preconditions, accepted inputs, final effect, preserved conditions, exposed start and abort interactions, encapsulated calibration interaction, failure routes, and reidentification rule. A list of the five names or an arrow diagram establishes none of these facts.

`PumpUnitBuildWork-2026-07-29` may enact the whole through one exact `enactsMethod` occurrence without four corresponding work parts. If a separately admitted `MotorInstallationWorkPart-2026-07-29` exists, it enacts `InstallMotor` only through its own `enactsMethod` occurrence. Resource use, test telemetry, the produced pump unit, acceptance, and evidence remain under their direct owners.

#### B.1.5:5.2 - Emergency Intake

`RegisterPatient`, `AssessVitals`, `ClassifyUrgency`, and `RouteToCare` are independently identified Methods. For a one-off protocol review, the practitioner may state two local claims in ordinary language: the intended vital-sign result meaning of `AssessVitals` must satisfy the admitted input meaning of `ClassifyUrgency`; and the declared triage rule decides which admitted urgency category holds from the declared vital-sign conditions and, when the protocol uses them, the declared symptom conditions, then maps that category to one compatible `RouteToCare`. If no category or several incompatible categories hold, the practitioner stops the routing decision and returns the guard rule for repair. These are useful claim contents, not `MethodResultPreconditionRelation` or `MethodDispatchRelation` admissions.

This review is deliberately hypothetical and non-load-bearing. It compares the four Methods and the two claims but does not assert a persisted `U.Structure` or a selection judgment. If a later receiving use needs an A.22-selected structure, its selection must identify the exact selecting system, selection Method, dated selection Work and bindings, and—where the result must persist—the result episteme. The structure itself is then identified by all four A.22 discriminators: exact constituents, exact independently admitted obtaining relation occurrences, applied constraints, and use frame. The present local claims cannot be relabelled as such occurrences merely to fill that list.

The comparison still discriminates the non-composite case. No reusable whole action, complete precondition-to-result boundary, response to every guard conflict, or whole reidentification rule has been established. A wall poster may be a carrier bearing a publication form; an exact `U.MethodDescription` edition is a different claim-bearing episteme, and an actual publication occurrence is what makes that edition available to an audience. A system performing intake Work is separately checked for its role assignment and any capability or admission claim consumed by the work-entry decision. None of these facts is a Method part.

If a later hospital protocol first identifies an exact A.3.1 Method such as `EmergencyIntakeMethod-v4` with the missing whole semantics, B.1.5 can test its composite-method qualification. Neither a poster, the one-off comparison, nor a later selected structure turns into that Method.

#### B.1.5:5.3 - Learned Model Pipeline

A neural-network pipeline may describe feature extraction, embedding, attention, retrieval, ranking, and explanation generation. Some blocks may be formal substrate or mechanism material, some may be constituents of a `U.MethodDescription`, and some may be recovered as `U.Method` values.

After the candidate whole represented by the pipeline and every claimed part have been independently identified as exact A.3.1 Methods, that candidate qualifies as composite only when exact `methodPartOf` occurrences, whole-forming claims at their A.6.RCD dispositions, accepted inputs and outputs, invariants or admissibility conditions, typed joins, fallback behavior, failure conditions, interface decisions, and reidentification rule are present. Otherwise keep the graph as a MethodDescription, mathematical lens, mechanism material, or—when an actual selection basis and receiving use exist—an A.22-selected `U.Structure`.

Suppose one dated training Work enacts the exact pipeline Method while three independently identified transformations occur: the feature store changes, model parameters change, and the ranking index changes. Common Work, shared data, Method order, and temporal adjacency do not establish transformation parts or one composite transformation. Without a direct transformation-composition governor, retain the three transformations and return `missing-governor[transformation-composition]` for the proposed three-change whole; do not call them atomic either.

#### B.1.5:5.4 - Evidence Synthesis And Publication

`CollectDatasets`, `NormalizeSchemas`, `EstimateModel`, `CrossValidate`, `DraftManuscript`, and `EvidenceSynthesisAndPublication-v3` must first be exact A.3.1 Methods. B.1.5 can qualify the last as composite only when every claimed `methodPartOf` occurrence obtains and its whole-forming claims and constraints pass A.6.RCD's lightest sufficient disposition. In ordinary language, the intended result of `NormalizeSchemas` must satisfy the admitted input meaning of `EstimateModel`; legacy datasets may require adapter Methods; `CrossValidate` may be a critical cutset for later assurance; and a provenance condition may be a precondition of `DraftManuscript` before publication Work begins.

A paper draft, workflow diagram, repository, or notebook may be a claim-bearing episteme, a representation, or a carrier; its form does not make it the Method. Publication Work is `U.Work`. Compute, storage, reviewer time, artifact production, release, and acceptance stay with their direct owners.

`EvidenceSynthesisInterfaceDescription-v3 : U.MethodDescription` may state that the Method exposes `Submit()` and `ReleaseArtifacts()`, forwards `CrossValidate.Folds(k)`, and encapsulates ad hoc scrubbing utilities. Identify `SubmissionReleaseBoundaryAccountForm-v3` independently as the reusable arrangement entity selected as the boundary-account form. Identify `EvidenceSynthesisMethodsPage-2026-07 : U.PresentationCarrier` independently as the digital carrier. Identify `SubmissionAndArtifactReleaseUse : U.Episteme` as the bounded-use declaration whose claims state the supported submission and artifact-release operations, their conditions, and the excluded stronger use. Identify `SubmittingResearchersAudienceDeclaration-v1 : U.Episteme` as the audience declaration whose claims select the authorized submitting researchers; those researchers are the declared audience, not a participant substituted for the declaration episteme.

`PublicationFormExpressionRelation(EvidenceSynthesisInterfaceDescription-v3, SubmissionReleaseBoundaryAccountForm-v3, SubmissionAndArtifactReleaseUse)` must obtain for that form use, and `PublicationFormBearingRelation(EvidenceSynthesisMethodsPage-2026-07, SubmissionReleaseBoundaryAccountForm-v3)` must obtain for that bearing claim. `ResearchPublicationSystem` performs the separate `EvidenceSynthesisInterfacePublicationWork-2026-07 : U.Work`, which may establish or restore availability. The distinct `EvidenceSynthesisInterfacePublication-2026-07` occurrence of `EpistemePublicationRelation` has the five fixed participants `<EvidenceSynthesisInterfaceDescription-v3, SubmittingResearchersAudienceDeclaration-v1, SubmissionAndArtifactReleaseUse, SubmissionReleaseBoundaryAccountForm-v3, EvidenceSynthesisMethodsPage-2026-07>` and carries the description edition's enduring availability to the audience selected by the audience declaration for the bounded use. Publication Work is not a participant of that occurrence. None of these description, declaration, form, carrier, Work, or publication-relation objects creates an interaction, `SlotSpec`, Method part, or composition fact.

### B.1.5:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: cross-domain order-sensitive composition of already identified `U.Method` values. It does not cover sole-Method identification, description-only organization, dated Work decomposition, structural mereology, or transformation composition without a direct governor.

- **Gov:** each `methodPartOf` occurrence and each other whole-forming claim stays with its direct governor; a named receiver changes how much of the boundary account must be stated or published, not whether a world-side fact obtains.
- **Arch:** the whole is qualified from exact part Methods and construction facts; order aggregation, a selected A.22 Structure, and a separate higher-level reidentification claim remain distinct architectural objects.
- **Onto/Epist:** Methods and obtaining relation occurrences remain distinct from MethodDescription claims, boundary-account presentation, carriers, publication Work, and publication occurrences.
- **Prag:** ordinary use may stop at readable local claims; reusable definitions, relation kinds, declarations, publication, and assurance are added only when a named receiving use needs them.
- **Did:** the manufacturing, emergency-intake, learned-pipeline, and evidence-synthesis slices show both positive composition and useful non-composite stopping results across different domains.

The pattern intentionally biases toward explicit construction and boundary accounts when joins or outside reliance are load-bearing. The lightweight local-claim lane and direct-owner exits mitigate that bias so inspectability does not become ritual apparatus.

### B.1.5:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-B1.5-1` | The candidate whole and every claimed Method part are independently identified as exact `U.Method` values under A.3.1 before B.1.5 tests the composite-method qualification. |
| `CC-B1.5-2` | Step wording, description nodes, plan items, Work occurrences, file modules, graph edges, registries, source wording, mechanism material, formal substrates, mathematical lenses, and evidence or publication-use claims are not Method parts by position or label. Keep each with its direct governor unless it is independently identified as an exact `U.Method` and `methodPartOf` separately obtains. |
| `CC-B1.5-3` | Every `methodPartOf(partMethod, wholeMethod)` occurrence passes the required-contribution or admitted-alternative test. Its ordered-pair identity is exact; all bounded alternatives may obtain simultaneously, Work selection does not toggle them, and a changed admitted-part set reidentifies the whole Method or leaves the claim open. |
| `CC-B1.5-4` | Every serial, parallel, guarded, iterative, fallback, adapter, substitution, or typed-join use states a concrete decidable claim and selects A.6.RCD's lightest sufficient disposition. A relation kind and occurrence are required only after independent admission for a named occurrence-semantics use. |
| `CC-B1.5-5` | The already identified candidate Method states whole-level participant meanings, applicability, preconditions, intended effects or preserved conditions, invariants, bounds, accepted inputs and outputs, failure and stop conditions, interface decisions, and reidentification rule before its composite qualification is accepted. |
| `CC-B1.5-6` | Exposed, forwarded, and encapsulated interactions are distinguished because changing the reusable action or admissible boundary changes Method identity. A named caller system, planner system, auditor, substituting-method selection use, or assurance use determines whether the boundary account must be explicit or published; reliance does not create its identity effect. |
| `CC-B1.5-7` | Exact `U.MethodDescription` edition, independently identified boundary-account form and `U.PresentationCarrier`, bounded-use- and audience-declaration epistemes, separate publication Work, five-participant `EpistemePublicationRelation` occurrence, raw audience, and designation content remain distinct. `PublicationFormExpressionRelation` and `PublicationFormBearingRelation` state the supporting links; a system performs the Work, while the publication occurrence makes the edition available. |
| `CC-B1.5-8` | A load-bearing A.22 selection names the selecting system, selection Method, dated Work and bindings, any persisted result episteme, and the structure's exact constituents, independently admitted obtaining relation occurrences, constraints, and use frame. A one-off hypothetical comparison asserts no selected `U.Structure`. |
| `CC-B1.5-9` | When the composite method needs a separate higher-level reidentification or emergence explanation, use `B.2` in addition to the explicit B.1.5 method reidentification rule. |
| `CC-B1.5-10` | A temporal slice, episode, event-log segment, telemetry interval, engine stroke, detector component, or `U.WorkPlan` item is neither a Work part nor a Method part by appearance. Keep each with its direct owner. A genuine Work part enacts a submethod only through a separate exact A.15.1 `enactsMethod` occurrence; whole Work may enact the whole Method without mirrored Work parts. |
| `CC-B1.5-11` | A receiving use that needs order aggregation names B.1.4's exact ordered relation designations, `OrderSpec`, and join or independence conditions; the aggregation record or notation does not enter method identity or make relations obtain. |
| `CC-B1.5-12` | Typed joins name the upstream intended-result meaning and downstream precondition, plus an adapter or governed correspondence when those meanings differ, and a failure route; signatures do not become `U.Capability` instances. |
| `CC-B1.5-13` | Dated Work, performer systems, role assignments, resource use and costs, yields, dissipation, telemetry, results, and production, together with separate evidence-, publication-use-, evaluation-, delivery-, and acceptance claims, use their direct owners and do not become Method identity fields. |
| `CC-B1.5-14` | Assurance hooks name cutsets, fragile joins, adapter points, CL-sensitive mappings, and the exact envelope or claim scope consumed by B.3; no performance or quality claim follows from composition alone. |
| `CC-B1.5-15` | A direct method-composition claim establishes no A.14 structural-component relation, work-part relation, or selected-structure identity unless the corresponding direct predicate separately obtains. |
| `CC-B1.5-16` | Method parts, Work parts, common referents, method order, and temporal adjacency establish neither transformation parthood nor a composite transformation; missing transformation-composition governance returns `missing-governor[transformation-composition]` for the proposed whole and independently identified changes, without an atomism inference. |

### B.1.5:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Repair |
| --- | --- |
| "The workflow diagram is the composite Method." | First govern the diagram as `U.MethodDescription` or another representation; identify the exact candidate and part Methods under A.3.1, then test `methodPartOf`, whole-forming claims at their A.6.RCD dispositions, whole semantics, boundary, and reidentification. |
| "Step A is part of the Method because it is a box." | Recover whether the box denotes an exact `U.Method`, description node, plan item, Work occurrence, claim, or lens expression; test `methodPartOf` only for an independently identified Method. |
| "Parallel branches can join because the picture rejoins." | State the independence, downstream precondition, exact join, any adapter or correspondence, and failure route in ordinary language; use A.6.RCD's lightest sufficient disposition and open a relation kind only for an independently accepted occurrence-semantics need. |
| "The selector table is the Method." | Use `G.5` for the selector. Use A.22 only when an actual selection basis and all four structure discriminators are present; otherwise keep a one-off comparison without asserting a selected `U.Structure`. A composite Method still needs its own exact construction and whole-level commitments. |
| "The run proved the method structure." | Record the run as `U.Work`; relate it to the method through `enactsMethod` and use evidence only through its governing relation. A successful run neither creates method parts nor settles reidentification. |
| "The phase is a method step." | Recover the subject: use the carrier's direct identity rule plus proper A.14 `PhaseOf` for one unchanged non-Work individual, C.2.1 for distinct MethodDescription epistemes and any obtaining edition relation, or A.15.1 for Work temporal parts and occurrences. None is a Method part unless an exact `U.Method` and `methodPartOf` independently obtain; use B.2 only for a separately current whole-reidentification, supervision, or closure claim. |
| "The join improves throughput, so the method has emergence." | Name the measured characteristic, critical path, cutsets, typed joins, and assurance relation; open B.2 only when a separate whole-level reidentification claim remains. |
| "The boundary-account prompts define the Method." | Identify the exact claim-bearing `U.MethodDescription` edition first. A boundary-account form is a reusable form only when `PublicationFormExpressionRelation` obtains; its prompts create neither the Method nor the form, carrier, declaration epistemes, publication Work, five-participant publication occurrence, or composition facts. |
| "The boundary account is a nice diagram." | For a load-bearing publication, identify the MethodDescription edition, bounded-use- and audience-declaration epistemes, boundary-account form, and carrier independently; then distinguish the system's publication Work from the five-participant occurrence that makes the edition available. Keep designation content separate. Otherwise state the few boundary decisions directly. |
| "The same Work and referent make the transformations one composite." | Identify each transformation under A.3.4. Without a direct transformation-composition governor, return `missing-governor[transformation-composition]` for the proposed whole and independently identified changes; infer neither composition nor atomism. |

### B.1.5:9 - Consequences

B.1.5 buys inspectable Method composition without confusing the candidate Method, composition claim, MethodDescription, selected Structure, Work occurrence, resource use, and assurance argument. The practitioner can say which exact Methods are parts, which ordinary whole-forming claims and constraints qualify the candidate as composite, which interactions belong to its boundary, what exact Work enacts it, and where a stronger claim must stop.

The cost is proportionate explicitness: exact Methods, `methodPartOf` occurrences, whole-forming claim content, order and join conditions, interface decisions, whole semantics, and reidentification must be stated before the composite qualification can be relied on. Ordinary use can stop at readable local claims; reusable definitions, relation kinds, declarations, publication, and assurance are added only when a named receiver needs them.

### B.1.5:10 - Rationale

The rationale is a strict object separation. Paying this explicitness cost exposes brittle joins and accidental external dependencies at Method boundaries before someone relies on the composite claim. Order is semantic but not structural parthood. A method can be a non-agentive holon, but a step label, graph node, phase, source section, description constituent, plan item, or work part is not a method part until the `U.Method` and `methodPartOf` occurrence are recovered. `Gamma_method` concerns ways of doing; `Gamma_work` supports occurrence-side resource analysis; B.3 evaluates assurance; A.22 selects useful relation organizations; B.2 handles a separately current higher-level reidentification claim. None of those neighboring objects replaces the direct B.1.5 construction facts.

### B.1.5:11 - SoTA-Echoing

These rows answer the B.1.5 practice question: how to decide and expose order-sensitive Method composition without mistaking descriptions, Work, event records, or construction diagrams for the composite Method.

| Current practice answer | Published source basis | B.1.5 adoption | Rejected shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current workflow, case, decision, process-mining, and object-centric event-log practice separates process models from event logs, telemetry, and resource records. | `A.15:11` — OMG CMMN 1.1 (2016) and OMG DMN 1.5 (2024); `A.15.1:13.1` — OCEL 2.0 Specification (2024) and OpenTelemetry Specification 1.58.0. | **Adopt and adapt.** Adopt the model, decision, occurrence, log, and telemetry separations; adapt them by requiring exact candidate and part Methods, `methodPartOf`, and separately grounded Work because a review must distinguish modeled composition from what happened. | **Reject.** A workflow notation, event log, trace, or telemetry span is neither the composite Method nor proof of Method parts or dated Work. |
| Typed functional, scoped-effect, protocol, and workflow-composition practice treats composition as constrained by interfaces, preconditions, intended results, handlers, scope, and admissible order. | `A.3.1:11` — Gogioso et al., “Constructor Theory as Process Theory” (2023); Bosman et al., “A Calculus for Scoped Effects & Handlers” (2024); Matache et al., “Scoped Effects as Parameterized Algebraic Theories” (2024). | **Adapt.** Use preconditions, intended-result meanings, scope, order, typed joins, adapters, and failure routes as concrete tests of the whole-forming claim because a composition label alone cannot show that one reusable whole action works. Use A.6.RCD's lightest sufficient disposition for each resulting claim. | **Reject.** A type signature, handler calculus, process-theory description, edge label, or source-material description alone does not identify a Method part, admit a relation kind, or ground dated Work. |
| Systems and software architecture practice uses explicit interfaces, exposure, encapsulation, and traceability to make composed behavior reviewable and substitutable. | `A.15:11` — ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 and OMG SysML v2.0 Language Specification (2025); `A.3.1:11` — the current scoped-effect sources cited above. | **Adopt and adapt.** Adopt explicit exposure and encapsulation; adapt them so a boundary decision affects Method identity when it changes the reusable action or admissible boundary, while a named receiver triggers explicit statement or publication because callers and substituting-method uses need a stable boundary account. | **Reject.** Planner Work, publication layout, carrier choice, or diagram position does not decide whether an interaction is exposed, forwarded, or encapsulated. |
| Current constructional-ontology practice requires explicit constituents, constructive relations, dependence, and identity choices rather than inferring a whole from a diagram or label. | `A.1:11` — Florio and Linnebo, *Introduction to Constructional Ontology* (2024), and Borgo and Righetti, “Towards Applied Constructional Ontology” (2025). | **Adapt.** Require exact part Methods, obtaining `methodPartOf` occurrences, other whole-forming claims at their A.6.RCD dispositions, a reusable whole action, and a reidentification rule because constituent names alone do not construct a Method whole. | **Reject.** Method-composition order is not A.14 structural parthood, and neither a C.13 notation nor one shared label creates the Method or a relation kind. |

**Currentness and reopen.** These four decisions are qualified by the exact source selections cited above. Reopen only the affected row when a cited source or edition is superseded, or when newer practice changes the relied-on model/occurrence separation, order or join condition, interface or substitution boundary, or construction and reidentification test. Recheck that row's B.1.5 adoption, refusal, and affected Solution, worked-case, checklist, and Relations loci; leave unaffected rows closed.

### B.1.5:12 - Relations

- Uses `A.1` for the general non-agentive-holon recognition boundary; A.1 does not supply Method-part or whole-forming facts.
- Uses `A.3.1` to identify the exact candidate Method and every exact part Method before B.1.5 tests the composite-method qualification; B.1.5 directly governs only `MethodPartOfRelation` and the composite-construction test.
- Uses `A.6.RCD` for serial, parallel, guarded, iterative, fallback, adapter, join, substitution, and other whole-forming claims. Existing direct predicates, local compound claims, and reusable predicate definitions are valid stopping results; only a named occurrence-semantics need returns a kind candidate to `E.24` and `E.24.UK`.
- Uses `A.6.REL` only when an independently admitted relation kind has an obtaining occurrence whose identity a receiver consumes. B.1.5 does not manufacture occurrence semantics for ordinary claim content.
- Uses `C.2.1` to identify predicate-definition, signature, and MethodDescription epistemes and any later episteme with changed identity-bearing content. Uses `EpistemeEditionRelation` only when C.2.1's exact historical-continuation predicate obtains; otherwise the later episteme is a non-continuing replacement. A predicate definition may satisfy ordinary A.6.0 `U.Signature` membership; only an admitted relation kind can have a `RelationSignature`.
- Uses `B.1.4` only when a receiving use needs an explicit aggregation of already admitted, obtaining order relations, an `OrderSpec`, and join or independence conditions.
- Uses `A.3.2` for each exact claim-bearing `U.MethodDescription` and `E.24.PUB` only when a named use requires publication detail: independently identified bounded-use- and audience-declaration epistemes, boundary-account form and `U.PresentationCarrier`; exact `PublicationFormExpressionRelation` and `PublicationFormBearingRelation`; separate publication Work performed by a system; and the five-participant `EpistemePublicationRelation` occurrence that makes the edition available. Raw audience and designation content remain separately governed.
- Uses `A.15`, `A.15.1`, and `A.15.2` for role/method alignment, exact dated `U.Work`, `enactsMethod`, and plans; the Method does not act, Work is not a relying reader, and a role assignment does not perform Work.
- Uses `B.1.6` and `Gamma_work` only for occurrence-side work-resource aggregation after the Work and resource relations are recovered.
- Uses `B.3` for cutset, weakest-link, CL-sensitive mapping, and assurance claims; composition alone supplies no assurance verdict.
- Uses `A.22` only for a real selected organization with its selection basis and four identity discriminators. A one-off hypothetical comparison and local whole-forming claims do not assert a selected `U.Structure`.
- Uses `C.13` only after B.1.5 supplies exact Method parts, whole-forming facts and constraints, and the whole reidentification rule; C.13 consumes those facts but does not create them or require one relation kind per fact.
- Keeps A.14 structural-component parthood distinct from Method composition; coordinates with `B.3.5` only when a published structural claim and its grounding are current.
- Uses `B.2` when a separate higher-level reidentification or emergence-family explanation is current; ordinary composite-Method identity still needs its explicit B.1.5 rule.
- Uses `G.5` when a Method-family registry, selector, fallback, or candidate-set decision is current but no whole construction is claimed.
- Uses `C.29`, `A.6.1`, and `E.20` when a mathematical lens, formal substrate, mechanism, or representation-maintenance claim is current.
- Uses `E.10` for method, step, process, workflow, ownership/stewardship, requirement, and source wording precision recovery.
- Stops before any positive transformation-composition or transformation-part claim until a direct governor supplies exact participants, obtaining semantics, and occurrence identity.

### B.1.5:End
