## B.3 - Trust and Assurance Calculus (F-G-R with Congruence)

> **Type:** Foundational (B)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative for FPF use that claims assurance, trust, readiness, compliance, safety, release confidence, `F`, `G`, `R`, or `CL` for a named claim.

> **Plain-English headline.**
> B.3 defines how assurance or trust is assigned, aggregated, and reused for physical systems, epistemes, and publication or evidence records that are used to claim assurance. It uses one typed assurance tuple, F-G-R: `F` and `R` as characteristics, `G` as the scope value, plus edge-scoped `CL`; the aggregation rules stay conservative, respect the current composition, transformation, temporal, and work invariants named by their governing patterns, and keep the A.7 EntityOfConcern and description strict distinction. It treats the E.14 Working-Model layer as the publication-facing assertion layer for claims, with assurance inputs attached downward from Mapping, Logical, Constructive, and Empirical Validation layers.

**Use this when.** Use `B.3` when a claim, label, dashboard, evidence bundle, model, report, gate decision, or assurance-input package is being used to raise assurance, trust, readiness, compliance, safety, release confidence, `F`, `G`, `R`, or `CL` for a named claim.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Labels, dashboards, model cards, credentials, provenance marks, gate decisions, or evidence bundles start raising trust or readiness without one typed assurance claim, named evidence, scope, limitations, decay, and relying context.

**What this buys.** Assurance becomes a conservative typed claim over `F`, `G`, `R`, and edge-scoped `CL`, with explicit evidence, scope, time, limitations, contestability, and stop or reopen conditions.

**First output.** Write one typed `Assurance(H, C | K, S)` claim per named assurance claim `C`, or write an explicit no-assurance-claim disposition when the encountered publication face, rendering, cue, evidence pointer, wording issue, gate decision, role assertion, status-value assertion, commitment, or work occurrence does not carry an assurance claim.

**Not this pattern when.** If the encountered source or publication face is only a cue, action invitation, boundary wording, evidence question, currentness question, gate decision, release decision, role assertion, status-value assertion, commitment, or work occurrence, use `A.15`, `A.6`, `A.10`, `A.21`, `A.20`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, or `A.15.1` as appropriate.

**Assurance result selection.** Use the lightest assurance result that can decide the assurance use being claimed. A cue or source pointer gets no B.3 tuple. A local, non-release, non-compliance, non-safety, non-reused claim may be written as a compact bounded assurance claim statement that names claim, assurance use carried by the assurance tuple or relying context, evidence pointer, limit, and stop or reopen condition. Reserve a full typed `Assurance(H, C | K, S)` claim for readiness, compliance, safety, release confidence, trust, `F`, `G`, `R`, `CL`, or reused assurance input.

**Assurance claim over time.** Treat an assurance claim as time-bounded and updateable: it can decay, reopen, narrow, or be withdrawn, not remain a one-time checklist result. For model, data, AI, documentation, release, or operational assurance, name the drift, monitoring, incident, evidence refresh, version change, policy change, gate change, or residual unsupported-use condition that reopens the assurance claim.

### B.3:1 - Problem frame

Every non‑trivial result in FPF—*a composed system is safe*, *a model is credible*, *a conclusion holds*—is a **claim** that rests on **composed evidence**.

* For **U.System** holons, assurance is about *capabilities and constraints* under stated conditions.
* For **U.Episteme** holons, assurance is about the *quality of evidence relation* for a statement or model.

To make such claims comparable and auditable across domains, B.3 introduces a **Trust and Assurance Calculus** that:

* uses a **small typed assurance tuple** (F-G-R: `F` and `R` as characteristics plus `G` as scope value) governed by conservative propagation rules; this tuple is **not** a state space,
* accounts for **integration quality** via **Congruence Level (CL)** along the edges of a `DependencyGraph` (B.1.1, A.14),
* and composes these values only through current governing composition, transformation, temporal, and work operators while respecting their declared invariants.

B.3 is **conceptual and normative**: it defines *which assurance components must be published and how they propagate*. How those components improve (for example by formalizing, replicating, reconciling, or widening or narrowing scope under declared operation rules) is handled by KD-CAL improvement moves; those knowledge-dynamics references are descriptive, not required to read here.

**Mechanism linkage.** For law-governed operation families (for example **USM** and **UNM**) authored as **mechanisms**, use A.6.1 — U.Mechanism to publish **OperationAlgebra**, **LawSet**, **AdmissibilityConditions**, and the **Transport** clause (Bridge-only; `CL`, `CL^k`, and `CL^plane`). All such penalties reduce `R_eff` only; `F` and `G` remain invariant.

**Working-Model handshake (alignment with E.14, B.3.5, and C.13).**
Assurance consumes two inputs declared in the **Working-Model** assertion layer (CT2R-LOG, B.3.5): the **justification declaration** `validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}` and, where present, the **grounding link** `tv:groundedBy`. Structural claims that aspire to the strongest guarantees rely on **Constructive** grounding as a constructive-composition narrative referenced via `tv:groundedBy`. No assurance record or publication **defines** Working-Model wording or layout; dependence remains downward-only under E.14.

### B.3:2 - Problem

Without a disciplined calculus, four chronic failures appear:

1. **Trust inflation:** Averaging or summing heterogeneous “quality” tags yields aggregates that look better than their weakest parts, violating WLNK.
2. **Scale confusion:** Mixing ordinal and ratio scales (e.g., averaging `F` ordinal scale values with numeric reliabilities) produces meaningless numbers.
3. **Congruence blindness:** Integration quality (how well pieces fit) is invisible; brilliantly strong parts connected by weak mappings produce overconfident wholes.
4. **Scope drift:** Design-time formalism and run-time evidence are composed into a single score; dashboards then claim “assurance” for a blueprint using run-time data, or vice versa.

### B.3:3 - Forces

| Force                                    | Tension                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conservatism vs. Synthesis**           | Avoid overclaiming (WLNK) ↔ recognize real gains from better integration (raise CL) or true emergence (B.2).                            |
| **Universality vs. Domain nuance**       | One calculus for systems and epistemes ↔ physics and epistemology use different primitives; keep them comparable but not identical. |
| **Simplicity vs. Fidelity**              | Keep the assurance tuple small and typed (A.11) ↔ capture enough structure to be informative and improvable by KD-CAL moves.           |
| **Static clarity vs. Dynamic evolution** | A score must be reproducible today ↔ tomorrow it should legitimately rise after formalization, replication, or reconciliation.      |

### B.3:4 - Solution — **Part 1: The assurance tuple and the universal aggregation skeleton**

B.3 defines **what** the assurance components are, **where** they are assigned on nodes and edges of the dependency graph, and the **shape** of the aggregation that any Γ-flavour must honor when producing an *assurance result*.

#### B.3:4.1 - The F-G-R assurance components (typed; `F` and `R` as CHR, `G` as USM)

We standardize **two node characteristics**, **one node scope value**, and **one edge characteristic**:

1. **Formality (F)** — *how constrained the reasoning is by explicit, proof-grade structure.*

   * **Scale kind:** **ordinal** (its scale values do not admit arithmetic).
   * **Canonical scale values (example):**
     `F0 Informal prose` - `F1 Structured narrative` - `F2 Formalizable schema` - `F3 Proof-grade formalism`.
   * **Monotone direction:** higher is better (never lowers assurance when all else fixed).

2. **ClaimScope (G)** — *the declared set of `U.ContextSlice` values where the result applies.*

   * **Type:** **set-valued USM scope value** (A.2.6), **not** a CHR characteristic.
   * **Well-typed operations:** **membership** and **set algebra** (`∈`, `⊆`, `∩`, `⋃`, `SpanUnion`, plus declared Bridge translation, widening, narrowing, or refit operation).
   * **Scalar proxy (report-only):** if a G scope report needs a number, it may publish an explicitly declared **CoverageMetric(G)**; such a proxy must not replace G in norms, gates, bridge semantics, or CL-bearing relation decisions.

3. **Reliability (R)** — *how likely the claim or behavior holds under stated conditions.*

   * **Scale kind:** **ratio** in `[0,1]` (or a conservative ordinal proxy when numeric modeling is unavailable).
   * **Monotone direction:** higher is better.

4. **Congruence Level (CL)** — *edge property: how well two parts fit* (semantic alignment, calibration, interface standard).

   * **Scale kind:** **ordinal** with a **monotone penalty function** `Φ(CL)` where `Φ` decreases as CL increases.
   * **Canonical scale values (example):**
     `CL0 tentative guess` - `CL1 plausible mapping` - `CL2 validated mapping` - `CL3 verified equivalence`.
   * **Interpretation:** low CL reduces the credibility of the *integration itself* (not the parts), and therefore **penalizes** the aggregate **R**.

> **EntityOfConcern and description strict distinction (A.7).**
>
> * Assurance components are recorded as **value and scope claim components**: `F` and `R` as characteristics, `G` as a scope value, while the governing composition, order, temporal, and work patterns keep **structure, order, and time** distinct.
> * Do not smuggle assurance components into structural edges; keep `F`, `R`, and `CL` explicit as CHR metadata and `G` explicit as a USM scope value.

> **Assurance shoulders (Working-Model split).**
> **Mapping** raises **TA** (typing, fit, and CL). **Logical** and **Constructive** contribute to **VA** (intended relation semantics; constructive-composition identity for structure when the governing pattern admits it). **Empirical Validation** contributes to **LA** (evidence in a bounded context). These assurance inputs attach **downward** from the Working-Model assertion layer (E.14).

#### B.3:4.2 - Assurance as a typed claim

B.3 speaks about **assurance of a specific typed claim** `C` over a holon `H` under context `K` and scope `S ∈ {design, run}`:

```
Assurance(H, C | K, S) = ⟨F_eff, G_eff, R_eff, Notes⟩
```

* `C` examples: *meets load L*, *argument Q holds*, *model M predicts within δ*.
* `K` binds assumptions (environment, usage, priors).
* `Notes` include carrier/source-currentness records, evidence-provenance references (A.10), **OrderSpec** or **TimeWindow** where applicable, cutsets, and evidence citations.

This tuple gives practitioners an at-a-glance assurance result while preserving the pieces needed for audit and improvement.

**Validation modes (declaration, normative).**
Each published Working-Model assertion declares **`validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}`** (E.14).

* *postulate* -> pragmatic working claim; **Empirical Validation** is required for audit.
* *inferential* -> reasoned consequence; **Logical** assurance carries the reasoning requirement.
* *axiomatic* -> constructive identity; **structural** edges provide a constructive-composition narrative and a **`tv:groundedBy`** pointer (C.13, B.3.5).

**Design versus run (no chimeras).** Assurance tuples for **design-time** and **run-time** are reported **separately** and are not composed into a single score; see the *Scope drift* hazard in B.3:2 and the obligations in B.3:4.6.

#### B.3:4.2a - Authority-looking labels and dashboard tiles

A badge, label, score, dashboard tile, credential display, provenance mark, compliance-looking mark, model card, datasheet, data card, assurance document, attestation label, assurance-looking note, or generated confidence phrase does not enter assurance calculus or improve `F`, `G`, `R`, `CL`, readiness, safety, compliance, trust, release confidence, or assurance by display alone.

**Adversarial misuse guard.** Do not let dashboards with favorable labels, compliance-looking badges, old model cards, provenance labels, assurance-looking documents, or generated confidence phrases supply missing evidence, limitations, scope, decay, or argument for an assurance claim.

B.3 dispositions for such a source or publication face are:

| Disposition | Use when | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No assurance use | The encountered source or publication face is only a cue, source pointer, evidence question, currentness question, gate decision, role assertion, status-value assertion, commitment, boundary wording, or work occurrence. | Use `A.15`, `A.10`, `A.6`, `A.21`, `A.20`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, or `A.15.1`; no tuple is needed. |
| Compact bounded assurance claim statement | The claim is local, non-release, non-compliance, non-safety, not reused as assurance input, and does not affect a people or team status value. | Record the claim, assurance use carried by the assurance tuple or relying context, evidence pointer, limit, and stop or reopen condition in the current work record. |
| Full assurance tuple | The source or publication face is being used to raise readiness, compliance, safety, release confidence, trust, `F`, `G`, `R`, or `CL`. | One typed `Assurance(H, C &#124; K, S)` claim per named assurance claim `C`, with argument, evidence, limitations, and decay condition. |
| Rejected or narrowed assurance claim | Evidence, scope, argument, currentness, or limitations do not carry the attempted assurance claim. | State the assurance claim, work claim, or reliance claim that the current assurance tuple does not carry, then name the next legitimate formalization, evidence repair, scope narrowing, or claim narrowing move. |

Build a `B.3` assurance claim only when the next work occurrence or reliance use depends on a typed assurance claim. The typed assurance claim names:

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Claim and assurance use carried by the tuple | The claim named by value `C` and the assurance use the tuple carries: readiness, release, audit, compliance, safety, model credibility, or another named assurance use. |
| Holon, context, and scope | `H`, `K`, and `S` plus audience or relying context when the label is human-facing. |
| Evaluation condition | What was evaluated, under which method, policy, test, audit, measurement, or assurance case. |
| Evidence relation and evidence refs | The `A.10` evidence-provenance path, scoped evidence refs, source-maintenance role assignments, windows, verifier rule, relying-party rule, and proof results or status-value results that evidence the assurance tuple. |
| Argument and assurance rationale | The argument pattern, assurance case, or reason why the evidence relation evidences claim `C` under `K` and `S`, including assumptions, defeaters, and contestable challenges. |
| Limitations and rival explanations | Scope limits, claims or uses not carried by the assurance tuple, stale display, spoofing, copied text, generated text, proxy-for-value substitution, provenance-only source relation, context shift, and known failure conditions. |
| Decay and reopen condition | Valid-until, revocation, policy version, gate version, model version drift, monitoring change, incident signal, evidence refresh, and contest or redress relation. |

**Assurance evidence minimization.** A typed assurance result cites the minimum `A.10` evidence-provenance path needed for the named assurance claim and relying context. Use redacted, hashed, scoped, or role-mediated evidence refs when raw evidence records would expose personal data, secrets, privileged logs, tenant identifiers, security-sensitive traces, incident details, or unnecessary identities; do not build a full assurance dossier when pointers preserve enough recoverability.

Viewpoint prompts for assurance use:

| Role in the situation | Prompt |
| --- | --- |
| Assurance steward | Which named `Assurance(H, C &#124; K, S)` claim is being made or revised? |
| Audit role | Which evidence-provenance path, argument, limitation, decay condition, reopen condition, and relying context must be recoverable? |
| Manager or release role | Which desired decision or work or reliance use is outside B.3 and must instead use `A.15`, `A.21`, `A.10`, or another named source? |
| Model or data steward | Which documented bounded-use statement or external intended-use field, evaluation condition, version, window, limitation, drift, and incident condition bound the model or data documentation? |
| Evidence source-maintenance role assignment | What evidence ref or scoped pointer must be exposed without turning documentation presence into an assurance claim? |

Display guidance for assurance labels: a readiness, safety, compliance, trust, release-confidence, or assurance display should show the named assurance claim, assurance use carried by the assurance tuple or relying context, evaluation condition, evidence-provenance ref, scope, window, limitation, decay condition, reopen condition, and assurance, work, or reliance claims not carried by the assurance tuple. A label that only points to documentation should remain a source pointer, not an assurance result.

Incident-learning fields for assurance overread: visible label, documentation record, attempted assurance claim, missing tuple or evidence-provenance field, assurance claim, work claim, or reliance claim not carried by the assurance tuple, limitation or decay condition that defeated the claim, next legitimate formalization, evidence repair, scope narrowing, or claim narrowing move, and upstream repair record for documentation, evidence refs, assurance label wording, monitoring, or reopen trigger.

Contestability and redress relation: when the B.3 material-reliance threshold is met, the B.3 result should name the claim being contested, evidence-provenance path, limitation or decay condition, contest forum or decision forum, safe interim disposition, and what evidence or scope change would reopen the assurance claim.

If those fields are missing, the encountered publication face, rendering, or cue remains an orientation label, source pointer, evidence pointer, documentation record, or unsubstantiated confidence cue. Use `A.15` when the question is whether that lane may guide work or reliance, `A.10` when the question is evidence, currentness, or provenance, and `A.6` when the question is mixed policy, API, or schema wording.

**Positive repaired assurance statement.** When the assurance use being claimed and the required assurance fields are present, write the smallest typed assurance result that can guide work or reliance: the named claim, context, scope, evaluation condition, evidence-provenance path, argument, limitations, decay condition, and reopen condition. That result may improve or justify assurance only for the stated claim and scope; other gate, evidence, work-occurrence, or compliance uses still need their own named sources.
Constructive assurance moves:

- narrow `G` to the evidenced or rule-bounded scope;
- raise `F` by formalizing argument structure, method-description fields, or `MethodRelationStructure@BoundedContext` when method composition, fallback, selection, or method-family relation is current;
- raise `R` by adding validation, replication, more probative, repeated, current, or more relevant evidence;
- improve `CL` by repairing mappings, units, interfaces, or integration edges;
- separate design assurance from run assurance;
- add limitations, assumptions, defeaters, monitoring, drift, and reopen triggers;
- reject or downgrade the assurance use when those moves are not available.

Negative controls:

| Visible source or publication face | Bounded source or assurance use | Unsupported use without a typed assurance claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source-backed release dashboard tile | If the tile is a current view of `A.21` `GateDecision` or `DecisionLogRef` plus an `A.10` evidence-provenance path, it may carry gate-passage reliance outside B.3 for the named release and environment. B.3 is used only when the tile is also asked to raise readiness, safety, compliance, trust, or release-confidence assurance. | Release approval by display, compliance proof, rollback success, work occurrence, or assurance increase without a typed assurance claim. |
| Credential, compliance, or provenance label | Bounded source, holder, status value, history, or documentation source relation when evidenced. | Safety, truth, permission, gate passage, readiness, or assurance claim by label presence. |
| Model card, datasheet, data card, assurance document, or assurance-looking note | Scoped documentation for a named claim, documented bounded-use statement or external intended-use field, evaluated condition, limitation, version, and window. | Higher `R`, broader `G`, higher `F`, better `CL`, readiness, compliance, safety, or release confidence by document presence. |
| Generated confidence phrase | Source-finding or explanation relation when grounded. | Assurance increase, authority, approval, or evidence by wording alone. |

Model cards, datasheets, data cards, assurance documents, and assurance-looking notes are external documentation records or source records unless they are mapped into existing `FPF` claims and publication faces. They do not add MVPK face kinds and do not bypass `B.3` when the use under repair is an assurance claim.

**Lint trigger.** A model card, datasheet, or data card cited as readiness, safety, compliance, release confidence, or assurance proof requires documented intended-use match, evaluation condition, limitations, an `A.10` evidence-provenance path, and one typed `Assurance(H, C \| K, S)` claim for the named assurance claim. Without those, classify the use as `no assurance use` or as a rejected or downgraded assurance claim.

Positive repaired example: a model card plus documented bounded-use statement or external intended-use field, evaluation condition, version, window, limitations, an `A.10` evidence-provenance path, and a typed `Assurance(H, C \| K, S)` claim may carry assurance for that named model claim in that evaluated context. The same documentation still does not carry another deployment context, gate passage, release work occurrence, or compliance proof unless those sources are separately present.

#### B.3:4.2b - Minimum reliance safety assurance record

Use this B.3 section when the B.3 material-reliance threshold is met: reliance on a visible carrier, source reference, publication face, or display may materially change behavior, safety, release, compliance, public or protocol behavior, access, resource allocation, people or team status value, operational action, or controlled-entity regulation. The first B.3 move is to decide whether an assurance claim is being made; if it is, write the minimum reliance safety assurance record for the named reliance use. Mere attention shift, learning, orientation, source-finding, or source-wording correction is not enough.

`RelianceSafetyCase` is the local Tech label for this B.3 assurance-record form. The plain phrase is **minimum reliance safety assurance record**. The label is not a new FPF pattern, Core kind, safety authority, gate, policy source, approval, certificate, compliance method, or general safety-case ontology.

Assurance-record use: the trigger and non-trigger table is a B.3 recognition aid, the minimum assurance-record table is a minimum local record aid, and the worked reliance-threshold slices are examples for users of the pattern. They are not a universal project checklist, sign-off sequence, untyped status vocabulary, or replacement for `Assurance(H, C | K, S)`; use them only when the named material reliance trigger is met. This local section keeps the attempted reliance inside the B.3 assurance relation; it does not create an extra SEMIO authority or cross-pattern relation vocabulary.

Affordability card: orientation or source-finding stays outside B.3; bounded local reliance stays with the local evidence, explanation, CV, gate, or pattern-quality relation unless an assurance claim is being made; threshold reliance uses the minimum reliance safety assurance record only when the B.3 material-reliance threshold is met. Plain wording remains ordinary unless it changes bounded use, source relation, evidence, gate, assurance, work, decision, or selected governing pattern.

Common wrong first classification: a safety-looking note, safety case, compliance-looking label, or dashboard warning is a certificate, approval, or gate. First honest entry: state one typed B.3 assurance claim with A.10 evidence-provenance path, assumptions, limitations, defeaters, residual uncertainty, monitoring or stop condition, contest and redress relation, bounded assurance use, and unsupported attempted use.

First B.3 move: name the reliance use, the assurance claim, the affected context or audience, the trigger that meets the B.3 material-reliance threshold, the A.10 evidence-provenance path, the argument, limitations, defeaters, contest and redress relation, stop or monitoring condition, bounded assurance use, and unsupported attempted use. If those pieces are absent, use `A.10`, `E.17.EFP`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `E.19`, or the local relation that actually governs the source use rather than inventing assurance by label.

Trigger and non-trigger cases:

| Encountered source use | B.3 disposition | Minimum response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary source-backed report, citation, model card, datasheet, data card, or documentation record with no assurance use and no met B.3 material-reliance threshold | No B.3 assurance use. | Stay in `A.10` with claim, source record or publication face, evidence-provenance path, window, bounded evidence use, unsupported attempted use, and reopen trigger. |
| Generated explanation, generated summary, or didactic reconstruction used only for source-finding or learning | No B.3 assurance use. | Stay in `E.17.EFP` unless operative claims are relied on through `A.10` evidence-provenance paths or another source relation that carries or exposes the source basis for the operative claim. |
| Local conformance label, `CV.Status`, benchmark result, or score near a release conversation but not used to raise assurance | No B.3 assurance use. | Keep `CV.Status` in `A.20`, gate-decision publication in `A.21`, pattern-quality result in `E.19`, measurement or marker relation in `C.16` or `A.10`, and no assurance tuple unless an assurance claim is being made. |
| Confidence, calibration, prediction interval, or abstention reason tied to one reversible local act | Compact bounded assurance claim only when the act depends on assurance; otherwise no B.3 use. | State act, context, window, calibration condition, stop condition, bounded evidence use, and unsupported attempted use; use `C.27` or `G.11` when time, expiry, refresh, or monitoring changes the action. |
| Safety-looking note, compliance-looking label, public warning, dashboard value, generated operational explanation, or status-value display is intended or reasonably foreseeable to meet the B.3 material-reliance threshold: reliance materially changes behavior, safety, release, compliance, public or protocol behavior, access, resource allocation, people or team status value, operational action, or controlled-entity regulation. | Minimum reliance safety assurance record is required. | Build the B.3 assurance record with A.10 evidence-provenance path and any relevant `A.20`, `A.21`, `E.19`, `C.27`, `G.11`, `B.2.5`, or representation and retargeting dependency. |

Minimum assurance record:

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Reliance use and assurance claim | The behavior, safety, release, compliance, public or protocol behavior, access, resource allocation, people or team status value, operational action, or controlled-entity regulation that would materially change, and the assurance claim being made about that change. |
| Context, audience, and affected role | The bounded context, environment, user group, team, public audience, relying role, affected role, tenant, release line, service, or work occurrence being guided. |
| Source relation or carrier record and evidence kind | The visible carrier, source reference, publication face, record, cue, marker, conformance label, dashboard, explanation rendering, score, warning, or status-value display, plus the evidence kind being used. |
| A.10 evidence-provenance path | Claim, source record or source relation, producer or method trace, currentness and window, source-maintenance role assignment, evidence relation, rival explanation, bounded evidence use, unsupported attempted use, and reopen trigger. |
| Argument and assurance relation | Why this evidence-provenance path carries the assurance claim under the context; include assumptions, limitations, defeaters, residual uncertainty, and unacceptable-harm or risk-tolerance condition when relevant. |
| Dependencies | Any relevant `A.20` CV status, `A.21` gate decision, `E.19` pattern-quality result, `C.27` temporal claim, `G.11` refresh and decay relation, `B.2.5` control relation, or representation and retargeting relation. |
| Monitoring, rollback, or stop condition | What observation, incident, drift, contest, expiry, changed C.28 identification or realizability profile, changed A.21 gate profile, changed evaluation condition, changed source record, or failed check stops, narrows, reopens, or withdraws the reliance. |
| Contest and redress | The disputed claim or disposition, affected use or harm, accountable review role, challenge evidence admitted by the contest relation, possible disposition change, outcome record, and reopen trigger. |
| Public and protected evidence boundary | Public summary, protected evidence reserved for an accountable review role, affected-party contestable minimum, and any scoped, redacted, hashed, or role-mediated evidence ref needed to preserve recoverability without overexposure. |

Positive repaired assurance result: when the threshold is met and the assurance record is sufficient, write the smallest typed assurance result that can guide the reliance: named assurance claim, reliance use, context, evidence-provenance path, argument, limitations, dependencies, monitoring or stop condition, contest and redress relation, bounded assurance use, and unsupported attempted use. When the record is insufficient, narrow the reliance, degrade the assurance use, abstain, require evidence, reopen the source, or block the attempted assurance use; do not convert a polished source into safety acceptance.

A safety case is accepted only as a bounded assurance argument for the named reliance use. It remains contestable by defeaters, changed evidence, changed context, monitoring failure, residual-uncertainty breach, or affected-party challenge admitted by the contest relation. Stop when the named reliance use, unsupported attempted use, limitations, defeaters, contest and redress relation, monitoring or rollback condition, and reopen condition are sufficient for this threshold trigger; do not expand the record into a general safety dossier.

Accountable review is insufficient by title alone. It counts here only when it can change the disposition, records the outcome, and leaves the bounded assurance use, unsupported attempted use, and reopen condition inspectable.

Misuse guard: an incoming or attempted-reliance `RelianceDisposition=safety-case-required` must name the trigger that meets the B.3 material-reliance threshold. A source producer, dashboard-value publisher or maintainer, model producer, documentation producer, or status-value label issuer cannot self-clear a threshold-bearing reliance by attaching the label. Where the B.3 material-reliance threshold is met, the assurance record must expose an accountable review role and a contest relation capable of changing the disposition.

Affected-party contestable minimum: public and protected evidence separation is sufficient only if the affected party can see enough of the claim, source class, disposition, affected use, accountable role, and challenge evidence admitted by the contest relation to challenge the result. Protected evidence reserved for an accountable review role may stay protected, but protected evidence cannot make redress non-contestable while the assurance use still claims contest or assurance relation. A blocked, abstained, degraded, or evidence-needed assurance use is not final if challenge evidence admitted by the contest relation, missing affected-party evidence, changed source, changed context, monitoring failure, or redress can materially change the disposition.

Worked reliance-threshold slices:

| Slice | B.3 move | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A public-service or access status-value display changes who receives access, assistance, or review. | Use the minimum reliance safety assurance record for the named status-value-changing reliance, with contest and redress and unsupported attempted use. | The display is not approval, safety, fairness, compliance, or resource authority by itself. |
| An SRE dashboard changes incident behavior or resource allocation. | Use B.3 only when the dashboard is asked to raise assurance or safety-bearing reliance; keep ordinary evidence and currentness in A.10. | Use B.2.5 only for a control relation being claimed and A.21 only for a gate decision being claimed. |
| A public warning or synthetic-content label changes perceived meaning but there is no evidence that it changed the behavior claimed to change, release risk, safety claim, or control relation. | Keep the label as A.10 evidence or source-finding and orientation cue; require audience-effect or behavior-effect evidence before B.3 reliance. | Do not infer safety, compliance, behavior change, or control effect from label presence alone. |
| A manufacturing conformance label appears near release. | Keep local CV or conformance evidence in `A.20`, `A.21`, `C.16`, or `A.10`; use B.3 only when assurance, safety, compliance, or release-confidence reliance is being claimed. | Conformance presence is not safety acceptance or release permission. |
| A software supply-chain attestation is cited as runtime safety. | Use `A.10` for origin, build, and process claims and B.3 only for the named assurance claim with argument, limitations, defeaters, and stop condition. | Build provenance is not runtime safety or operational permission. |
| A people or team status-value badge changes permissions, resources, or review priority. | Require an assurance record that names affected role, relying role, evidence-provenance path, contest relation, and disposition change condition. | The badge issuer cannot self-clear the people or team-status-value-changing reliance by issuing the badge. |
| A standards-document clause is reused as approval. | Use `A.10` for evidence of the clause; use the named approval, commitment, gate, or assurance relation only when that relation is being claimed by value. | A cited clause is not project approval, gate passage, or assurance by quotation. |

Do not treat the assurance record as a graded scale, standalone status value, universal assurance checklist, release certificate, or new safety-case disposition family. B.3 consumes the assurance record only as typed assurance input for the named claim and reliance use.

#### B.3:4.3 - Where the numbers are assigned (and where they are not)

* **On nodes:** each input holon contributes its local `F, G, R` according to its nature (system vs. episteme).
* **On edges:** each integration step has a `CL` (congruence of the connection).
* **Not inside Γ:** Γ consumes `D` and produces a composed holon; B.3 governs how `F, G, R, CL` **propagate** to the **Assurance** tuple for that composed holon. This keeps Γ algebra and assurance calculus **separable** and reviewable.
* **Not a state space:** `⟨F,G,R⟩` is an **assurance tuple**, not a `U.CharacteristicSpace`; do **not** draw “trajectories” in `⟨F,G,R⟩`. For episteme evolution, use **ESG** states and the **assurance‑trace** hooks (see below).

#### B.3:4.4 - Universal aggregation skeleton (domain‑neutral)

Any Γ‑flavour that claims an **Assurance** result **must** adopt the following **conservative skeleton**:

1. **Formality:**

   ```
   F_eff = min_i F_i
   ```

   *Rationale:* the least formal piece caps the formality of the whole (WLNK on F).
   *Monotone:* raising any `F_i` cannot reduce `F_eff`.

2. **ClaimScope (G):**

   ```
   G_eff(path)  = intersection({G_i | i is essential on the dependency path})
   G_eff(claim) = SpanUnion({G_eff(path_j)}) only across independently evidenced paths
   ```

   * Along an essential dependency path, every required evidence relation must hold on the same slice, so the effective claim scope is the intersection of the required scopes. Empty intersection means the path does not evidence the claim on any slice.
   * Across independent evidence lines for the same claim, B.3 may publish a `SpanUnion` of the path scopes, but only when the independence assumption and evidence relation are explicit.
   * **Constraint:** any region not covered by the required evidence relation for its path is dropped. A raw union of node scopes is never the default law for `G`.
   * *Monotone:* adding an independently evidenced path may widen the published claim scope; adding a new essential dependency may narrow it.

3. **Reliability (penalized by integration):**

   ```
   R_raw = min_i R_i                       # Weakest-link cap
   R_eff = max(0, R_raw − Φ(CL_min))       # Congruence penalty
   ```

   * `CL_min` is the **lowest** Congruence Level (`CL`) value on any edge in the proof spine or critical integration region for the claim `C`.
   * `Φ` is **monotone decreasing** and **bounded** (never makes negative values).
   * *Monotone:* increasing any `R_i` or any `CL` cannot lower `R_eff`.

4. **Evidence-source notes:**
   * The aggregate produces an assurance source-currentness record listing all contributing nodes and edges, with their F, G, R, CL, scopes, and evidence links (A.10).
   * The record also displays the **EntityOfConcernRef** (`entityOfConcernRef and groundingHolonRef`) and the **ReferencePlane** for the claim, and presents a separable TA, VA, and LA table of evidence contributions with valid-until or decay marks and the **Epistemic-Debt** per § B.3.4.
   * If order or time mattered for the claim, attach the OrderSpec or TimeWindow identifiers (B.1.4).

This skeleton is **mandatory**. Domain‑specific patterns may add **refinements** (e.g., separate epistemic “replicability” vs. “calibration”) as long as they **do not violate** WLNK or MONO and preserve scale kinds.

#### B.3:4.5 - System vs. Episteme - same shape, different interpretations

For **systems**:

  * `F` means **engineering discipline** (from ad-hoc method to verified specification).
  * `G` means **operational envelope coverage**.
  * `R` means **assured reliability** under `K` (requirements, environment, test campaigns).
  * `CL` covers interface verification or integration verification.

For **epistemes**:

  * `F` means **logical formality or semantic formality** (from prose to proof).
  * `G` means **domain span** (concepts, populations, conditions).
  * `R` means **evidential relation quality** (replication quality, measurement integrity).
  * `CL` covers vocabulary mapping quality and ontology mapping quality.

#### B.3:4.6 - Scale discipline (CHR guard‑rails)

To prevent silent misuse:

* **Ordinal scales (F, CL):** never average or subtract; use only `min`, `max`, thresholds, and monotone comparisons defined for ordinal scale values.
* **Coverage scales (G):** use union and intersection in a declared domain space; do not “average” sets. If a numeric proxy is used (e.g., coverage ratio), it **must** be derived from a set operation, not vice versa.
* **Ratio scales (R):** may be combined with `min`, `max`, or **explicitly justified** conservative functions; do not add R’s from different contexts without normalization of `K` (assumptions).

#### B.3:4.7 - What improves the tuple (improvement-pattern overview)

B.3 remains neutral about *how* improvement happens, but for didactic clarity:

* **Raise F:** formalize narratives (specifications, machine‑checked models).
* **Raise G:** enlarge evidence-covered span (new test regimes, new populations) with adequate evidence.
* **Raise R:** replicate, calibrate, tighten measurement error, reduce bias.
* **Raise CL:** reconcile vocabularies, align units, formalize mappings, verify interface Standards.

Each of these corresponds to recognizable `U.RoleAssignment` values, `U.Method` or `U.MethodDescription` changes, evidence-producing `U.Work`, and improvement moves. Their run-time counterparts are covered by temporal evidence and work-cost evidence under the governing temporal and work patterns.

#### B.3:4.8 - Prohibition (normative) — F–G–R is not a CharacteristicSpace

Do not treat `⟨F,G,R⟩` as a `U.CharacteristicSpace` and do not define geometric **trajectories** over it. Use **ESG** for episteme state and the **assurance‑trace** hooks for trends in assurance tuples.

#### B.3:4.9 - Assurance consequence for unsupported causal-use claims

`B.3` consumes `CausalUseSupportVerdict`, `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis`, and relevant profile refs from `C.28` and `A.10` when an assurance claim depends on a `C.28` causal-use verdict:

```text
CausalUseSupportVerdict = supported | bounded | unsupported | abstain
```

`CausalAssuranceTupleTrigger` is narrower than local causal-use repair. A local `C.28` downgrade, redirection to a relation governing the asserted use, or abstain disposition does not require a new `B.3` assurance tuple by itself. Create or update a `B.3` tuple only when the causal-use claim is assurance-bearing, publication-bearing, release-bearing, or reused as an input to assurance, trust, certification, risk acceptance, or downstream selection. Exploratory causal wording, local causal wording repair, or a `C.28` cheap stop remains outside `B.3` until it changes assurance or publication use.

An unsupported causal-use shift lowers, blocks, or abstains from `R` for the affected causal-use claim. If `CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile.verdict = nonrealizable`, `B.3` lowers or blocks `R` for claims that require direct counterfactual-comparison sampling evidence. If `CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile.verdict = unknown`, direct-realization claims are unsupported, while identified, bounded, or simulation-only bounded use may remain available when `C.28` declares the bounded use and unsupported use.

Verdict consequences:

| `CausalUseSupportVerdict` | Assurance consequence | Bounded assurance wording |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supported` | The causal-use claim contributes to `R` only inside the named `CausalUseSupportStatement`, scope `G`, `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis`, and cited profile refs. | "Supported only for the declared causal use under the cited `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis`, profile refs, and scope." |
| `bounded` | `R` is bounded to the declared bounded-use limit; assurance prose must name the bound, the `CausalUseSupportStatement`, and the `CausalUseUnsupportedStatement`, and must not imply unqualified causal use outside them. | "Bounded causal-use claim for the declared regime, population, policy, model, or window; unsupported outside that bound." |
| `unsupported` | The causal-use claim cannot raise `R`; it becomes `CausalUseUnsupportedStatement`, is downgraded, removed, or blocks the assurance claim when the causal use is necessary. | "Causal use unsupported for this assurance claim; use association-only, metric-only, or simulation-only wording or block the causal assurance claim." |
| `abstain` | No causal-use conclusion contributes to `R`; the assurance tuple either proceeds only on named non-causal grounds or abstains from the affected causal claim. | "No causal-use conclusion is used; assurance proceeds only on named non-causal grounds or abstains from this causal claim." |

What changes in practice: assurance prose cannot say "high confidence that the policy caused improvement" when the evidence-provenance path only evidences association or simulation-only counterfactual output; the unsupported causal-use step must degrade, abstain, or block the causal-use claim.

What this does not authorize: `B.3` does not determine the `C.28` target `CausalityLadderRung`, estimand, causal identification, evidence design, or realizability profile; it applies assurance consequences to the `CausalUseSupportVerdict` supplied by `C.28` and the evidence-provenance path supplied by `A.10`.

### B.3:5 Proof obligations (attach these when producing an Assurance tuple)

These obligations adapt the current B.1 and B.1.1 dependency-structure and relation-grounding checks for **assurance** outputs. Each Γ-flavour that emits an *Assurance(H, C | K, S)* tuple attaches the applicable obligations below.

#### B.3:5.1 - Common obligations (all Γ‑flavours)

* **ASS-CLM (Typed claim and context).**
  State the **claim** `C` (what is being assured), the **context** `K` (assumptions, environment), and the **scope** `S ∈ {design, run}`.

* **ASS‑SCA (Scale discipline).**
  Declare the **scale kind** used for each characteristic (F ordinal, G coverage, R ratio) and confirm that each operation is defined for that scale kind (no averaging of ordinals; G via set and coverage operations).

* **ASS‑WLNK (Weakest‑link evidence).**
  Identify the **cutset** (node or edge set) that caps `F`, `G`, and `R` for the claim (the proof spine for epistemes, the structural or assurance bottleneck for systems).

* **ASS‑CL (Congruence on integration dependency).**
  Identify the **relevant integration dependency path(s)** and record `CL_min` used in the penalty `Φ(CL_min)`.

* **ASS‑MAN (evidence-source record).**
  Produce an assurance source-currentness record listing all contributing nodes and edges with `(F, G, R)` and `CL` values, their **DesignRunTag**, and Evidence Graph Ref (A.10). If order or time affect the claim, include the **OrderSpec** or **TimeWindow** identifiers from the governing temporal or order pattern.

* **ASS‑MONO (Declared monotone characteristics).**
  List the characteristics along which local improvement cannot reduce the aggregate (this is used by future evolution, B.4).

#### B.3:5.2 - Γ\_sys (systems) — additional obligations

* **CORE‑BIC (Interface congruence).**
  Reference the **Boundary‑Inheritance Standard** (BIC) from **B.1.2** and record any interface mismatches; these contribute to `CL_min`.

* **CORE‑ENV (Operating envelope).**
  Specify the domain used for **G** (e.g., load–temperature region) and how coverage is computed (set union constrained by evidence relation).

#### B.3:5.3 - Γ\_epist (epistemes) — additional obligations

* **EPI‑SPN (Entailment spine).**
  Identify the **premise spine or lemma spine** for the claim; `R_raw = min R_i` is taken along this spine, not over arbitrary satellites.

* **EPI‑MAP (Semantic mapping congruence).**
  Point to the **vocabulary mappings and ontology mappings** used; their verification status sets the **CL** values on the integration edges.

#### B.3:5.4 - Γ\_ctx and Γ\_method (order‑sensitive) — additional obligations

* **CTX‑ORD (OrderSpec).**
  Attach the partial or total order `σ` and any **join-soundness** conditions (types, preconditions, and postconditions).
  (See B.1.4 for NC‑1..3 invariants; B.1.5 adds duration/capability typing.)

#### B.3:5.5 - Γ\_time (temporal) — additional obligations

* **TIME-COV (Coverage and identity).**
  Show that `PhaseOf` intervals cover the declared window without overlap for the **same phased entity**; justify any gap or overlap explicitly.

> **Note on Γ\_work.**
> Resource spending and efficiency belong in **Γ_work**. Their *measurement integrity* can influence **R** for a claim (e.g., if a reliability figure depends on calibrated energy input), but **costs themselves are not assurance**; keep them in Γ_work and cite their **measurement assurance** as inputs here.

### B.3:6 - Archetypal grounding (worked examples)

#### B.3:6.1 - System archetype — **Battery pack safety claim**

* **Claim `C`:** *Pack P meets discharge current L with thermal safety margin δ in environment K.*
* **Context `K`:** Ambient ≤ 35 °C; airflow ≥ X; duty cycle Y. Scope `S = run`.
* **Graph:** Cells `ComponentOf` modules `ComponentOf` pack; BIC exposes main power and thermal interface.
* **Inputs:**

  * `F` per node: module spec F2, cell test F1 → `F_eff = F1`.
  * `G`: operating envelope regions; union constrained by evidence relationed test regimes.
  * `R`: per‑module reliability from test data; cutset is **hot‑spot path** near weakest cell.
  * `CL`: interface congruence (sensor calibration CL2; thermal contact CL1).
* **Aggregation:**

  * `R_raw = min R_i` along the thermal cutset.
  * `R_eff = max(0, R_raw − Φ(CL_min=CL1))`.
  * `G_eff`: union of evidence-covered (L,T) rectangles, dropping regions lacking validated thermal data.
  * `F_eff = min(F_cell=F1, F_module=F2) = F1`.
* **Evidence/source record:** Evidence for calibration, test campaigns, BIC.
* **Improvement move:** raise `CL` (better thermal interface verification), raise `F` (formal thermal model), add evidenced envelope -> **R_eff** and **G_eff** increase monotonically.

#### B.3:6.2 - Episteme archetype — **Meta-analysis claim**

* **Claim `C`:** *Intervention X reduces outcome O by Δ on population P.*
* **Context `K`:** Inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, measurement protocol; `S = design`.
* **Graph:** Studies `MemberOf` evidence corpus; effect models `ConstituentOf` synthesis; mappings align different outcome scales.
* **Inputs:**

  * `F`: two RCTs at F3, one observational at F2 -> `F_eff = F2`.
  * `R`: replication quality per study -> weakest R on the entailment spine caps `R_raw`.
  * `CL`: mapping of scales (CL1 vs CL3).
  * `G`: populations union, but unevidence-covered sub-populations are dropped.
* **Aggregation:**

  * `F_eff = F2` from the weakest study-design evidence relation in the synthesis.
  * `R_eff = max(0, min(R_RCT1, R_RCT2, R_OBS) - Φ(CL_min=CL1))`.
  * `G_eff`: union of evidence-covered sub-populations; out-of-scope groups excluded.
  * `CL_min = CL1` for scale mappings; record the mapping witness and weakest-link study in the assurance source-currentness record.
* **Evidence/source record:** Data provenance, scale mappings, bias assessment, and proof-term hash for the effect-model equivalence when it is used constructively.
* **Improvement move:** upgrade mapping verification to CL2 or CL3; increase `F` via registered analysis plan; replicate lagging study.

#### B.3:6.3 - Order-sensitive manufacturing-sequence assurance

* **Claim `C`:** *The domain manufacturing sequence `R`, mapped to an order-sensitive Method/Work sequence with an `OrderSpec`, meets output defect rate <= epsilon.*
* **Context `K`:** Materials, equipment class; `S = run`.
* **Γ_ctx records:** `OrderSpec σ` for the method/work sequence; declared independent branches; join conditions at inspection.
* **Assurance:**

  * `R_raw = min R_step` along the declared order-sensitive dependency path (including inspection effectiveness).
  * Penalty from poor join soundness `CL_min`.
  * Improvement via faster but **verified** inspection (increase `R_step`) or tighter join spec (increase `CL`).

#### B.3:6.4 - Temporal archetype — **Model credibility across exact episteme identities**

* **Claims `C_i`:** each exact model episteme `M_i` carries its own prediction claim and declared applicability window; a receiving assurance use may additionally ask whether the selected claims jointly support prediction within ±δ over τ.
* **Context `K`:** data regime and drift tolerance; `S = run`.
* **C.2.1 identity and continuity:** compare the exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme for the items labelled v1, v2, and v3. A changed discriminator identifies another episteme. Assert `EpistemeEditionRelation(M_v1,M_v2)` or `EpistemeEditionRelation(M_v2,M_v3)` only when each ordered pair satisfies C.2.1's independent historical-continuation predicate; labels, revision Work, provenance, publication order, and common lineage establish neither occurrence.
* **Temporal aggregation:** a B.1.4/Γ\_time record may order those already recovered edition relations, applicability windows, or publication windows for the bounded assurance use. It does not turn the distinct epistemes into `PhaseOf` slices. If one exact episteme instead remains unchanged and the use needs proper interval restrictions, A.14 `PhaseOf(M@τ_i,M)` remains available and B.3 `TIME-COV` applies to that same phased entity.
* **Assurance:**

  * compute `R_raw = min(R_C1, R_C2, R_C3)` only when the named assurance use actually consumes all three exact edition-specific claims and their evidence relations;
  * apply the declared penalty when the mapping or calibration congruence between the edition-specific prediction/evidence bases is low;
  * re-calibration or a new validation campaign may improve the exact supported claim, mapping, or evidence relation, but creates neither episteme identity, edition continuity, currentness, nor publication availability; and
  * a non-continuing replacement receives an independent assurance assessment and inherits no `F`, `G`, `R`, `CL`, evidence, or reliance result by label.

### B.3:6.1 - Bias-Annotation

B.3 deliberately biases assurance toward conservative aggregation and explicit reliance use. This prevents dashboards, labels, badges, credentials, model cards, provenance marks, or generated confidence phrases from raising trust by appearance. The cost is that assurance claims need typed evidence, scope, limitations, decay, and contestability when they are used for readiness, safety, compliance, release confidence, or other material reliance.

### B.3:7 - Conformance checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC-B3.1** | An assurance result is a typed claim `Assurance(H, C &#124; K, S)` with `S ∈ {design, run}`. | Prevent scope drift and chimeras. |
| **CC-B3.2** | `F` is ordinal and uses thresholds or `min`; `G` is a USM scope value and uses membership, intersection along essential paths, and `SpanUnion` only across independent evidence lines; `R` is ratio and uses `min` plus conservative operations. | Preserve scale integrity (CHR and USM). |
| **CC-B3.3** | Congruence Level (`CL`) is assigned to edges; the penalty `Φ(CL)` is monotone decreasing and bounded (`R_eff ≥ 0`). | Make integration quality first-class. |
| **CC-B3.4** | `R_eff = max(0, min_i R_i - Φ(CL_min))` for the relevant integration dependency paths, unless a stricter domain-specific rule is justified. | Enforce WLNK and penalize low-CL integrations. |
| **CC-B3.5** | For `G`, essential dependency paths compose by intersection; `SpanUnion` applies only across explicitly independent evidence lines to the same claim and only over evidenced slices. | Prevent over-generalization. |
| **CC-B3.6** | An assurance source-currentness record lists node and edge values, Evidence Graph Ref, and any OrderSpec or TimeWindow identifiers; it also displays the `describe(EntityOfConcernRef->GroundingHolonRef)` binding for the claim, the declared ReferencePlane value of world, concept, or episteme, a separable TA, VA, and LA evidence breakdown per **CC-KD-08**, decay or valid-until indicators on empirical bindings, and the Epistemic-Debt tally from **B.3.4**. | Provide auditability through A.10 without collapsing evidence families. |
| **CC-B3.7** | Agency-characteristic values (A.13/C.9) do not override WLNK or `Φ(CL)` penalties; if agency grade change alters capabilities, model it as a Meta-Holon Transition. | Preserve safety; keep agency separate. |
| **CC-B3.8** | Design-time assurance and run-time assurance are kept in separate tuples and compared side by side when both matter. | Avoid design-time and run-time mixing. |
| **CC-B3.9** | If an assurance claim depends on a `C.28` causal-use verdict, it consumes `CausalUseSupportVerdict`, `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis`, and relevant profile refs from `C.28` or `A.10`; a causal-use claim whose C.28 verdict is unsupported degrades, blocks, or abstains rather than raising `R`. | Prevent assurance prose from certifying unsupported causal claims. |
| **CC-B3.10** | A local `C.28` downgrade, redirection to the relation governing the asserted use, or abstain disposition is not a new assurance tuple trigger unless the claim is assurance-bearing, publication-bearing, release-bearing, or reused as an assurance input. | Keeps cheap causal triage from becoming assurance ceremony. |
| **CC-B3.11** | A conforming `B.3` use does not treat a label, badge, dashboard tile, credential display, provenance mark, compliance-looking mark, model card, datasheet, data card, assurance document, attestation label, or generated confidence phrase as raising `F`, `G`, `R`, `CL`, readiness, safety, compliance, trust, release confidence, or assurance unless a typed `Assurance(H, C &#124; K, S)` claim and `A.10` evidence-provenance path name the claim, assurance use stated by the assurance tuple or relying context, scope, evaluation condition, evidence refs, argument and assurance rationale, limitations, decay condition, reopen condition, and relying context. | Blocks visible authority-looking labels from supplying false assurance relation. |
| **CC-B3.12** | When reliance on a source may materially change behavior, safety, release, compliance, public or protocol behavior, access, resource allocation, people or team status value, operational action, or controlled-entity regulation, the B.3 result provides a minimum reliance safety assurance record or explicitly rejects, narrows, degrades, abstains, or reopens the attempted assurance use. The local Tech label `RelianceSafetyCase` is not a certificate, approval, gate, policy source, Core kind, release permission, or general safety-case ontology. | Keeps safety-bearing reliance relation concrete without turning every source or publication face into a dossier or a new authority system. |

### B.3:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Averaging assurance** | Mean of `R_i` reported as system reliability | Use `min R_i` on the cutset, then apply `Φ(CL_min)`. |
| **Ordinal arithmetic** | Averaging `F` or `CL` to produce “2.3” | Use `min` or `max` or thresholds; never average ordinals. |
| **Coverage as centroid** | Replacing `G` union with a single “typical point” | Keep `G` as set and coverage; if a numeric proxy is needed, derive it from the set. |
| **Ignoring congruence** | No penalty for low-CL mappings or interfaces | Assign `CL` to integration edges and apply `Φ(CL_min)`. |
| **DesignRunTag chimera** | “One score” mixing blueprint and telemetry | Split into `S=design` and `S=run` tuples; compare explicitly. |
| **Agency override** | Claiming higher assurance because a controller is “clever” | Agency may justify how improvements are achieved; it cannot remove WLNK or `Φ`. |
| **MemberOf as stock** | Using `MemberOf` to sum reliabilities | Keep `MemberOf` for collections; reliability comes from the relevant Γ composition, such as the Γ_sys cutset. |
| **False assurance relation** | Badge, dashboard color, credential display, compliance mark, provenance label, model card, datasheet, data card, assurance document, attestation label, or generated confidence phrase is used as an assurance claim. | Keep it as orientation or source pointer unless a typed assurance claim and `A.10` evidence-provenance path make the intended assurance use bounded and evidenced. |
| **Minimum reliance safety assurance record inflation** | Ordinary evidence, source-finding explanation, local CV, documentation, or reversible local calibration use is forced into a safety assurance record; or the assurance record is used as approval, release permission, gate passage, safety acceptance, or compliance proof. | State the trigger that meets the B.3 material-reliance threshold. If the trigger is absent, use `A.10`, `E.17.EFP`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `E.19`, or the local relation that actually governs the use. If the threshold is met, write only the minimum assurance record and contest and redress relation needed for the named reliance use. |

### B.3:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Comparable, conservative, improvable.** The tuple ⟨F, G, R⟩ with **edge-scoped Congruence Level (`CL`) values** gives a compact, auditable view that improves monotonically under targeted moves (formalize, replicate, reconcile).
* **Cross-scale coherence.** Works for assemblies and arguments, methods and histories, without leaking order, time, or cost into structure.
* **Clear improvement moves.** It is obvious what to do to raise each component: raise `F`, `G`, or `R` locally, or raise `CL` on the integration edge.

**Trade‑offs**

* **More explicit metadata.** You must state scale kinds, cutsets, and mapping congruence; this is intentional transparency.
* **Conservatism may feel pessimistic.** True synergy appears only via **MHT** or after raising CL—never by arithmetic optimism.

### B.3:10 - Rationale

B.3 distills mature post‑2015 practice across several fields into a single, small calculus:

### B.3:10.1 - SoTA-Echoing

* **Assurance by weakest link** reflects reliability engineering and safety cases in complex systems; composing assurance evidence by minima prevents over‑statement.
* **Formality and verifiability** mirror advances in model‑based engineering and formal verification, where raising F turns subjective arguments into verifiable records.
* **Coverage as set and measure** follows evidence synthesis and validation practice that treat applicability as a domain region, not a scalar to “average.”
* **Congruence on edges** captures what meta‑analysis, interface control, and ontology alignment have repeatedly shown: integration quality is often the real bottleneck. Penalizing low‑CL is a principled way to prevent silent over‑confidence while rewarding verified reconciliation.
* **Assurance documentation, provenance, and release-status practice** treats labels, model cards, datasheets, C2PA provenance marks, SLSA and in-toto attestations, credential displays, generated confidence phrases, and dashboards as scoped documentation or source pointers, not automatic assurance claims. B.3 adopts claim, argument, and evidence discipline and scoped assurance-documentation use, adapts model cards, datasheets, data cards, attestations, provenance marks, dashboards, and generated confidence phrases as possible documentation or evidence inputs for a named assurance claim, and rejects visible-label promotion into readiness, compliance, safety, trust, `R`, `F`, `G`, `CL`, or release confidence without a typed tuple and A.10 evidence-provenance path.

Practical result from that safety-case and assurance-documentation practice: safety notes, compliance-looking labels, assurance documents, dashboards, provenance marks, model cards, datasheets, data cards, and generated confidence phrases do not become certificates, approvals, gates, safety acceptance, or assurance by appearance. The local B.3 result is one typed assurance claim or minimum reliance safety assurance record for the named reliance use, with `A.10` evidence-provenance path, assumptions, limitations, defeaters, residual uncertainty, monitoring or stop condition, contest and redress relation, bounded assurance use, unsupported attempted use, and reopen when evidence, source record, context, C.28 identification or realizability profile, A.21 gate profile, evaluation condition, monitoring, or challenge evidence admitted by the contest relation materially changes the disposition.

This arrangement preserves **A.11 Parsimony** (few characteristics), aligns with **A.14**, **A.7**, and **A.15** (clear separation of structure, order, time, cost, values), and leaves Context for domain-specific refinements that do not break the invariants.

### B.3:11 - Relations

* **Builds on:** B.1 where its current composition invariants are named by value, B.1.1 dependency-structure and relation-grounding checks, current system-composition, context, temporal, and work patterns when those operators are active, A.14 (Mereology), A.7 (EntityOfConcern and Description strict distinction), A.10 (evidence-provenance and carrier/source-currentness relations), A.15 (role, method, work-plan, and work alignment), A.2 and A.2.1 (role values and role assignments), A.3.4 (Transformation when actual change is current), and **C.13 (Compose-CAL)**.
* **Coordinates with:** **E.14 (Human‑Centric Working‑Model)** for publication-facing assertion discipline and **B.3.5 (CT2R‑LOG)** for Working‑Model relation label-meaning and grounding (`tv:*`, `validationMode`).
* **Coordinates with:** `C.28` for `CausalUseSupportVerdict`, `CausalityLadderRung`, `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis`, identification profile refs, realizability profile refs, supported causal use, and unsupported causal use; `A.10` for the evidence-provenance graph path carrying causal-evidence refs.
* **Coordinates with:** `A.15` for work disposition and reliance disposition, `A.6` for mixed authority wording, `A.21` for `OperationalGate(profile)`, `GateDecision`, and `DecisionLogRef`, `A.20` for `ConstraintValidity` status or witness, and `A.15.1` for release or deployment work occurrence. B.3 only handles typed assurance use; labels and evidence pointers stay with the source relation that governs them when assurance is not being claimed.
* **Used by:** KD-CAL improvement patterns (to plan improvements), B.4 (Evolution loops that raise `F`, `G`, `R`, or `CL` over time).
* **Triggers:** B.2 (Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT): Recognizing Emergence and Re‑identifying Wholes) when genuine new capabilities emerge that change the applicable cutsets or envelopes.

> **One‑page takeaway.**
> Report assurance as **⟨F, G, R⟩** for a **typed claim** under explicit **context and scope**, and penalize by the **lowest edge-scoped Congruence Level (`CL`) value**.
> Improve assurance by raising **F**, **G**, **R**, or **CL**—and keep order, time, and cost in their own lanes.

### B.3:11a - Assurance relation for quantum-like claims

Quantum-like wording does not raise the claim-assurance requirement by default. A local `C.26` modeling note can remain lightweight when it only prevents a representational mistake and is not used for a work-guiding use, reliance use, audit-closure claim, readiness-certification claim, or empirical-superiority claim.

Assurance-relation checks:

1. Decide the claim-assurance requirement before building assurance machinery.
2. If the QL note only prevents a local misinterpretation, keep it as QL-lite with ordinary evidence.
3. If the claim will be reused, state the governing FPF pattern, local stop condition, and evidence relation or evidence-provenance condition.
4. If the claim is used for release, readiness, audit, compliance, assurance, or threshold-bearing work or reliance, build the B.3 assurance claim over named evidence refs and scope.
5. If the claim says QL is better, faster, more accurate, or uniquely necessary, compare rival models, baseline, claimed mechanism, scope, and loss.
6. State decay conditions and reopen conditions so an old QL-evidenced assurance claim does not silently stay current after new validation observations, changed source records, changed evidence refs, or scope change.

| Claim-use requirement | B.3 expectation | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local modeling note | No assurance tuple beyond the ordinary pattern and evidence note | QL-lite note with local stop |
| Reusable example or pattern-facing note | Name the governing FPF pattern, local stop condition, and evidence relation or evidence-provenance condition | Reusable example with source relation |
| Decision, release, audit, readiness, or compliance use | Provide `F`, `G`, `R`, congruence relation, evidence refs, confidence, rival explanations, and decay or reopen conditions | Assurance tuple and evidence-provenance path |
| Comparative superiority claim | Add rival-model comparison, baseline, claimed mechanism, and scope limits | Bounded superiority claim or apply the FPF pattern that governs the comparison being claimed |

Useful outputs:

- no B.3 assurance use when QL is only a local representational lens;
- a compact bounded assurance claim statement when reuse is modest;
- a full assurance tuple only when consequence severity demands it;
- a rejected, narrowed, or withdrawn claim when evidence does not carry the claimed assurance use or relying context.

### B.3:11b - C.29 mathematical-lens use relation

> If a mathematical lens is used as input to assurance, readiness, reliability, release confidence, safety, trust, or engineering justification, write the assurance relation in `B.3` with the relevant evidence-provenance path and residual-use limits. A `C.29` output may be cited only as a lens-use result; mathematical elegance, validation regime, or a declared structure-preserving mapping does not raise assurance by itself. Evidence-provenance paths remain `A.10`; measurement construction and comparability remain `C.16`.
