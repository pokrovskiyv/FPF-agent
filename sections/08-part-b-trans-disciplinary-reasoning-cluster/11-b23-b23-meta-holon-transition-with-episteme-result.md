## B.2.3 - Meta-Holon Transition With Episteme Result

> **Type:** Part B holonic construction pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless a section is explicitly informative

### B.2.3:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when B.2 has identified one exact candidate new whole and that same individual must be recognized under the already admitted `U.Episteme` kind: a theory, model family, standard, doctrine, specification body, research programme, field-level knowledge body, or other claim-bearing non-agentive holon.

Use `B.2` first to decide whether whole reidentification is current and to identify the one candidate new whole. Use `B.2.3` only when its `resultHolonKindRef` resolves to `U.Episteme`.

**First useful move.** For B.2's exact candidate, identify one `U.ClaimGraph`, one exact EntityOfConcern, and one effective `U.ReferenceScheme`, then test whether their `EpistemeConstitutionRelation` obtains under C.2.1. Keep grounding, viewpoint, view, publication, source use, representation, evidence, and assurance in their neighboring direct relations.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A catalogue, literature review, dashboard, model repository, or vocabulary is called a new theory without claim-graph reidentification; or a real new episteme whole is treated as a pile of publications.

**What this buys.** The pattern preserves B.2 whole reidentification while keeping episteme ontology with C.2.1 and the episteme family. It prevents episteme-result MHT from becoming episteme agency, publication authority, generic emergence, or a second episteme ontology.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If the result whole is an acting physical or operational holon, use `B.2.2`.
- If the question is episteme constitution, empirical grounding, publication, source use, view, viewpoint, ClaimGraph, reference scheme, or description use without MHT, use `C.2.1`, `C.2.P`, `C.2.P.DR`, `E.17`, and the direct episteme-family owner.
- If the question is effect-free episteme morphing, viewing, retargeting, or controlled semantic coarsening, use `A.6.2`, `A.6.3`, `A.6.4`, or `A.6.3.CSC`.
- If the question is synthesis work, use `A.15.1` for performed work and `A.12` or `A.3.4` for acting-side and transformation claims.
- If the wording is ambiguous emergence-family language, use `B.2.P` before selecting B.2.3.

### B.2.3:1 - Problem Frame

A library is not a theory, and a theory is not its publication.

A group of papers, models, datasets, design notes, forecasts, standards, or local doctrines may remain a collection. B.2.3 becomes current only when B.2's exact candidate new whole can be constructively recognized under A.1 and the current C.2.1 constitution criterion identifies that same individual as one claim-bearing episteme.

B.2.3 introduces no special episteme result object. It retains B.2's one `resultHolonRef` and `resultHolonKindRef`, then returns episteme constitution and every neighboring relation to C.2.1 and its direct owners.

### B.2.3:2 - Problem

Without this specialization:

1. **Catalogues become theories.** Aggregated publications or dashboards are treated as a new episteme because they are stored together.
2. **Theory becomes publication.** The paper, report, standard document, model card, or dashboard is used as the episteme itself.
3. **Episteme receives agency.** The theory, standard, or doctrine is described as if it performs work or enforces behavior by itself.
4. **Morphing becomes MHT.** A view, retargeting, coarsening, translation, or model transformation is treated as a new episteme whole.
5. **Assurance is inherited silently.** Trust in constituent sources is treated as trust in the reidentified episteme whole.
6. **Generic emergence replaces claim structure.** "Emergent theory" hides the actual claim graph, reference scheme, and grounding relation.

### B.2.3:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Synthesis vs aggregation | A new episteme whole can integrate claims, but many collections remain indexes, reviews, or portfolios. |
| Episteme identity vs publication form | The episteme may be published in many forms; no publication form is the episteme by appearance. |
| Claim organization vs agency | An episteme can organize claims and guide use, but systems perform work with or on it. |
| Constituent evidence vs result assurance | Evidence for parts may bear on the result, but the result episteme needs its own claim and assurance relations. |
| Source mnemonic vs current ontology | Short labels can aid recognition while hiding whether the current object is B.2, C.2.1, A.6, E.17, or source-use. |

### B.2.3:4 - Solution

Use B.2.3 as the `U.Episteme` specialization of B.2. Reuse B.2's exact existing whole, exact candidate new whole, direct construction facts, and optional C.2.1 records; add no context-shaped slice or episteme-result schema.

#### B.2.3:4.1 - Reuse The B.2 Candidate And Complete Episteme Recognition

Keep B.2's one `resultHolonRef` for the candidate and its one `resultHolonKindRef`, which here resolves to the already admitted `U.Episteme` kind. Execute the complete A.1 criterion over that candidate, including the larger-assembly applicability and compatibility condition. Then apply C.2.1 to the same individual:

1. identify its exact claim content as one `U.ClaimGraph`;
2. identify the exact independently governed `U.Entity` that those claims concern;
3. identify the effective `U.ReferenceScheme` under which the claims are read about that entity; and
4. test whether the direct `EpistemeConstitutionRelation` among those participants obtains and yields one interpretable claim-bearing whole.

The candidate and its constitution relation are distinct, even though C.2.1 reidentifies them from the same participant triple. A card, tuple, repository, publication set, graph representation, or filled reference does not make the relation obtain. If A.1 or C.2.1 fails, do not identify the candidate as the episteme result; if a required dependency cannot be evaluated, return `unknown`.

#### B.2.3:4.2 - Keep Constitution And Neighboring Relations Separate

The exact ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme are the three participants of C.2.1's `EpistemeConstitutionRelation`. That constitution relation does not by itself identify A.1 constituents or constructive part relations. When A.1 requires those facts, recover them from an exact direct episteme-part or claim-composition owner. The EntityOfConcern remains an independently governed entity related through aboutness and reference. Keep all other current questions in their direct relations:

- empirical grounding uses `EpistemeEmpiricalGroundingRelation` only when designated empirical claims have current claim-to-world mappings involving the exact grounding holon;
- viewpoint selection and `U.View` recognition use their description-context and conformance owners;
- publication occurrence, publication form, carrier, source use, and C.29 representation remain distinct from the episteme and its constitution;
- synthesis work belongs to the acting system, method, work, and transformation owners; and
- evidence and assurance support or challenge exact claims but do not enter episteme identity or establish constitution.

Add only the neighboring object or relation required by the receiving use. Do not infer any of them from a publication set, and do not turn them into extra identity positions.

#### B.2.3:4.3 - Episteme Trigger Interpretation

When a receiving use has materialized B.2's optional `MHTTriggerProfile`, interpret its cues without giving agency to epistemes:

| Cue recorded in `MHTTriggerProfile` | Episteme-case reading | Direct owner kept visible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Delimitation change | The knowledge body now has a stable EntityOfConcern, scope, reference scheme, and claim scope. | `C.2.1`, `A.7`, source-use owners |
| Objective or evaluation change | The result episteme answers or evaluates a question that the collection did not answer as one claim-bearing whole. | `C.2.1`, `C.16`, `E.21` or relevant evaluation owner |
| Supervision or coordination change | Principles, axioms, invariants, reference schemes, or claim-graph constraints organize how constituent claims are interpreted. | `C.2.1`, `A.6.0`, `A.6.1`, `C.29` when formal lens is current |
| Capability or closure claim | The candidate episteme supports a new explanatory, predictive, specification, or coordination use; evidence for that claim remains separate. | `C.2.1`, `C.16`, `A.10` for evidence use, and the use-specific owner |
| Agency threshold | Usually not applicable to the episteme itself; if agency is claimed, recover the acting system in role. | `A.12`, `A.2.1`, `A.13`, `A.19`, `C.16` |
| Temporal consolidation | A field, standard, or theory becomes one current knowledge body after phase consolidation or source-currentness change. | `C.27`, `E.17`, source-use owners |
| Context reframe | New terms, reference schemes, or EntityOfConcern mapping reframe the knowledge body. | `C.2.1`, `A.6.3`, `A.6.4`, `F.18` |

These cues identify claims and relations to inspect. They neither constitute the candidate episteme nor select B.2; the direct facts, complete A.1 criterion, C.2.1 constitution test, and B.2 existing-whole/new-whole comparison decide the result.

#### B.2.3:4.4 - Blocked Readings

Do not use B.2.3 as:

- a name for generic emergence;
- an authority claim for a publication;
- an agentive claim about a theory, standard, or doctrine;
- an effect-free episteme morphism, view, retargeting, or coarsening;
- a second episteme ontic beside C.2.1;
- a shortcut from source synthesis to high trust;
- a replacement for source-use, evidence, assurance, or publication patterns.

### B.2.3:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Worked Cases)

#### B.2.3:5.1 - Reliability Doctrine

Before MHT, teams have local runbooks, incident reports, dashboards, and reliability definitions. They may be useful, but they are not yet one episteme.

After MHT, the exact candidate may be a reliability doctrine when it passes A.1 and its ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme stand in an obtaining C.2.1 constitution relation. Add empirical grounding to operating services, handbook publication, and source-use relations for standards or training materials only when the receiving use needs them.

- **Candidate new whole:** the reliability doctrine named by B.2.
- **A.1 basis:** exact constituents and obtaining constructive relations supplied by an exact direct episteme-part or claim-composition owner, a governed assembly and reidentification rule, a composition-grounded claim-bearing characteristic, and compatibility with an applicable larger knowledge-body construction rule.
- **C.2.1 constitution:** the doctrine's exact ClaimGraph states its principles and definitions; its EntityOfConcern is user-visible service harm and reliability; its effective ReferenceScheme supplies the reliability designations and interpretation rules.
- **Neighboring relations:** empirical grounding to operating services, handbook publication, source use for standards and training materials, and evidence or assurance are added only for the receiving use and do not identify the doctrine.

The doctrine does not enforce anything by itself. Systems in role use it, cite it, train with it, and work according to it.

#### B.2.3:5.2 - Model Family Becomes Theory

A model family can remain a toolbox. It becomes an episteme-result MHT only if B.2's candidate passes A.1 and one exact ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme stand in an obtaining C.2.1 constitution relation. Empirical grounding and explanatory or predictive use are checked through neighboring direct relations when the receiving use needs them; they are not extra identity constituents.

If the change is only a new model publication or benchmark score, use publication, source-use, measurement, evidence, and mathematical-lens owners instead.

#### B.2.3:5.3 - Standard Body

A set of clauses, examples, and annexes can become a standard episteme when the result is one claim-bearing whole with terms, references, scope, conformance claims, and publication forms.

The standard is not the committee, not the PDF, and not the work of enforcement. The committee is an acting system or role-bearing system; the PDF is a publication form; enforcement is work by systems in role.

### B.2.3:5.1 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias risk | Failure | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Library as theory | A repository, dashboard, or reading list is treated as one claim-bearing episteme. | Identify B.2's exact candidate, execute A.1, and test its C.2.1 ClaimGraph/EntityOfConcern/ReferenceScheme constitution. |
| Publication as episteme | A PDF, report, standard document, model card, or dashboard is treated as the episteme itself. | Keep publication forms with E.17 and source-use owners. |
| Episteme agency | A theory, standard, or doctrine is described as performing work or enforcement. | Recover acting systems, role assignments, methods, work, and evidence separately. |
| Morphing as MHT | View, translation, coarsening, or retargeting is called a new episteme whole. | Use A.6 episteme-morphism owners unless B.2 whole reidentification remains current. |
| Source trust transfer | Trust in constituent sources becomes assurance for the result episteme. | Rebuild assurance and source-use relations for the result episteme. |

### B.2.3:6 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-B2.3-1` | B.2 has left a whole-reidentification question before B.2.3 is used. |
| `CC-B2.3-2` | B.2's one exact candidate new whole passes the complete A.1 criterion and is independently recognized under the already admitted `U.Episteme` kind through current C.2.1 constitution. |
| `CC-B2.3-3` | No episteme-specific result reference, context-shaped slice, second result schema, or extra episteme identity positions are introduced. |
| `CC-B2.3-4` | Publication, source-use, view, viewpoint, claim-bearing, and representation questions return to C.2.1, E.17, C.2.P, C.2.P.DR, and direct episteme-family owners. |
| `CC-B2.3-5` | The episteme is non-agentive; acting systems, synthesis work, and enforcement work use A.12, A.2, A.15, A.15.1, or work owners. |
| `CC-B2.3-6` | Assurance for the result episteme is not silently inherited from constituent epistemes or publications. |
| `CC-B2.3-7` | Effect-free morphing, viewing, retargeting, and controlled coarsening are not treated as B.2.3 unless whole reidentification is current. |

### B.2.3:7 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Library as theory | A repository or reading list is treated as one episteme. | Recover one exact candidate and test A.1 plus the C.2.1 constitution relation; keep the collection if either test fails. |
| PDF as episteme | A publication form is used as the theory itself. | Use publication owners for the PDF and keep B.2's `resultHolonRef` for the independently constituted episteme. |
| Doctrine receives agency | "The standard enforces..." or "the theory decides..." | Recover the acting system, role, method, work, evidence, or decision claim. |
| Morphism as MHT | A view, translation, coarsening, or retargeting is called a new episteme whole. | Use A.6.2, A.6.3, A.6.4, or A.6.3.CSC unless B.2 whole reidentification is current. |
| Synthesis as high trust | A new theory inherits trust because its sources were reliable. | Rebuild assurance for the result episteme through A.10, B.3, B.3.5, C.2.1, and source-use owners. |

### B.2.3:8 - Consequences

Positive consequences:

- Episteme-result MHT becomes usable without preserving title mnemonics as ontology.
- C.2.1 remains the episteme ontic owner.
- Publications, source use, synthesis work, evidence, assurance, and acting systems remain separate.

Costs:

- A claimed synthesis must identify and test the current C.2.1 constitution, not only cite a portfolio.
- Result-episteme assurance requires fresh relation work.
- Some "new theory" claims return to publication, source-use, morphism, benchmark, or evidence owners.

### B.2.3:9 - Rationale

Knowledge synthesis can create a new holon, but only when the result is a reidentified claim-bearing episteme. B.2.3 keeps that useful case and removes the drift toward episteme agency, publication authority, generic emergence, and duplicate episteme ontology.

This pattern is deliberately thin. B.2 owns whole reidentification; C.2.1 owns the ClaimGraph/EntityOfConcern/ReferenceScheme constitution relation and episteme identity; publication and source-use patterns own their relations; A.6 episteme-morphism patterns own morphing and retargeting; A.15 and A.12 own synthesis work and acting systems.

### B.2.3:10 - SoTA-Echoing

| Source family | Lesson for B.2.3 | FPF decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Evidence synthesis and living-review practice | Synthesis claims need explicit scope, evidence relation, currentness, and maintenance rather than narrative authority. | B.2.3 requires current C.2.1 constitution and keeps assurance and source use in neighboring relations. |
| Knowledge-graph and claim-network practice | A knowledge body can be represented as related claims, evidence, and sources. | The actual ClaimGraph is a C.2.1 constitution participant; its graph representation, evidence, and sources do not declare MHT or add episteme identity positions. |
| Science-of-science and paradigm-change studies | Fields and theories can consolidate into named bodies with new scope and organizing principles. | B.2.3 treats consolidation as a cue to inspect; it neither constitutes the candidate episteme nor selects B.2. |
| Publication and standards practice | Standards, reports, models, and dashboards are carriers and publication forms. | E.17 and source-use owners remain separate from the episteme whole. |

### B.2.3:11 - Relations

- **Specializes:** `B.2` for an exact candidate new whole independently recognized under the already admitted `U.Episteme` kind.
- **Builds on:** `B.2` for the exact candidate new whole and whole reidentification, `A.1` for candidate recognition, `C.2.1` for the obtaining ClaimGraph/EntityOfConcern/ReferenceScheme constitution relation, and `E.24.UK` for prior public-kind admission.
- **Coordinates with:** `C.2.P`, `C.2.P.DR`, `E.17`, `E.17.*`, `A.6.2`, `A.6.3`, `A.6.4`, `A.6.3.CSC`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `B.3.5`, `C.29`, `F.18`, and `F.19`.
- **Uses:** `B.2.P` when source wording such as emergence-family or title-mnemonic wording hides the claim kind.
- **Contrasts with:** `B.2.2` for system-result MHT and `B.2.4` for capability and functioning whole-reidentification evidence.
