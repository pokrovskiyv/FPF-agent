## A.6.S - TargetSignature and optional ConstructorSignature - demand-driven signature engineering

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Mixed (normative where RFC 2119 keywords appear; quadrant classification is governed by A.6.B)
> **One-liner:** Start from the actual signature assertion, revision, relation, operation application, or Work. Add a separate ConstructorSignature only when a named receiving use needs reusable constructor vocabulary, laws, and applicability. Keep an operation description, any mathematical arrow, its application, performed Work, and publication faces distinct.

**E.24.UK settlement.** A.6.S admits no `U.SignatureEngineeringPair` kind or durable arrangement individual. The spelling is retired. `TargetSignature` and `ConstructorSignature` are use-specific designations for two independently identified `U.Signature` epistemes; neither designation adds another kind, constitution relation, or identity discriminator. Merely pairing two documents or naming both signatures establishes no relation between them.

**Use this pattern when** a project already has, or genuinely needs, a reusable signature that declares how another signature is to be authored or revised, and at least one named receiving use needs that declaration to remain stable across applications, editions, or publishers.

**Do not use this pattern** merely because one signature is edited, one direct relation is stated, one view is prepared, or one work occurrence changes a carrier. Apply that direct rule and stop. A one-off revision needs no ConstructorSignature, pair record, shared slot vocabulary, base-declaration history, arrow metadata, assignment identity, or publication package unless its own receiving claim requires one.

**First useful move.** Say what changes in ordinary language: for example, `The editor added the refund law to PaymentBoundarySignature and issued edition 4.` Identify the changed signature episteme and, when current, the operation application, System, Work, result, or edition relation. Only then ask whether a later receiver needs a reusable declaration of the constructor operations.

**What goes wrong if missed.** At one extreme, the signature, the operation description, and the Work that changes or publishes it collapse into one “contract/editing” story. At the other, every small edit acquires a second signature, a pair object, two operation lexicons, and a full attribution package.

**What this buys.** The light path stays light. Where repeatable constructor language has real users, the ConstructorSignature can preserve that language while the TargetSignature, operation description, A.6.2 arrow, application, Work, assignment, carrier, and publication view keep their own identities and direct relations.

### A.6.S:0 - PCP-TERM/LEX token guards (local-first)

This pattern reserves the following tokens in Tech (normative) register:

* **TargetSignature** — the engineered signature episteme (and its editions) under construction and stabilisation (**not** the EntityOfConcern, and **not** the target source or cell of an F.9 relation).
* **ConstructorSignature** — the enabling signature that describes constructor operations for TargetSignature evolution (do **not** mint a second Tech token such as `EnablingSignature`).

Rename-guards (common collisions):

* **enabling** — Plain adjective meaning “producing/maintaining the TargetSignature”; it is not a `U.*` token.
* **constructor** — MUST distinguish `ConstructorSignature` (episteme), a constructor-operation description, the A.6.2 arrow used to state its effect-free episteme relation, and the admitted System that applies it and performs construction Work. State any local system-role classification and obtaining assignment separately. If the physics term is intended, spell **Constructor Theory** explicitly.
* **target** — avoid bare “target” in Tech clauses; use `TargetSignature` or qualify the target (for example, “F.9 target cell” or “target holon”).
* **contract** — if source wording uses this Plain shorthand, recover whether it means `TargetSignature`, Contract Bundle, promise content, commitment, or work/evidence. In this pattern the intended recovered value is usually `TargetSignature`; promises, duties, and gates are classified under `A.6.B` and `A.6.C`.

### A.6.S:1 - Problem frame

Boundary descriptions often arrive as “half-signatures”: an n-ary relation in ordinary prose, overloaded markers such as *binding*, *anchoring*, or *contract*, and unstated assumptions about participants, applicability, and publication. Teams then revise the boundary through edits, reviews, and partial publications.

A.6.5, A.6.6, A.6.2-A.6.4, and E.17 already govern several different moves that may occur during that work. The missing discipline is not a universal engineering container. It is a proportional choice:

1. state the actual edit, relation, arrow, application, Work, edition, or view and stop when that answers the use; or
2. when a named receiver needs the same constructor vocabulary and laws again, identify a separate ConstructorSignature and state the exact dependency or use that connects it to the work.

Without that choice, two opposite failures recur:

1. the TargetSignature, constructor-operation description, application, and performed Work are conflated;
2. a one-off revision is inflated into a durable two-signature apparatus;
3. semantic changes hide behind generic edit language instead of a new episteme edition and its actual continuity or reference change; and
4. publication views acquire claims not present in the described signature.

An episteme does not act. When precise performed Work is current, recover each exact actual performer `U.System` through A.13 and let A.15.1 independently admit the dated occurrence; a System may separately apply a described operation. Add the exact A.2.1 assignment and F.6 Work-assignment relation only when a receiving claim expressly consumes precise assignment-bound attribution through the same obtaining A.13 assignment; F.6 identifies neither assignment nor performer, and the assignment itself does not act.

### A.6.S:2 - Problem

FPF needs a pattern for **engineering signatures as boundary epistemes**: a disciplined way to construct, revise, and publish a target `U.Signature` from partial input, while maintaining:

* separation between *signature* and *mechanism* (A.6.0 vs A.6.1),
* separation between *laws*, *admissibility*, *deontics*, and *work evidence* (A.6.B),
* explicit multi‑view publication without semantic drift (E.17),
* reproducible evolution across editions without silent mutation.

### A.6.S:3 - Forces

* **Stability vs evolution.** TargetSignatures must be stable enough to coordinate, yet change as understanding improves.
* **Explicitness vs overhead.** Unpacking slots/bases/views increases clarity but also increases authoring effort.
* **Arrow law vs enacted work.** An A.6.2 arrow may state the effect-free relation between source and successor signature epistemes. Applying a described constructor operation, creating the successor, and writing a carrier are separately identified operation application and Work performed by an admitted System. For performed Work, recover each exact actual performer through A.13 and let A.15.1 independently admit the occurrence. Add F.6 only when a later claim expressly consumes precise assignment-bound attribution through the same obtaining A.13 assignment; F.6 checks that exact Work-assignment link and identifies neither the assignment nor the performer. Missing or failed F.6 leaves the Work intact.

* **Multi‑view richness vs semantic coherence.** Views help stakeholders, but they risk becoming divergent “versions of truth”.
* **Local meaning vs cross-local reuse.** Signature claim content pins its effective ReferenceScheme where interpretation matters. The local kind and any source-local meaning remain separate values; an actual relation between distinct F.17 cells uses F.9 with its declared limits.
* **Contract talk vs ontology.** “Contract” language invites mixing promises, norms, and invariants; FPF requires quadrant discipline.
* **No epistemic agency.** It is tempting to phrase “the ConstructorSignature constructs…”. In FPF, only Systems act; epistemes do not.

### A.6.S:4 - Solution - start with the direct move; add a ConstructorSignature for named reuse

#### A.6.S:4.0 - Keep the signature, arrow, application, and Work separate

The smallest account names the actual object and move. A signature revision may be stated as a change in the C.2.1 claim content of one signature episteme, followed by a separately identified successor edition when its discriminator triple changes. A view, direct relation assertion, operation application, carrier write, and performed Work remain under their own patterns.

A **ConstructorSignature** is optional. When used, it is a `U.Signature` whose reusable declaration content describes a family of constructor operations: its subject and value or result range, vocabulary, laws, and applicability. It does not perform those operations and does not contain the Work that applies them.

If a constructor family also uses an A.6.2 mathematical arrow, identify that arrow separately. The arrow relates exact source and receiving epistemes. Its rule states how their claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme compare. When it reads a neighboring grounding, representation, conformance, edition, or provenance occurrence, name that occurrence and the endpoint facts compared; the arrow neither changes the occurrence nor makes it obtain. A.6.3 and A.6.4 apply only to their exact viewing or EntityOfConcern-retargeting cases.

When a System actually authors, derives, materializes, validates, stores, or publishes an episteme, identify only the objects current for the claim: the operation application and bindings when used, the admitted System, the dated Work, the resulting episteme, and any carrier or publication relation. A local system-role classification, exact A.2.1 assignment, and separate F.6 Work-assignment relation remain optional and distinct; add each only when a later inference needs that claim.

#### A.6.S:4.1 - Decide whether a second signature is needed

Start with the **TargetSignature**: the `U.Signature` being authored, stabilized, or revised. Its A.6.0 declaration content identifies its subject and value or result range and supplies the reusable vocabulary, laws, and applicability that make it a signature. It contains neither operational gates, deontic duties, evidence claims, nor construction Work merely because those topics occur nearby.

Add a **ConstructorSignature** only when a named receiver needs reusable constructor-operation vocabulary, laws, and applicability. The receiver may be a later editioning process, another authoring System, a publication process, or another repeatable use that would otherwise have to reconstruct the same operation declaration. A one-off edit, direct relation assertion, arrow, operation application, or Work occurrence does not qualify by itself.

The two signatures remain separate C.2.1 epistemes. State only the relation that is actually current:

* when one signature cannot interpret a required term or replay a law without the other, use the exact A.6.0 declaration-dependency claim;
* when a System uses a Method or MethodDescription that cites the ConstructorSignature while revising the TargetSignature, state that method/source use and any actual application or Work under its direct pattern;
* when both signatures are merely relevant to the same local question, name them without inventing a pair relation; and
* if a future use needs a durable relation occurrence between them, first supply that relation kind's participant meanings, predicate, applicability, occurrence identity, and E.24/E.24.UK settlement. A.6.S supplies none by default.

`TargetSignature` and `ConstructorSignature` are Tech designations of each signature's place in this use, not local system-role kinds. A publication may explain TargetSignature as “the signature being engineered”; it need not introduce the abbreviation *SoI*. Do not conflate the TargetSignature with its exact C.2.1 EntityOfConcern. Distinct signature editions remain distinct epistemes when their C.2.1 discriminator triples differ; any empirical-grounding, edition, continuity, dependency, source-use, or publication relation remains separately identified.

**Mint-or-reuse note.** This pattern introduces no public U-kind. It reuses `U.Signature` and the two local designations above. A ConstructorSignature is admitted by the ordinary A.6.0 membership rule, not by being named next to a TargetSignature.

#### A.6.S:4.2 - Choose the constructor vocabulary that the receiving use needs

A ConstructorSignature declares only operation families that a named receiver will reuse. It need not contain both A.6.5 slot operations and A.6.6 declaration-change labels, and it need not contain either family when another direct operation declaration is enough.

**Slot operations, when current.** Use A.6.5 when a reusable relation declaration needs stable participant positions, fillers, or references. Its vocabulary distinguishes name binding, first or later by-value filling, reference retargeting, typed substitution, resolution, and parameter passing. Keep `bind` for name binding; do not use generic *edit* to hide a reference retargeting or a referent-internal change. A one-off ordinary edit that needs no reused SlotSpec stays an ordinary edit.

**Assertion or declaration history, when current.** Use A.6.6 first to state the actual dependent, base, and direct relation. Stop when that readable assertion answers the use. If a named receiver needs the history of an optional assertion representation or reusable declaration, its local labels such as `declareBase`, `rebase`, `rescope`, `retime`, or `refreshWitnesses` may describe which represented field changed. They do not establish or change the world-side relation. Producing new evidence is separate Work; changing a witness reference is only a record edit.

**Mathematical arrows, when current.** An operation description may cite an A.6.2, A.6.3, or A.6.4 arrow only when that mathematical relation is useful to the receiver. The ConstructorSignature states the arrow family and the endpoint values or facts it reads or compares. The arrow remains effect-free; an application that produces a receiving episteme and any performed Work remain separate.

**Publication views, when current.** If a TargetSignature is published through E.17, a ConstructorSignature may declare a reusable view-producing operation. The exact source and receiving epistemes are related by the applicable A.6.3 viewing rule, and each face adds no new claim about the EntityOfConcern. Publishing a face, writing a carrier, committing a file, or issuing a release is an application and Work, not something done by either signature.

The test is practical: remove the proposed operation family. If the named receiver can still perform or assess its use without reconstructing a shared vocabulary or law, leave that family out.

#### A.6.S:4.3 - Change discipline: Viewing vs Retargeting vs editing

When more than one distinction is current, classify each move separately rather than forcing all four buckets into every revision:

1. **Viewing (A.6.3).**
   Use when you change *presentation* (views, stakeholder cards, projections) while preserving the EntityOfConcern.

2. **Direct edits and conditional declaration history.**
   State a one-off vocabulary, law, applicability, or reference change directly. Use A.6.5 only for reusable relation-participant declarations or reference operations that matter to the receiver. Use A.6.6 declaration history only after the actual base-dependence relation is stated and a named receiver needs that history.
3. **Editioning + reference retargeting (A.6.5).**
   Use when the TargetSignature meaningfully changes and downstream coordination needs a new TargetSignature edition. Do not silently mutate the existing episteme: identify the successor edition and retarget the references whose receiving use now selects it (`Retarget<...>` in the relevant Ref slots).


4. **Epistemic retargeting and structural reinterpretation (A.6.4; rarer).**
   Use only when `EntityOfConcernRef` itself changes. A.6.4 identifies the source and receiving epistemes and one exact arrow r; a separate use assertion q states the invariant, visible loss, bounded use, conditions, support, and polarity. This is distinct from an ordinary new edition of the same TargetSignature.

Rule of thumb:

* If only presentation changes, use the direct E.17/A.6.3 view account and stop; no slot/base declaration is required unless another receiving use needs it.
* If the change is “new TargetSignature edition for consumers”, require a new edition plus explicit reference retargeting.
* If the change is a different EntityOfConcern, use A.6.4 for the exact arrow r and a separate q that states the invariant, visible loss, bounded use, conditions, support, and polarity. A kind difference alone identifies neither r nor q.

**EFEM discipline.**
When a constructor operation really uses an A.6.2 arrow family, declare its endpoint comparison and `entityOfConcernChangeMode` under A.6.2. An operation description that needs no mathematical arrow introduces none.
**Editioning is orthogonal**: you MAY mint a new edition even under `preserve`, but if you do, downstream references MUST be updated explicitly via slot discipline (A.6.5).
Any actual measurement, actuation, validation run, carrier write, or other effect is an operation application and Work under its direct pattern; it is not performed by the A.6.2 arrow.

#### A.6.S:4.4 - Add publication and claim controls only when they are current

If the TargetSignature is published through E.17, identify each publication face as a view of the exact source episteme and preserve E.17's no-new-claims boundary. The publication occurrence, carrier, viewpoint use, conformance claim, and any publication Work remain separate. No MVPK package is required merely because a signature changed.

If a receiving use needs stable claim identifiers or A.6.B quadrant classification, use the applicable claim register and separate laws, operational admissibility, deontic commitments, and evidence-use claims. Do not put operational gates, duties, evidence results, or Work into the TargetSignature merely to make one authoring record complete. If no such receiving use exists, ordinary claim content and the direct patterns are enough.

#### A.6.S:4.5 - Signature-construction relation in a transformation-flow structure (informative)

If a team represents actual signature-construction Work as an E.18 `TransformationFlowStructure`, reference only the A.6.S objects and direct relations that the flow uses; do not convert them into a second graph ontology:

* Declared constructor arrows may appear at transformation-flow loci as independently defined A.6.2 values over signature epistemes. An actual operation application and any performed Work remain separately identified.
* Concrete carrier writes (commits, releases, registry writes, and carrier and source-currentness pinning) are performed-Work loci or Work occurrences identified with A.15 and A.15.1 after each exact actual performer is recovered through A.13. Use A.2 for any separate local system-role classification. Add A.2.1 and F.6 only when the receiving flow account expressly consumes the assignment under which a performer acted; missing or failed attribution leaves the carrier-write Work intact. Use A.10 for evidence and provenance, E.17 for publication, and the relevant carrier patterns for carriers. None of these values is a constructor operation.
* Validation and admission checks are gate/check loci governed by A.21, with `OperationalGate(profile)`, `GateProfile`, `GateCheckRef`, `GateDecision`, and `DecisionLogRef` named when a gate-decision relation is present.
* Any `EntityOfConcernRef` change routes to A.6.4: identify the exact arrow r and separate q, then let E.18 place them only when a transformation-flow use is current. A kind change without that basis supplies no positive claim, and any actual operation application remains separate.

This mapping is optional. A one-off revision needs neither an E.18 flow nor a ConstructorSignature. When a flow is current, use E.18 for its structure, C.29 for any graph or path representation, and A.6.S only for the TargetSignature and any independently justified ConstructorSignature and operation declarations.

#### A.6.S:4.6 - State during construction (informative)

Do not mint a new kernel “signature state” unless you need it.
In most cases, use:

* **edition** + explicit continuity/withdrawal links for semantic evolution, and
* a coarse **status** (`Draft`/`Review`/`Stable`/`Deprecated`) for process signalling.

If a project needs a reusable state-change policy, place it in the applicable signature's declared content or in a separately identified policy episteme, according to its actual EntityOfConcern and use. A one-off status change is stated directly.
Where state-change policy is normative, express it as a status or state-transition policy for the relevant signature episteme or publication under its effective scheme and ClaimScope, with A.2.4 and F.10 status-use discipline and A.6.5 slot discipline where needed. Do not call the episteme's status a system role or create a system-role assignment for it; use E.10.ROLE to route bare *role* wording to the actual status, state, declaration position, or other direct branch.

### A.6.S:5 - Worked cases

**Ordinary cheap stop.** An editor adds the law `Refund does not increase net balance` to `PaymentBoundarySignature` and issues edition 4. The changed ClaimGraph identifies a new signature episteme; the edition or continuity relation and the editor's Work are stated only when the receiving claim uses them. If nobody needs reusable constructor vocabulary, stop. No ConstructorSignature or pair object is created.

#### A.6.S:5.1 - Repeated engineering of a service boundary

**Working situation.** Several client teams and two authoring Systems will revise and republish the same payments boundary over multiple editions. They need one reusable account of the allowed authoring operations.

**TargetSignature:** `PaymentBoundarySignature` declares operations such as `Authorize`, `Charge`, and `Refund`; the participant meanings and ref modes that are actually reused; laws such as idempotent charging; and the external-API applicability boundary.

**ConstructorSignature:** `PaymentSignatureEngineering` is justified because the named authoring and review uses reuse the same operation vocabulary and laws. It may declare:

* a by-value law revision and a reference-retargeting operation under A.6.5 when those distinctions are reused;
* a direct calibration, provenance, or other relation assertion under its own pattern, with an A.6.6 declaration-change label only when a receiver tracks its represented history; and
* an E.17 view-producing operation for the repeated Plain, Tech, and interoperability publications.

`PaymentSignatureEngineeringPipeline`, if admitted as a System, may apply those descriptions and perform dated authoring or publication Work. The ConstructorSignature does not act. State a local system-role classification, exact A.2.1 assignment, separate F.6 Work-assignment relation, application binding, carrier, or evidence relation only when the receiving claim uses it.

The sentence `Charges are recorded in Ledger L for the external API` must first name and test its actual direct relation. Do not replace it with `declareBase`, a generic `baseRelation`, or a witness package. If later comparison needs a stable representation of that assertion and its scope, A.6.6 may add the optional declaration history.

The publication faces remain views of the exact TargetSignature edition. `Guarantees idempotency` is unpacked into the actual law, any separate mechanism admission condition, deontic commitment, and evidence-use claim; the word *contract* creates none of them.

#### A.6.S:5.2 - Repeated engineering of a model-correspondence signature

**Working situation.** A research group maintains a correspondence signature across several model editions and publishes mathematical and engineering views. A second group must reproduce the same revisions.

`ModelCorrespondenceSignature` is the TargetSignature. Its vocabulary, laws, and applicability state the exact correspondence claim and the schemes in which it is interpreted. An actual F.9 Bridge is cited only when a relation between two exact F.17 cells obtains and a separate bounded-use claim is current.

`CorrespondenceSignatureEngineering` is an optional ConstructorSignature because the second group reuses its declared revision and view-production vocabulary. A reference-retargeting operation may identify a new model edition. An A.6.2 arrow may compare exact source and receiving signature epistemes and any named neighboring facts; it changes none of those facts. The actual application, authoring System, Work, resulting episteme, and publications remain separate.

If the project only changes one reference dataset window once, state that direct revision and any needed Work or successor edition, then stop. Do not create the ConstructorSignature merely to host `retime`.

### A.6.S:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: signature-engineering uses that meet the entry condition; ordinary one-off revisions remain outside the two-signature branch.

* **Architecture bias (Arch):** a reusable ConstructorSignature can improve repeated work but can also turn one edit into a framework.
  *Mitigation:* require a named receiver for the reusable vocabulary and laws; otherwise use the direct move and stop.
* **Onto/Epist bias (Onto/Epist):** treating “editing the signature” as harmless can hide semantic change.
  *Mitigation:* distinguish a direct edit or new same-EntityOfConcern edition from an A.6.4 retargeting. A changed C.2.1 discriminator identifies another episteme; A.6.4 opens only when the exact EntityOfConcern changes.

* **Pragmatic bias (Prag):** repeatable operation declarations cost authoring effort.
  *Mitigation:* introduce them only when a named receiver would otherwise reconstruct the same vocabulary or law; do not tighten a nonexistent ConstructorSignature.

### A.6.S:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| **CC-A.6.S-1** | State the actual assertion, revision, relation, arrow, application, or Work first. If it answers the receiving use, no ConstructorSignature or pair object is required. | Preserves the cheap direct path. |
| **CC-A.6.S-2** | A ConstructorSignature appears only when one named receiving use needs reusable constructor vocabulary, laws, and applicability. It is an independently identified `U.Signature`; `U.SignatureEngineeringPair` is not used. | Prevents an unsupported object and needless second signature. |
| **CC-A.6.S-3** | When two signatures are both current, state the exact A.6.0 dependency, method/source use, or other direct relation that actually obtains. Co-mentioning them creates no relation. | Keeps the connection explicit without inventing a universal pair. |
| **CC-A.6.S-4** | The ConstructorSignature declares only operation families its named receiver reuses. A.6.5 slot verbs, A.6.6 declaration-change labels, A.6.2-A.6.4 arrows, E.17 views, assignment identity, and evidence are each conditional on their own current use. | Prevents the constructor menu from becoming a mandatory package. |
| **CC-A.6.S-5** | A meaning change identifies a new TargetSignature episteme when a C.2.1 discriminator changes. State edition, continuity, and reference-retargeting claims only under their actual predicates; use A.6.4 only when the exact EntityOfConcern-retargeting arrow and separate use claim are current. | Separates episteme change, editioning, reference change, and retargeting. |
| **CC-A.6.S-6** | If an A.6.2-A.6.4 arrow is declared, keep the arrow, its use assertion, operation description, application, and Work distinct. Name the endpoint values and neighboring facts read or compared; the arrow changes no neighboring relation occurrence. | Preserves the accepted arrow/application/Work boundary. |
| **CC-A.6.S-7** | If E.17 publication is used, each face remains a view of the exact source episteme and adds no new claim. The publication occurrence, carrier, viewpoint use, conformance, and Work remain separate. | Prevents publication drift. |
| **CC-A.6.S-8** | A System, not a signature, assignment, or local system-role kind, performs actual Work. Recover each exact actual performer through A.13 and let A.15.1 independently admit the Work; add the exact A.2.1 assignment and separate F.6 Work-assignment relation only when the receiving claim expressly consumes precise assignment-bound attribution. Add application, carrier, provenance, or evidence relations only when their own distinctions are needed. | Preserves agency without mandatory attribution paperwork. |
| **CC-A.6.S-9** | Laws, operational admissibility, deontic commitments, evidence use, and Work remain under their direct patterns. The TargetSignature and ConstructorSignature do not become all-purpose containers. | Preserves A.6.B and direct-relation boundaries. |
| **CC-A.6.S-10** | The account begins with an ordinary sentence naming what changed or was reused and what visible result follows. Formal vocabulary is added only where it changes a receiving inference. | Keeps the pattern usable by a cold reader. |

### A.6.S:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Why it fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pair object by juxtaposition** | Two signatures are named and called `U.SignatureEngineeringPair`. | No admitted kind, predicate, applicability, or occurrence identity exists. | Retire the pair token; state the exact dependency or use that actually obtains, or merely name both signatures. |
| **ConstructorSignature for every edit** | A one-line revision acquires two operation lexicons, arrow metadata, assignment, evidence, and publication records. | Reusable declaration work has replaced the actual task. | State the direct revision and stop; add a ConstructorSignature only for a named reuse of its vocabulary and laws. |
| **One publication mixes declaration and work record** | Target laws, constructor notes, review history, gates, and Work evidence share one undifferentiated artifact. | Signature, operation description, application, Work, and carrier cannot be distinguished. | Separate only the objects current for the receiving use; do not create a ConstructorSignature merely to hold notes. |
| **Silent semantic edit** | A law or applicability changes while consumers still cite the old episteme. | A new C.2.1 discriminator triple is presented as the same episteme. | Identify the successor episteme and the exact edition, continuity, or reference change actually used. |
| **Arrow as performed operation** | An A.6.2 arrow is said to author, validate, or publish a signature. | Mathematical relation, application, and Work collapse. | Let the arrow compare exact epistemes; identify any application, System, and Work separately. |
| **View as another truth** | Plain and Tech faces add different commitments. | Publication gained semantics. | Keep each face an E.17 view of the exact source episteme and state any new claim separately. |
| **Episteme as actor** | The ConstructorSignature builds or publishes the TargetSignature. | Hides the acting System and gives agency to a description. | Say what the signature describes; name the System and Work only when the receiving claim needs them. |

### A.6.S:9 - Consequences

**Benefits.** One-off work remains readable and cheap. Repeated engineering can still reuse a stable ConstructorSignature. Edition, view, arrow, application, Work, assignment, evidence, and carrier claims remain independently repairable.

**Costs.** A project must decide whether reusable constructor content exists instead of opening a standard package automatically. When it does exist, maintaining another signature costs attention. The mitigation is the named-receiver test and a declaration containing only the vocabulary and laws that receiver reuses.

**Adoption test (informative).** Ask three questions in order: What actual signature claim or change is current? Does that direct account answer the use? Which named receiver, if any, needs reusable constructor vocabulary and laws? A valid adoption result may contain one TargetSignature and one ordinary revision sentence, with no ConstructorSignature.

### A.6.S:10 - Rationale

Stable boundaries sometimes benefit from a reusable description of how they are revised. That is the useful two-signature technique: one `U.Signature` is the current target declaration, and another `U.Signature` declares constructor operations for a named reuse. It is not a universal architecture for editing and does not require a third pair object.

A.6.5, A.6.6, A.6.2-A.6.4, and E.17 supply distinct optional moves. Treating all of them as mandatory constructor primitives would recreate the ambiguity and overhead those patterns are meant to remove. The direct move comes first; the reusable ConstructorSignature packages only the operation language that has an actual receiver.

The result keeps viewing, declaration edits, episteme succession, reference retargeting, EntityOfConcern retargeting, application, and Work distinct. A.6.B likewise keeps laws, gates, duties, and evidence-use claims from competing in one “contract” paragraph.

**SoTA source note (informative).** Modern effect systems support the separation between an operation declaration and effectful realization; categorical optics inform explicit preservation claims; and architecture-description practice informs accountable views. A.6.S adopts those limited separations without importing a tool ontology or making a ConstructorSignature mandatory.

### A.6.S:11 - SoTA-Echoing

* **Adopt: algebraic effects and effect systems separate operation signatures from handler semantics.**
  Contemporary effect systems emphasise that an operation signature can be described independently of how effects are handled. A.6.S adopts that separation here: the TargetSignature remains the boundary declaration, while any operation application, construction Work, and operational enforcement remain separately identified. This echoes row-typed algebraic effects and modern handler formulations (Leijen 2017; Hillerström & Lindley 2018).

* **Adapt: categorical optics treat “focus” and “round‑trip laws” as a disciplined interface for bidirectional structure.**
  Optics offer a compact mathematical language for “what is preserved” under a transformation and when updates are coherent. A.6.S adapts this mindset to boundary evolution: viewing corresponds to projection, and retargeting corresponds to an explicit transition with stated preservation claims. Profunctor optics provide a post‑2015 reference point for this style of interface reasoning (Pickering, Gibbons & Wu 2017).

* **Adapt: architecture description standards formalise `U.Viewpoint` and `U.View` responsibility and reduce semantic drift across representations.**
  ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 treats views as products of viewpoints, with explicit stakeholder concerns and responsibility. A.6.S uses only the view-accountability lesson: when MVPK publication is current, each face is an explicit view of the exact source episteme. A ConstructorSignature is added only when a named receiver reuses the view-producing operation declaration; it is not required to explain how every view was produced.

* **Adopt in spirit: behavioural protocol disciplines treat boundaries as typed interaction protocols with safety commitments.**
  Session and behavioural type practice treats boundaries as protocols with progress and safety properties, which matches the A.6 split between signature laws and mechanism entry gates. A.6.S does not import tooling or typechecking, but it adopts the practice of making boundary interactions explicit and law‑governed (e.g., modern MPST practice as cited in A.6.1).

### A.6.S:12 - Relations

* **Depends on:**

  * A.3.1/A.3.2/A.15/A.15.1/A.15.2 — Method, MethodDescription, WorkPlan, Work, and work-result separation
  * A.7 — Strict Distinction (object ≠ description ≠ carrier; Face ≠ Surface)
  * A.6 — Signature Stack & Boundary Discipline
  * A.6.0 — `U.Signature`
  * A.6.2 — effect-free episteme-arrow discipline, only when a constructor operation uses a mathematical arrow; endpoint facts are read or compared, not changed by the arrow
  * A.13 and A.15.1 — exact actual-performer recovery and independent dated-Work admission; A.2 and A.2.1/F.6 enter separately only when the receiving use consumes local-kind classification or precise assignment-bound attribution
  * C.2.1 — episteme identity through claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme, with empirical grounding and edition continuity kept as separate direct relations
  * (optional) E.18 — TransformationFlowStructure, when signature-construction work is represented as a transformation-flow structure
  * E.10 and LEX discipline — if the publication uses Plain twins (“SoI”) or shorthands, keep their exact Tech readings recoverable and keep Plain twins out of normative register
  * A.6.3 — `U.EpistemicViewing`
  * A.6.4 — EntityOfConcern-retargeting arrows and their separate use claims
  * A.6.5 — relation-declaration slot discipline
  * A.6.6 — Base Declaration Discipline
  * A.6.B — Boundary Norm Square & Claim Register discipline
  * E.17 and E.17.0 — MVPK and multi‑view describing

* **Coordinates with:** A.6.5 for reused relation-participant or reference operations and A.6.6 for direct base-dependence assertions and optional declaration history; neither vocabulary is mandatory.

* **Constrains:** a signature-engineering use only where the relevant meaning change, edition, reference retargeting, view, application, or Work claim is current; one distinction does not make the others mandatory.

#### A.6.S:12.1 - Integration pointers (informative)

Grounding pointers in the current FPF draft (for alignment while integrating):

* Canonical pattern template order and section requirements (E.8).
* SoTA‑Echoing requirements and avoidance of data governance/tool binding (E.8:11, E.8:8).
* A.6.5 slot operations and A.6.6 declaration-change labels are optional vocabulary sources for a ConstructorSignature only when a named receiver reuses them.
* A.6.2 effect-free arrow boundary: the arrow relates epistemes; the operation description, application, and Work remain separate.
* A.3.1/A.3.2/A.15/A.15.1/A.15.2 method, method-description, work-plan, and work separation for “constructor described vs enacted”.
* A.7 strict distinction and Face/Surface separation (no object–description–carrier soup).
* A.1 System admission, A.13 exact actual-performer recovery, and A.15 Work discipline establish the actor and independently admitted Work. A.2 local system-role classification and A.2.1/F.6 assignment-bound attribution enter only when those separate claims are current. An episteme, local kind, or assignment does not act.
* Slot operation lexicon and naming guidance (A.6.5).
* A.6.6 direct-first base-dependence discipline and its optional declaration-history labels.
* MVPK faces as fixed view kinds with “no new semantics” intent (E.17).
* Claim register and quadrant separation discipline (A.6.B).
