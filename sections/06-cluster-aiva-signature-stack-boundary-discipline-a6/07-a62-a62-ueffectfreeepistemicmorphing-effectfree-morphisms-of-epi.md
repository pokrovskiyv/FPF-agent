## A.6.2 - `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` — Effect‑free morphisms of epistemes
> **Status:** Stable
> **Type:** Definitional ontic pattern

**One‑line summary.** `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (EFEM) is the universal class of **effect-free, law-constrained morphisms between epistemes**. An EFEM morphism rewrites episteme components (ClaimGraph, `entityOfConcernRef`, optional `groundingHolonRef`, `viewpointRef`, `referenceScheme`, and—where C.2.1+ is in use—`representationSchemeRef` and related slots, plus meta) in a **conservative, functorial, reproducible** way, with an explicit mode for what happens to the **EntityOfConcernSlot** (`EntityOfConcernChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}`) as defined by `C.2.1 U.EpistemeSlotRelation`.

**Use this pattern when** a project needs to transform an episteme into another episteme while preserving the distinction between episteme-only change, EntityOfConcern retargeting, publication rendering, mechanism application, and performed work.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A view, retargeting, refinement, representation change, publication rendering, mechanism application, or work occurrence is treated as the same operation, so the project can no longer tell whether the EntityOfConcern changed or only the episteme changed.

**What this buys.** EFEM gives one law-constrained episteme-to-episteme morphism discipline with explicit preserve/retarget mode, slot/ref boundaries, conservativity, and composition conditions.

**Placement.** After **A.6.1 `U.Mechanism`** and before any specialisations (`A.6.3 U.EpistemicViewing`, `A.6.4 U.EpistemicRetargeting`).

**Builds on.**
A.6.0 `U.Signature` (subject/vocabulary/laws/applicability); A.6.1 `U.Mechanism`; A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`; C.2.1 `U.Episteme — Epistemes and their slot relation`; E.10.D2 (EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary and specification use/refinement gates); C.3.* (Kind‑CAL / KindBridge for EntityOfConcern classes).

**Used by.**
A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing`; A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting`; E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`; E.17 (MVPK); E.18 (structural reinterpretation over transformation-flow structure).

**EntityOfConcern change-mode discipline.** EFEM uses `EntityOfConcernChangeMode` for the preserve/retarget characteristic over C.2.1's EntityOfConcernSlot / entityOfConcernRef family. Earlier source-side spellings must be normalized to the EntityOfConcern family before conformant use and do not define a second EntityOfConcern ontology.

**Body-level U-kind settlement.** `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` is the governed durable value in this pattern. `U.Episteme` is reused from C.2.1; episteme species such as episteme card, view, and publication are dependent episteme or publication values only when C.2.1/E.17 governs them. `ClaimGraph`, `ReferenceScheme`, `Viewpoint`, and related names are ValueKinds or SlotKinds inside the C.2.1 episteme slot relation and A.6.5 SlotSpec discipline. `SubjectRef` is source wiring that decodes through `DescriptionContext`; it is not a second EntityOfConcern ontology. `EpMorphism` below is the local mathematical-lens arrow value for the episteme category, not a root U-kind. Claims about performed work, mechanism application, or presentation carriers leave EFEM and use A.15, A.6.1, E.17, or the direct publication pattern.

### A.6.2:1 - Problem frame

FPF has many operations that **transform knowledge epistemes or publications** without directly doing work in the world:

* turning an informal method description into a more formal specification;
* projecting a large system description into a smaller “for‑safety‑officer” view;
* re‑expressing the same behavioural model in a different calculus or notation;
* retargeting an analysis from “this subsystem” to “that subsystem” along a known KindBridge.

All of these are **episteme→episteme** transforms: they change what is written in an episteme, but they **do not themselves measure, execute, or actuate**. They are neither Work (A.15) nor Mechanisms in the A.6.1 sense; they are “pure morphisms over epistemes”.

Without a universal pattern for such morphisms:

* every family (KD‑CAL, E.18, MVPK, discipline packs) reinvent their own notion of “projection”, “reinterpretation”, or “refinement”;
* laws about what may change in an episteme (content vs EntityOfConcern vs grounding holon vs reference plane) fragment across the spec;
* cross‑family reasoning (e.g. “this E.18 structural reinterpretation is a retargeting, not a view”) becomes brittle and ad‑hoc.

### A.6.2:2 - Problem

Concretely, without EFEM:

1. **No single place for “effect‑free” discipline.**
   The distinction *“episteme‑only change”* vs *“Work in the world”* is already important (C.2.1 separates episteme components from Work and from publication forms, renderings, and carriers), but the laws for “episteme‑only” operations are scattered or implicit.

2. **EntityOfConcern behaviour is unclear.**
   Many transforms **intend** to keep “what this episteme is about” fixed (viewing), others **intend** to change it under an invariant (retargeting). Without a common *EntityOfConcernChangeMode* discipline we get silent breaks in “entityOfConcern”: an operation that looks like a harmless format change may in fact surreptitiously change the entity of concern.

3. **No functorial backbone.**
   MVPK, KD‑CAL, and E.18 all implicitly assume that episteme transforms **compose** and respect identities, but the conditions for this (purity, conservativity, idempotence, scope) are not formulated once and reused. Different parts of the spec repeat subtly different sets of laws.

4. **Slot/Ref confusion.**
   With the new `U.EpistemeSlotRelation` and `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`, every episteme now has explicit **SlotKind / ValueKind / RefKind** discipline. Laws for “projection” or “retargeting” that are written against “fields” or unnamed tuple components are now out of alignment.

The result: engineers and tool builders can no longer tell **when they are allowed to transform epistemes without changing what is being claimed about the world**, nor what needs to be witnessed by Bridges and CL‑penalties when entityOfConcern does change.

### A.6.2:3 - Forces

* **Epistemic purity vs operational power.**
  Effect‑free episteme transforms are attractive precisely because they can be reasoned about algebraically and composed freely. But the more operational power they are given (IO, solver calls, measurements), the less they remain “pure” and the more they belong under `U.Mechanism` or performed `U.Work` governed by A.15.

* **Preserve vs retarget.**
  Viewing is entityOfConcern‑preserving; reinterpretation along a KindBridge is entityOfConcern-retargeting. Both are important, but **they must be distinguished and witnessed differently**.

* **Conservativity vs usefulness.**
  EFEM should be **conservative**: no new commitments about the EntityOfConcern beyond what input epistemes already entail. At the same time, transformations may *factor*, *aggregate*, or *normalise* content, which may drop information or change representation when the loss and interpretation rule are explicit.

* **Locality vs reference planes and Bridges.**
  Epistemes live on **reference planes** (C.2.1); cross‑plane and cross‑Context reasoning goes via Bridges and CL penalties (Part F/B.3). EFEM must respect this: it cannot smuggle plane changes or transport into “pure” content rewrites.

* **EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary and specification-use refinement.**
  The EntityOfConcern is not identical to the Description episteme produced by this use; it may itself be `U.Episteme` when an episteme is under concern. `...Description` names a Description episteme, and `...Spec` names a Description episteme admitted for specification use when its `subjectRef` decodes to `DescriptionContext = ⟨EntityOfConcernRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` and the declared checkability/formality/harness gate is present. EFEM admits operations on those epistemes and their slot/ref discipline while keeping EntityOfConcern, Description episteme, Description episteme admitted for specification use, publication face, publication form, publication unit, publication carrier, and rendering lanes distinct (A.7, E.10.D2).

### A.6.2:4 - Solution — define `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` once

#### A.6.2:4.1 - Informal definition

> **Definition.** A `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (EFEM) is a class of **episteme→episteme morphisms** that:
>
> * operate **only** on the components of an episteme as fixed in `C.2.1 U.EpistemeSlotRelation` (`ClaimGraphSlot`, `EntityOfConcernSlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, representation/reference schemes, and meta);
> * are **effect‑free** (no Work, no Mechanism application, no mutation of systems or carriers);
> * are **conservative** in what they claim about the EntityOfConcern: no new EntityOfConcern commitment may appear unless it is a logical consequence under the declared ReferenceScheme, correspondence, or bridge invariant;
> * are **functorial** (identities and composition behave as expected on the category of epistemes);
> * declare an explicit **EntityOfConcernChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}**, controlling how `EntityOfConcernSlot` behaves, and how source `subjectRef` decodes through `DescriptionContext` when that wiring name is present.

The category-theory **objects** of the EFEM universe are epistemes of some `U.EpistemeKind` (typically realised as `U.EpistemeCard` / `U.EpistemeView` / `U.EpistemePublication`). The **arrows** are EFEM morphisms `f : X → Y` satisfying the P0–P5 laws below.

Specialisations:

* `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3) — EFEM with `EntityOfConcernChangeMode = preserve`.
* `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (A.6.4) — EFEM with `EntityOfConcernChangeMode = retarget`, tied to KindBridges/ReferencePlanes.

#### A.6.2:4.2 - Signature Block (A.6.0 alignment)

As a `U.Signature`, EFEM publishes the following **SubjectBlock** and the standard four‑row block (“SubjectBlock / Vocabulary / Laws / Applicability”) from A.6.0, specialised to episteme→episteme morphisms.

**SubjectBlock**

```
SubjectBlock
  SubjectKind   = U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing
  RangedValueKind = ⟨X : U.Episteme, Y : U.Episteme⟩        // episteme pair (domain,codomain)
  Quantification= SliceSet:=ContextSliceSet;
  ExtentRule:=admissibleEpistemeMorphisms // Context slices & admissible EFEM per slice
  ResultKind?   = EpMorphism                               // local typed arrow f : X->Y in the Ep category
```

This says: EFEM is “about” **morphisms between epistemes**, indexed by Context slices; its results are local `EpMorphism` arrow values in the `Ep` category.

**Vocabulary (core operators & kinds)**

* **Types**
  * `U.Episteme` (as holon; realised via species `U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemeView`, `U.EpistemePublication` under C.2.1).
  * `U.EpistemeKind` (episteme n‑ary relation signature; slots per A.6.5 / C.2.1).
  * `SubjectRef` (source wiring name only; for Description epistemes, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use, it decodes to `DescriptionContext = ⟨EntityOfConcernRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` per C.2.1 §6.1 / E.10.D2). It does not define another EntityOfConcern family.
  * `EpMorphism` (local arrow value in `Ep`, governed by this morphism pattern and C.29 when the mathematical lens is current).
  * `U.EntityOfConcernChangeMode = {preserve, retarget}` (enumeration; no new durable U-kind named “EntityOfConcern”).

* **Operators (arrow algebra)**

  * `id_X : EpMorphism(X->X)` for any episteme `X`.
  * `compose(g,f) : EpMorphism(X->Z)` where `f : X->Y`, `g : Y->Z`.
  * `apply(f, x:U.Episteme) : U.Episteme`.
  * `dom(f), cod(f) : U.Episteme`.
  * `subjectRef(E) : SubjectRef` as source projection from `DescriptionContext`, when source wiring exposes that name.
  * `entityOfConcernChangeMode(f) : U.EntityOfConcernChangeMode`  // EFEM‑level characteristic from C.2.1.

Each operator that takes epistemes as arguments obeys **SlotSpec discipline** from A.6.5: in particular, laws below are phrased in terms of the **named SlotKinds** (`EntityOfConcernSlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`, `ViewSlot`, and—when the C.2.1+ extension is used—`RepresentationSchemeSlot`) and their associated ValueKind/RefKind; we never speak of “field 1/2/3”.

**Laws row** and **Applicability** are given by P0–P5 and the Scope clause below.

#### A.6.2:4.3 - Laws P0–P5 (normative)

All laws below are **admissibility predicates**: a morphism advertised as an instance of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` satisfies them.

##### A.6.2:4.3.1 - P0 — Typed signature & component profile (C.2.1‑grounded)

For any EFEM morphism `f : X→Y`:

1. **Typed epistemes.** `X` and `Y` are epistemes of declared kinds `K_X, K_Y : U.EpistemeKind`, each with a SlotKind signature as per C.2.1 and A.6.5 (at least `EntityOfConcernSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot?`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot?`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot?`; `GroundingHolonSlot?`, `ViewSlot?` where relevant).

2. **Component projection.** For each episteme `E`, EFEM laws may refer to:
   * `content(E) : U.ClaimGraph` — value of `ClaimGraphSlot` (stored **by value** in the minimal core);
   * `entityOfConcernRef(E) : U.EntityRef` — value of the RefKind for `EntityOfConcernSlot`;
   * `groundingHolonRef?(E) : U.HolonRef` — if the episteme kind includes `GroundingHolonSlot`;
   * `viewpointRef?(E) : U.ViewpointRef` — if `ViewpointSlot` is present;
   * `referenceScheme?(E) : U.ReferenceScheme` — value of `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (stored **by value** in the minimal core);
   * `representationSchemeRef?(E) : U.RepresentationSchemeRef` — only for episteme kinds that use the C.2.1+ `RepresentationSchemeSlot`;
   * `meta(E)` — edition/provenance/status components (species‑level).

3. **Declared `EntityOfConcernChangeMode`.**
   Each EFEM species **declares** a fixed `EntityOfConcernChangeMode ∈ {preserve, retarget}`. At the level of individual morphisms:

   * if `entityOfConcernChangeMode(f) = preserve`, then `entityOfConcernRef(Y) = entityOfConcernRef(X)` (and usually `groundingHolonRef(Y) = groundingHolonRef(X)` unless an explicit Grounding Bridge is declared);
   * if `entityOfConcernChangeMode(f) = retarget`, then `entityOfConcernRef(Y) ≠ entityOfConcernRef(X)` in general and the record names a **KindBridge** between the two EntityOfConcern values (A.6.4 / F.9).

4. **SubjectRef source discipline.**
   For Description epistemes, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use (`…Description` / `…Spec`), `subjectRef(E)` is a `DescriptionContext = ⟨EntityOfConcernRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` (E.10.D2). EFEM species state how source `subjectRef` transforms in terms of these components (usually: preserve or explicitly adjust `ViewpointRef` while preserving `EntityOfConcernRef` and `BoundedContextRef`).

##### A.6.2:4.4.2 - P1 — Purity (no external effects)

EFEM morphisms are **pure functions on epistemes**:
* Applying `f : X→Y` **does not**:
  * change any `U.System` or `U.Holon` state;
  * perform `U.Work` or run a `U.Mechanism` (A.6.1) with operational guards;
  * create, update, or mutate a presentation carrier, publication carrier, file, database, message bus, or IDE artifact.
* The **only** state change introduced by EFEM is the replacement of input epistemes by output epistemes according to `apply(f, X) = Y`, with all component changes governed by P2–P5.

Any operation that requires **measurements, simulations, solver calls, or tool use with external side-effects** is modelled as a `U.Mechanism`/`U.Work` that **produces new epistemes**, which may then be related by EFEM morphisms.

##### A.6.2:4.3.3 - P2 — Conservativity (no new EntityOfConcern commitments)

Let `content_X = content(X)`, `content_Y = content(Y)`, with associated `referenceScheme_X`, `referenceScheme_Y`, `entityOfConcernRef_X`, `entityOfConcernRef_Y`, `groundingHolonRef_X`, `groundingHolonRef_Y`. Interpret each `content` via its `ReferenceScheme` and slots. Then:

> The set of **claims about the EntityOfConcern values** that can be interpreted from `Y` **introduces no new atomic commitments** beyond those that are logical consequences of the claims interpreted from `X`, possibly after applying a declared correspondence between representation/reference schemes.

Intuitively:

* EFEM may:
  * delete information (projection/abstraction);
  * normalise or re‑express information (e.g., reordering ClaimGraph, changing notation via a ReferenceScheme/RepresentationScheme correspondence);
  * add **meta‑claims about the episteme** itself (edition, source, status, witness entries).

* EFEM may **not**:
  * assert new atomic facts about the EntityOfConcern values or grounding holons beyond what is derivable from input ClaimGraphs under the declared ReferenceSchemes;
  * silently widen the scope of claims (e.g., treating local facts as global, changing Context or ReferencePlane without a Bridge).

Where `entityOfConcernChangeMode(f) = retarget`, conservativity is understood **relative to a declared invariant** of the KindBridge (A.6.4): e.g., conservation of energy for a Fourier transform, or preservation of functional behaviour for a structural reinterpretation.

##### A.6.2:4.3.4 - P3 — Functoriality (identity, composition, correspondence)

We work in the category **Ep** whose objects are epistemes (species of `U.Episteme`) and whose arrows are EFEM morphisms satisfying P0–P2, together with the functor

```
α : Ep → Ref
```

that maps each episteme to its EntityOfConcern reference (value of `EntityOfConcernSlot`, i.e. `entityOfConcernRef(E)`) as in the mathematical description used for epistemes. EFEM instances with `entityOfConcernChangeMode(f) = preserve` are **vertical morphisms** for α (`α(f) = id`), while those with `entityOfConcernChangeMode(f) = retarget` reindex along a declared `KindBridge` in **Ref**.

1. **Identities.** For each episteme `X`, there exists `id_X : X→X` such that:

   ```text
   apply(id_X, X) = X
   compose(id_Y, f) = f = compose(f, id_X)
   ```

   `id_X` preserves all components (`content`, `entityOfConcernRef`, `groundingHolonRef`, `viewpointRef`, `representationSchemeRef`, `referenceScheme`, `meta`).

2. **Composition.** For `f : X→Y`, `g : Y→Z`, the composite `h = compose(g,f)` is an EFEM morphism `X→Z` with:

   ```
   apply(h, X) = apply(g, apply(f, X))
   entityOfConcernChangeMode(h) = combine(entityOfConcernChangeMode(f), entityOfConcernChangeMode(g))   // as per species-specific rules
   ```

and P0–P2 hold for `h`. For example, two `preserve` morphisms compose to `preserve`; `preserve` after `retarget` is `retarget` if the KindBridge composition exists.

3. **Correspondence‑aware composition.**
   When EFEM changes `RepresentationScheme` or `ReferenceScheme`, a **CorrespondenceModel** (as in C.2.1 §6 and E.17) may be needed to witness commutativity: composition respects these correspondences up to declared isomorphism/oplax naturality (witness epistemes may be recorded in `meta`).

##### A.6.2:4.3.5 - P4 — Idempotence & determinism (on fixed configuration)

For any EFEM morphism `f : X→Y` with fixed configuration (episteme kinds, `EntityOfConcernChangeMode` characteristic, KindBridge/CorrespondenceModel where needed):

1. **Determinism.**
   For the same input episteme `X` (identical content, slots, meta), `apply(f, X)` yields the same output episteme `Y` up to declared structural equivalence (normal forms, alpha‑renaming etc.). There is no dependence on ambient time, randomness, network state, or solver heuristics unless these are **encoded as explicit inputs**.

2. **Idempotence (up to declared equivalence).**
   Re‑applying the same EFEM to its own output yields no further essential change:

   ```text
   apply(f, apply(f, X)) ≅ apply(f, X)
   ```

   where `≅` denotes the structural equivalence declared for the episteme kinds in question (e.g., ClaimGraph normalisation).

Species MAY weaken idempotence to “idempotent after normalisation”; if so, the normalisation step is itself specified as an EFEM morphism and the composite be idempotent.

##### A.6.2:4.3.6 - P5 — Applicability, scope & compatibility

Each EFEM species **publishes** an Applicability clause:

* **EntityOfConcernClass / EntityOfConcern class.**
  A constraint on the allowed ValueKind of `EntityOfConcernSlot` (via `EntityOfConcernClass ⊑ U.Entity`): e.g., “epistemes describing `U.Holon` that are systems of type X”.

* **Grounding holon & Context.**
  Constraints on `GroundingHolonSlot` and `U.BoundedContext`: where the morphism is valid (lab, runtime environment, organisational context).

* **Representation/ReferenceSchemes.**
  Enumerates admissible `RepresentationScheme`/`ReferenceScheme` pairs and any required CorrespondenceModels.

* **Viewpoint discipline.**
  For Description epistemes, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use, EFEM specifies which `U.Viewpoint`s (E.17.0) are admissible and how it interacts with `U.MultiViewDescribing` families (e.g., “works only on engineering viewpoints from TEVB” or “viewpoint‑agnostic normalisation”).

Applying EFEM **outside** its Applicability (e.g., wrong EntityOfConcernClass, missing grounding holon, incompatible Viewpoint) is **non‑conformant**: a conformant implementation rejects such attempts or models them as different mechanisms/works, not as EFEM.

Cross‑Context or cross‑plane use (changing `U.BoundedContext` or `ReferencePlane`) is **not part of EFEM**; it is handled by Bridges (Part F) and A.6.1 transport, which then feed new epistemes into EFEM.

### A.6.2:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

The examples below show how EFEM is intended to be used across the EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary, specification-use refinements, and Viewpoint/MVPK publication lanes.

#### A.6.2:5.1 - Typed specification-use refinement `Specify_DescEp_SpecDesc` (species of EFEM)

*Context.* You have an informal `U.MethodDescription` for a safety check and want a more formal `U.MethodSpec` with test harness obligations, but **about the same method**.

*Shape.*

* Domain: `X = U.MethodDescription` episteme with
  `entityOfConcernRef(X) : U.MethodRef`, `content(X) : U.ClaimGraph_D`, `viewpointRef(X)` an engineering viewpoint (TEVB), `ReferenceScheme_D`.
* Codomain: `Y = U.MethodSpec` episteme with the **same** `entityOfConcernRef(Y) = entityOfConcernRef(X)`, `viewpointRef(Y) = viewpointRef(X)`, more structured `content(Y) : U.ClaimGraph_S`, more explicit ReferenceScheme (explicit pre/post, obligations).

`Specify_DescEp_SpecDesc` is a species of EFEM:

* `entityOfConcernChangeMode(Specify_DescEp_SpecDesc) = preserve`.
* P1 — effect‑free: it transforms epistemes only.
* P2 — conservative: any behavioural claims in the Spec must be logically entailed by the informal Description and the method that fills `EntityOfConcernSlot`; if the spec makes behavioural claims not entailed by that pair, that is modelled as creating a **new EntityOfConcern claim with its own Description epistemes and specification use/refinement gates**, not as a valid EFEM instance.
* P3–P5 — functorial and scoped: specs compose, applicability bound to the appropriate engineering context and Viewpoints.

This matches A.7 and E.10.D2: EntityOfConcern-to-Description (`Describe_EoC_DescEp`) is the strict-boundary describing step and is not itself an episteme→episteme morphism; `Specify_DescEp_SpecDesc` is an optional EFEM species over a Description episteme after a specification use/refinement gate is present. EFEM supplies the episteme→episteme laws for that refinement; it does not make Specification a third peer in A.7.

#### A.6.2:5.2 - Internal normalisation of a View (species of EFEM, `entityOfConcernChangeMode = preserve`)

*Context.* In MVPK you compute a engineering view `V` of a system description; you then normalise the view (sort, factor, put equations into normal form) without changing what it says.

Let `X = V_raw`, `Y = V_norm`, both `U.EpistemeView` instances with the same:

* `entityOfConcernRef(X) = entityOfConcernRef(Y)` (same system);
* `groundingHolonRef(X) = groundingHolonRef(Y)` (same environment);
* `viewpointRef(X) = viewpointRef(Y)` (same Viewpoint);
* `representationSchemeRef(X) = representationSchemeRef(Y)` (same notation).

The EFEM `NormalizeView : X→Y`:

* has `entityOfConcernChangeMode(NormalizeView) = preserve`;
* changes only `content` and maybe `meta` (e.g. “normalised at edition E”);
* is idempotent and deterministic (P4);
* is conservative (P2): no new claims, only re‑expression.

MVPK can then **assume** functoriality of such normalisations without re‑stating the EFEM laws.

#### A.6.2:5.3 - Retargeting sketch (bridge‑backed, `entityOfConcernChangeMode = retarget`)

*Context.* E.18 structural reinterpretation maps a physical layout view into a functional behaviour view, changing the EntityOfConcern from “physical module assembly” to “functional graph” along a KindBridge.

Inside EFEM, this becomes a species with `entityOfConcernChangeMode = retarget`:
* input episteme describes `S₁` (e.g. a component hierarchy holon);
* output episteme describes `S₂` (e.g. a functional network holon);
* a declared `KindBridge(S₁,S₂)` and invariant (e.g. behavioural equivalence) provide the semantic glue;
* P2 conservativity is checked **w.r.t. that invariant**.

The details belong to A.6.4 and E.18; EFEM provides the generic discipline.

#### A.6.2:5.4 - Worked SlotSpec example (engineering SystemDescription episteme kind)
*(informative)*

To make the SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline and EFEM laws concrete, consider a simple engineering `U.EpistemeKind` for system descriptions over `EntityOfConcernClass ⊑ U.Entity` with `EntityOfConcernClass = U.System` in a given Context. A minimal SlotSpec table for such a kind could be:

| SlotKind              | ValueKind                                     | RefKind / refMode   | Notes                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EntityOfConcernSlot` | `U.Entity` (constrained by `EntityOfConcernClass = U.System`) | `U.EntityRef`    | identifies the system that fills `EntityOfConcernSlot`                          |
| `GroundingHolonSlot`  | `U.Holon`                                     | `U.HolonRef`        | plant / runtime SoS grounding measurements and validation             |
| `ClaimGraphSlot`      | `U.ClaimGraph`                                | ByValue             | KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL ClaimGraph for the description or spec                 |
| `ViewpointSlot`       | `U.Viewpoint`                                 | `U.ViewpointRef`    | engineering viewpoint (e.g. from TEVB) under which Description epistemes, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use, are validated |
| `ReferenceSchemeSlot` | `U.ReferenceScheme`                           | ByValue             | how the ClaimGraph is interpreted against EntityOfConcern and grounding     |

This table is an instance of A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`: each row is a SlotSpec triple ⟨SlotKind, ValueKind, refMode/RefKind⟩; no additional U-kinds are introduced, and C.2.1’s constraints on `EntityOfConcernSlot`/`GroundingHolonSlot` are preserved.

Two typical EFEM species over this kind are:
* `Specify_DescEp_SpecDesc_Sys : SystemDescription → SystemSpec` — a `EntityOfConcernChangeMode = preserve` species that:
  * **reads** `EntityOfConcernSlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot` and **writes** a refined `ClaimGraphSlot` and possibly a strengthened `ReferenceSchemeSlot`;
  * satisfies P2 by only adding claims that are logical consequences of the original description plus the fixed `EntityOfConcern` (A.7 and E.10.D2);
  * satisfies CC‑C.2.1‑5 by explicitly declaring its slot profile and change mode.

* `Normalize_EngView : EpistemeView → EpistemeView` — a view‑normalisation EFEM (again with `EntityOfConcernChangeMode = preserve`) that:
  * **reads** all slots and **writes** only `ClaimGraphSlot` (normal form) and `meta`;
  * is idempotent and deterministic (P4) and pure (P1);
  * is conservative (P2) by construction: it never introduces new atoms about the selected system.

Concrete A.6.3/A.6.4/E.17.\* patterns for specific engineering description and specification-use idioms provide SlotSpecs of this general shape and state explicitly, per CC‑C.2.1‑5 / CC‑EFEM.\*, which slots their EFEM species read and write.

### A.6.2:6 - Bias-Annotation

* **Episteme‑first, world‑second.** EFEM is strictly about **epistemes as objects**; any world contact (measurements, executions) lives in `U.Mechanism`/`U.Work` and produces new epistemes that EFEM may subsequently relate.

* **SlotKinds, not “fields”.** Laws talk about `EntityOfConcernSlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, etc., and their ValueKind/RefKind, as per A.6.5 and C.2.1; they never use unnamed tuple positions or “unnamed slot positions”. This keeps EFEM aligned with the slot discipline used for methods, roles, services, and other n‑ary relations.

* **Local‑first semantics.** EFEM is **Context‑local**; crossings of Context or ReferencePlane are always delegated to Bridges / A.6.1 transport (with CL penalties to `R/R_eff` only). No “implicit cross‑Context EFEM” is permitted.

* **EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary and specification-use/refinement respect.** EFEM never collapses EntityOfConcern with Description epistemes or with specification-use refinements: EntityOfConcern-to-Description and optional specification-use refinement operations are typed explicitly. The former remains the A.7 describing boundary; the latter is an EFEM species only when it is an episteme→episteme refinement admitted by an exact specification use/refinement gate.

### A.6.2:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID                                                  | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑EFEM.1 (Typed episteme objects).**             | Every morphism advertised as `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` SHALL have domain and codomain epistemes whose kinds (`U.EpistemeKind`) publish SlotKinds/ValueKinds/RefKinds according to C.2.1 and A.6.5 (at least `EntityOfConcernSlot` and `ClaimGraphSlot`; other slots as declared).                                                                                                               |
| **CC‑EFEM.2 (Declared EntityOfConcernChangeMode).** | Each EFEM **species** SHALL declare the `EntityOfConcernChangeMode` characteristic `entityOfConcernChangeMode : EpMorphism -> {preserve, retarget}` as per C.2.1. For every instance `f`, `entityOfConcernChangeMode(f)` MUST be either `preserve` (=> `entityOfConcernRef` unchanged) or `retarget` (=> a KindBridge and invariant are explicitly named; see A.6.4 / F.9).                                                                                         |
| **CC‑EFEM.3 (Purity).**                             | EFEM morphisms SHALL be effect‑free: they MUST NOT directly perform Work or run mechanisms with operational guards; they only read input epistemes and construct output epistemes consistent with P2–P5. Any use of external solvers/measurements MUST be modelled as separate Mechanisms/Work that feed new epistemes into EFEM.                                                                     |
| **CC‑EFEM.4 (Conservativity).**                     | Laws for EFEM species SHALL state their conservativity regime: claims in the output MUST be logical consequences of input claims under declared ReferenceSchemes and any CorrespondenceModels/KindBridges. If an operation may strengthen claims (e.g. add commitments not entailed by inputs), it is **not** EFEM and MUST be modelled separately.                                                   |
| **CC‑EFEM.5 (Functoriality & idempotence).**        | EFEM species SHALL satisfy identity and composition with the usual category laws, and SHALL specify any structural equivalence under which idempotence holds. Non‑deterministic or order‑sensitive behaviour (beyond declared structural equivalences) is non‑conformant.                                                                                                                             |
| **CC‑EFEM.6 (Applicability & scope).**              | Each EFEM species SHALL publish Applicability in terms of: allowed `EntityOfConcernClass` constraints (ValueKind for `EntityOfConcernSlot`), Context/BoundedContext and grounding holon constraints, admissible Viewpoints and representation/reference schemes. Applying EFEM outside this Applicability (including cross‑Context or cross‑plane) is non‑conformant. Crossings MUST be delegated to Bridges/A.6.1 transport. |
| **CC‑EFEM.7 (EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary, specification use/refinement, and `subjectRef` discipline).**      | For any episteme that is a `…Description`/`…Spec` (E.10.D2), EFEM laws SHALL be phrased in terms of `DescriptionContext = ⟨EntityOfConcernRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` and MUST respect the EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary, specification use/refinement gates, and DescriptionContext invariants (including DESCCTX-13 Viewpoint-locality as defined in E.10.D2/C.2.1): `Describe_EoC_DescEp` lives in A.7; `Specify_DescEp_SpecDesc` MAY be species of EFEM only as an episteme→episteme refinement and MUST preserve the `EntityOfConcern`. |
| **CC‑EFEM.8 (Slot‑level read/write declaration).**  | Any EFEM species that defines morphisms between epistemes SHALL also satisfy C.2.1 checkpoint CC‑C.2.1‑5: it MUST state whether it is a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`/`U.EpistemicViewing`/`U.EpistemicRetargeting`, declare its `entityOfConcernChangeMode`, name which SlotKinds it reads and writes, and state its behaviour on `entityOfConcernRef`, `groundingHolonRef`, `viewpointRef`, and `referenceScheme`. |

### A.6.2:7.1 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Correct action |
|---|---|---|
| EFEM as performed work | An episteme rewrite is treated as measurement, actuation, or work occurrence. | Use EFEM only for episteme-to-episteme morphisms; use A.15 when work in the world is current. |
| EFEM as publication rendering | A face, carrier, or rendering change is treated as the episteme morphism itself. | Use E.17 for publication forms and use EFEM only for the episteme relation being represented. |
| Retargeting as harmless view | EntityOfConcern changes without a declared bridge or retargeting witness. | State `EntityOfConcernChangeMode=retarget` and use the relevant KindBridge or retargeting pattern. |
| Representation lens as ontology | A category arrow, graph, or mapping notation is treated as a new root U-kind. | Keep the mathematical object as the lens over the EFEM relation and keep U-kind settlement in E.24/C.3. |

### A.6.2:9 - Consequences

* **Single place for episteme‑to‑episteme laws.**
  All effect-free transforms of knowledge epistemes, across KD‑CAL, MVPK, E.18, discipline packs, can now be defined as species of EFEM, instead of each family re‑inventing its own law set.

* **Clear separation from mechanisms & work.**
  Anything that touches the world (measurements, execution, simulation) is forced into `U.Mechanism` or performed `U.Work`, with CL‑penalised Bridges and Γ_time; EFEM remains pure and compositional.

* **Stable backbone for Viewing & Retargeting.**
  A.6.3 and A.6.4 do not need to repeat P0–P5; they specialise EFEM with additional constraints (preserve/retarget). Other patterns (e.g. MultiViewDescribing, MVPK, E.18 structural reinterpretation) can depend on EFEM as a stable base.

* **Slot‑level clarity.**
  By formulating EFEM laws in terms of SlotKinds/ValueKinds/RefKinds (A.6.5) and the EpistemeSlotRelation (C.2.1), it becomes much harder for Episteme to confuse “EntityOfConcern”, “slot in a relation”, and “reference to that entity”.

* **Better didactics.**
  The traditional “semantic triangle” becomes a didactic projection of EFEM over the EpistemeSlotRelation: EFEM + C.2.1 explain precisely what the triangle was trying to gesture at (symbol, concept, referent), while correctly foregrounding operations, viewpoints, grounding holons, and reference schemes.

### A.6.2:10 - Rationale

**Why a separate EFEM pattern (A.6.2) instead of folding into A.6.1 or C.2.1?**

* A.6.1 governs **Mechanisms** (operations with AdmissibilityConditions, Γ_time, transport and Bridges)—too operational for the pure episteme transforms we want here.
* C.2.1 fixes the **ontology of epistemes** (slots, components, ReferencePlane), but does not talk about morphisms. EFEM is explicitly a **morphism‑level** pattern over that ontology.

This split mirrors how Signature (A.6.0) separates “what is declared” from “how it is realised”: C.2.1 says what an episteme is; A.6.2 says what an admissible episteme-to-episteme transform is.

**Why insist on EntityOfConcernChangeMode?**

Because almost all subtle errors in multi‑view reasoning show up as **silent retargeting**: a transform that appears to keep the same EntityOfConcern actually changes it (e.g., from “component assembly” to “function bundle”) without naming the bridge or invariant. By forcing every species to declare `preserve` vs `retarget`, EFEM makes those decisions explicit and reviewable.

**Why attach EFEM to SlotKinds instead of informal “fields”?**

FPF already committed to a single SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline (A.6.5) across relations, methods, roles, and now epistemes. Re‑using that discipline here:

* aligns episteme morphisms with the rest of the framework;
* enables mechanised checks (e.g., that a viewing only touches slots it promised to touch);
* avoids minting yet another notion of “parameter” or “role in a relation”.

### A.6.2:10.1 - SoTA-Echoing (informative, lineage)

EFEM is intentionally “thin”: it provides a **minimal categorical and slot‑based discipline** for episteme→episteme morphisms, making it easy to align with several post‑2015 lines of work:

* **Categorical semantics & displayed categories.**
  Treating `Ep` as a category over `Ref` via a functor `α : Ep → Ref` (mapping each episteme to its EntityOfConcern) matches the *displayed categories* view on fibrations: EFEM arrows are those morphisms in `Ep` that are “vertical” (preserve α) or “structured reindexings” (retarget under a KindBridge). This is exactly the intended alignment with C.2.1’s subjectRef/ReferencePlane picture.

* **Optics as universal projections.**
  Viewing operations (`U.EpistemicViewing`) refine EFEM in a way analogous to **lenses/prisms/traversals** in the optics literature: effect‑free, compositional accessors for parts of a larger structure. EFEM captures the laws that underlie those projections (purity, conservation, functoriality); optics‑style constructions can then be used inside discipline packs without modifying the core.

* **Structured cospans & correspondences.**
  Many correspondence‑based multi‑view patterns (ISO 42010 correspondences, model synchronisation, traceability links) can be seen as spans/cospans between epistemes. EFEM ensures that the legs of such cospans are effect‑free and conservative, while CorrespondenceModels carry the extra structure needed for consistency management.

* **Bidirectional transformations (BX).**
  The “no new commitments” and “functorial & idempotent” constraints mirror modern BX practice around **consistency restoration**: EFEM is the universal core that BX‑like constructions (view updates, synchronisers) must respect when instantiated for epistemes.

EFEM does *not* prescribe a specific calculus (deductive, probabilistic, latent‑space), nor a specific representation (symbolic vs distributed); those choices are captured in `U.ClaimGraph`, `U.RepresentationScheme` and discipline‑level patterns. EFEM only says what it means to transform epistemes **admissibly** in that chosen substrate.

### A.6.2:11 - Relations

* **Specialises / is specialised by.**

  * Builds on A.6.0 `U.Signature` and A.6.1 `U.Mechanism` for the uniform SubjectBlock/vocabulary/laws/applicability structure.
  * Specialised by A.6.3 `U.EpistemicViewing` (entityOfConcern‑preserving EFEM) and A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (entityOfConcern-retargeting EFEM).

* **Constrained by.**
  A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` (SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind); C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotRelation` (episteme components, ReferencePlane); E.10.D2 (EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary and specification use/refinement gates); Part F (Bridges, CL, ReferencePlane crossings); E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE naming rules, especially on `…Slot` / `…Ref` and ban on Subject/Object in episteme tech names).

* **Consumed by.**
  E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing` (families of Description epistemes, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use, under Viewpoints); E.17 (MVPK — publication as species of Viewing/EFEM); E.18 (structural reinterpretation and other transformation-flow relations over epistemes); KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL rules that reason about episteme transforms categorically.
