## A.6.3 - `U.EpistemicViewing` — EntityOfConcern-preserving morphism
> **Status:** Stable
> **Type:** Definitional ontic pattern

**One‑line summary.** `U.EpistemicViewing` is the **EntityOfConcern-preserving** species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`: an effect‑free projection between epistemes that may change content and representation, but **never changes what the episteme is about** (the value filling `EntityOfConcernSlot` in C.2.1).
**Use this pattern when** a project needs a view, query, projection, normalization, or representation change over an episteme while preserving the same EntityOfConcern.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A view becomes a retargeting, a publication rendering becomes the episteme relation, or a representation lens silently changes what the episteme is about.

**What this buys.** A.6.3 gives the preserve branch of EFEM: `EntityOfConcernSlot` is read-only, slot changes are declared, and publication, retargeting, mechanism, and work claims stay outside viewing.

**EntityOfConcern preservation discipline.** A.6.3 names the preserve branch of the C.2.1 EntityOfConcern preservation law: `entityOfConcernRef(Y) = entityOfConcernRef(X)` and `EntityOfConcernSlot` is read-only. Source-side spellings are source wording only; conformant text normalizes them to `EntityOfConcern*` before use.

**Placement.** After **A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`**, before **A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting`**.

**Builds on.**
A.6.0 `U.Signature`; A.6.2 `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`; A.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`; A.7 and E.10.D2 (EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary and specification use/refinement discipline, `DescriptionContext`); C.2.1 `U.Episteme — Epistemes and their slot relation`; C.2 (KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL, `subjectRef`, ReferencePlane).

**Used by.**
E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`; E.17 (MVPK — Multi‑View Publication Kit); E.17.1/E.17.2 (Viewpoint bundle libraries, TEVB); B.5.3 (Role‑EpistemicViewing); discipline packs for architecture, safety, and ML/LLM‑based representations.

**Body-level U-kind settlement.** `U.EpistemicViewing` is the governed durable value in this pattern. It reuses `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` and `U.Episteme`; episteme card, view, and publication names are dependent C.2.1/E.17 values when those patterns govern them. `ClaimGraph`, `Viewpoint`, `ReferenceScheme`, and `RepresentationScheme` are C.2.1/A.6.5 slot fillers or ValueKinds. `SubjectRef` is source wiring through `DescriptionContext`. `EpMorphism` is the local mathematical-lens arrow value for viewing, not a root U-kind.

### A.6.3:1 - Problem frame

Engineers and researchers constantly need **views that preserve the same EntityOfConcern**:
* an ISO 42010‑style architectural view for a particular stakeholder group over a shared architecture description;
* a SysML v2 “view‑as‑query” over an underlying model, changing visualisation but not the modelled system;
* a publication view (Plain/Tech/Assurance) in MVPK over a common description and specification-useification;
* an LLM‑friendly episteme derived from a symbolic specification (or vice versa), preserving what system is being described.

All of these are **episteme→episteme** transforms that must:
* keep the **EntityOfConcern** fixed (`EntityOfConcernSlot` in C.2.1), and
* change only **how** the episteme talks about it: sliced `U.ClaimGraph`, different `U.Viewpoint`, alternative `U.RepresentationScheme`, or a different `U.ReferenceScheme` tuned to the same EntityOfConcern and grounding holon.

We need a single, reusable notion of **“epistemic viewing”** that captures these projections as:
* **effect‑free** (no Work/Mechanism side‑effects),
* **EntityOfConcern-preserving** (no silent retargeting),
* **conservative** (no new commitments about the EntityOfConcern),
* and **functorial** (compose cleanly in multi-step compositions).

### A.6.3:2 - Problem

Without a dedicated pattern for EpistemicViewing:
1. **Views vs retargetings blur.**
   Operations that *intend* to change only representation (viewing) are easily conflated with operations that change the **EntityOfConcern** (retargeting). A Fourier‑style transform or a structural reinterpretation in E.18 can quietly drift from “view of S” into “view of a different S′”, without declaring a `KindBridge`.

2. **“View” vs “viewpoint” vs rendered publication collapse.**
   In standards and tools, “view” is often used interchangeably to mean:
   * the **viewpoint** (specification of concerns and conformance rules),
   * the **episteme** produced under that viewpoint, and
   * the **rendered publication or carrier** (document, GUI, export, or other bearer).
     Without a clear episteme-lane notion of viewing, MVPK and E.17.0 cannot cleanly separate these lanes.

2. **No entityOfConcern guarantees.**
   A projection that looks like a harmless slice of a system description may in fact:
   * change `entityOfConcernRef` (switching to a subsystem or a function),
   * change `groundingHolonRef` (different plant or runtime),
   * or smuggle in new commitments about the EntityOfConcern.
     Without explicit invariants over C.2.1 components, “view” becomes an informal metaphor, not a reliable morphism class.

4. **Multi‑view reasoning has no core discipline.**
   Multi‑view patterns (ISO 42010 viewpoint libraries, SysML v2 view queries, TEVB, MVPK faces) need:
   * **vertical** projections that preserve `entityOfConcernRef` (`α : Ep → Ref` fixed),
   * and **correspondence‑based** projections that rely on explicit cross‑episteme links.
     If each family re‑invents its own notion of “view”, consistency and tool checks degrade.

### A.6.3:3 - Forces

* **Same EntityOfConcern, different concerns.**
  Stakeholders want different slices of the same description and specification-useification, sometimes under different viewpoints, without re-identifying the system, method, service, or other entity that fills `EntityOfConcernSlot`.

* **Internal vs cross‑episteme views.**
  Some views depend only on a single episteme (direct viewing); others depend on a **CorrespondenceModel** (e.g. aligning requirements and design models). Both are admissible, but they require **different witnesses**.

* **Conservativity vs expressivity.**
  A view must not introduce new commitments about the EntityOfConcern, but it may:

  * aggregate or factor claims,
  * change representation regime (diagrammatic vs symbolic vs latent),
  * or shift to a different inference regime, **as long as this is conservative**.

* **EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary and specification-use strictness.**
  `…Description` names a Description episteme, and `…Spec` names a Description episteme admitted for specification use whose `subjectRef` decodes to `DescriptionContext = ⟨EntityOfConcernRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` when the declared checkability/formality gate is present. Viewing works over these `DescriptionContext` triples without collapsing the EntityOfConcern into the Description episteme or Description episteme admitted for specification use produced by the use, while still allowing that EntityOfConcern to be a `U.Episteme` when an episteme is under concern; it also must not confuse those epistemes with publication faces or carriers.

* **Slot discipline and modularity.**
  With C.2.1 and A.6.5, epistemes now have explicit `SlotKind`/`ValueKind`/`RefKind` triples. Viewing invariants must be stated **per SlotKind**, not in terms of ad‑hoc “fields”, so they can be reused across engineering, publication, and discipline packs.

### A.6.3:4 - Solution — `U.EpistemicViewing` as EFEM profile (`entityOfConcernChangeMode = preserve`)

#### A.6.3:4.1 - Informal definition

> **Definition (informal).**
> `U.EpistemicViewing` is the **EntityOfConcern-preserving species** of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`.
> A `U.EpistemicViewing v : X→Y`:
>
> * takes an input episteme `X` and produces an output episteme `Y`,
> * preserves the value filling `EntityOfConcernSlot` (`entityOfConcernRef(Y) = entityOfConcernRef(X)`),
> * may refine or re‑express `content : U.ClaimGraph`, `viewpointRef`, `representationSchemeRef`, and `referenceScheme`,
> * is **effect-free and conservative** (no new commitments about the EntityOfConcern),
> * and composes functorially with other epistemic viewings.

In C.2.1 terms `U.EpistemicViewing` behaves like a **lens/optic over the episteme slot relation**: it focuses on some SlotKinds (typically `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) while preserving `EntityOfConcernSlot` (and usually `GroundingHolonSlot`).

#### A.6.3:4.2 - Signature (A.6.0 / A.6.5 alignment)

**Signature header.**
`U.EpistemicViewing` is a morphism profile under A.6.0:

```
SubjectBlock
  SubjectKind    = U.EpistemicViewing
  RangedValueKind = ⟨X:U.Episteme, Y:U.Episteme⟩      // domain/codomain episteme pair
  Quantification = SliceSet := ContextSliceSet;
                   ExtentRule := admissible view morphisms
  ResultKind     = EpMorphism                        // local typed arrow v in the Ep category
```

**Vocabulary (re‑uses A.6.2).**
* **Types.** `U.Episteme`, `SubjectRef`, `EpMorphism`, `U.EpistemicViewing`.
* **Operators.**
  * `id    : EpMorphism(X->X)`
  * `compose(g,f) : EpMorphism(X->Z)` where `f:X->Y`, `g:Y->Z`
  * `apply(v, x:U.Episteme) : U.Episteme`
  * `dom(v), cod(v) : U.Episteme`
  * `subjectRef(-) : SubjectRef`
**SlotKind-specific discipline.**
Domain and codomain epistemes are instances of some `U.Episteme` species (typically `U.EpistemeCard`, `U.EpistemeView`, or `U.EpistemePublication`) whose episteme kinds each provide SlotSpecs (A.6.5) including at least:
  * `EntityOfConcernSlot` (ValueKind `U.Entity`, RefKind `U.EntityRef`),
  * `GroundingHolonSlot?` (ValueKind `U.Holon`, RefKind `U.HolonRef`),
  * `ClaimGraphSlot` (ValueKind `U.ClaimGraph`, by‑value),
  * `ViewpointSlot?` (ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`, RefKind `U.ViewpointRef`),
  * `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (ValueKind `U.ReferenceScheme`, by‑value),
  * and, where C.2.1+ is in use, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ViewSlot` and related slots.

Practical species of EpistemicViewing will very often take `X` and `Y` from the same `U.EpistemeKind`, but the pattern itself only requires that the SlotSpecs of the domain and codomain kinds be **compatible** in the sense of A.6.5, not literally identical.

**Relation to EFEM.**
* Every `U.EpistemicViewing` is an **EFEM morphism** with `entityOfConcernChangeMode = preserve` in the sense of A.6.2/C.2.1.
* It **inherits** P0–P5 from A.6.2, specialised to the case where the value filling `EntityOfConcernSlot` is unchanged.

#### A.6.3:4.3 - Invariants (EV-0...EV-6, over C.2.1 components)

All invariants below are **in addition** to A.6.2 EFEM invariants P0-P5 and SHALL be read directly against C.2.1 components and A.6.5 SlotSpecs.

**EV‑0 - Species & EntityOfConcernChangeMode.**

* Any morphism `v:X→Y` declared as `U.EpistemicViewing` **MUST**:
  * be a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (A.6.2), and
  * declare `entityOfConcernChangeMode(v) = preserve`.
* Consequently:
  * `EntityOfConcernSlot` has the **same ValueKind and RefKind** in the episteme kind of `X` and `Y` (same `EntityOfConcernClass ⊑ U.Entity`);
  * `entityOfConcernRef(Y) = entityOfConcernRef(X)` **by definition** of the species.

**EV‑1 - Typed domain/codomain & DescriptionContext behaviour.**

For any `v:X→Y` in `U.EpistemicViewing`:
1. `X` and `Y` are instances of `U.Episteme` species whose episteme kinds both realise at least the core C.2.1 slots (`EntityOfConcernSlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot?`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot?`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) and obey A.6.5. Many practical species of EpistemicViewing will take `X` and `Y` from the **same** `U.EpistemeKind`, but the A.6.3 pattern only requires **SlotSpec compatibility** between domain and codomain kinds (in the sense of A.6.5), not literal kind equality.

2. In the SlotKind-specific read/write discipline:
   * `EntityOfConcernSlot` is **read‑only** (no change in `entityOfConcernRef`).
   * `GroundingHolonSlot`, if present, is:
     * either preserved exactly, or
     * changed only within an explicitly declared **grounding context** (e.g. normalising identifiers for the same plant or runtime), justified via a `Bridge` in the same ReferencePlane.
   * `ViewpointSlot`, if present, is:
     * either preserved (internal normalisation under the same viewpoint), or
     * changed only to another `U.ViewpointRef` **within a declared `U.MultiViewDescribing` family** (E.17.0), with a `CorrespondenceModel` providing witnesses.
3. For any episteme that is a `…Description`/`…Spec` (E.10.D2), `subjectRef` decodes to `DescriptionContext = ⟨EntityOfConcernRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`. EpistemicViewing MUST:
   * preserve `EntityOfConcernRef`,
   * preserve `BoundedContextRef` (unless a Bridge is explicitly cited),
   * treat `ViewpointRef` as in (2) above.

**EV‑2 - Effect‑free boundary (over EpistemeSlotRelation).**
EpistemicViewing remains **pure** in the EFEM sense:
* It may change **only C.2.1 components of the codomain episteme**:
  * `content : U.ClaimGraph` (e.g. filtering, aggregation, normalisation),
  * `viewpointRef` (under the constraints in EV‑1),
  * `representationSchemeRef` and `ReferenceScheme` (within a fixed representation family or under a declared `CorrespondenceModel`),
  * meta‑components (edition, provenance, status flags).
* It **MUST NOT**:
  * invoke `U.Mechanism` or perform `U.Work` (measure, execute, actuate),
  * create or modify a presentation carrier, publication carrier, file, database, or rendered artifact,
  * cross ReferencePlanes implicitly (plane crossings go through Bridges with CL penalties in Part F).

Any operational machinery (e.g. SAT/SMT solving, simulation, LLM tool‑use) MUST be modelled as a **separate `U.Mechanism`** that produces input epistemes or auxiliary epistemes or carriers consumed by the EpistemicViewing morphism.

**EV-3 - No new commitments about the EntityOfConcern.**

Let `X` and `Y = apply(v,X)` with:
* `content_X`, `referenceScheme_X`,
* `content_Y`, `referenceScheme_Y`,
* shared `entityOfConcernRef` and (typically) `groundingHolonRef`.

Then:
* The set of claims about `<entityOfConcernRef, groundingHolonRef>` obtained by interpreting `content_Y` through `referenceScheme_Y` **MUST NOT strictly extend** what is already entailed, in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL, by `content_X` interpreted through `referenceScheme_X` under the same ReferencePlane and context.
* Admissible changes:
  * re‑expression (changing representation, not truth conditions),
  * aggregation (e.g. summarising multiple claims into an explicitly derivable macro‑claim),
  * dropping some information (lossy projection), provided **no new atomic commitments** about the EntityOfConcern are introduced.
* Any deliberate strengthening of behavioural or structural commitments about the same EntityOfConcern **is not a valid EpistemicViewing**; it must be modelled either as:
  * a new or changed EntityOfConcern claim with its own Description epistemes, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use under A.7 and E.10.D2, or
  * an A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting` plus a new EntityOfConcern claim.

**EV‑4 - Functoriality & correspondence alignment.**

EpistemicViewing **inherits EFEM functoriality** and specialises it:

1. **Direct EpistemicViewing (same representation scheme).**
   Where `representationSchemeRef` and `ReferenceScheme` of `X` and `Y` are the same (up to declared normal forms), EpistemicViewing acts as a **strict functor** on ClaimGraphs:
   * `apply(id, X) = X`,
   * `apply(g ∘ f, X) = apply(g, apply(f, X))`,
   * `content` transformation corresponds to a structural ClaimGraph function.

2. **Correspondence‑based EpistemicViewing (representation changes).**
   When viewing relies on a `CorrespondenceModel` between epistemes or representation schemes:
   * the viewing morphism MUST reference that `CorrespondenceModel`,
   * compositions involving such viewings **MUST** publish witnesses (epistemes or proof epistemes or proof records) that squares commute **up to declared isomorphism** (oplax naturality is allowed, but corrections are deterministic and reproducible),
   * `entityOfConcernRef` and `groundingHolonRef` remain as in EV‑1; any transfer across contexts or planes goes via Bridges, not via hidden behaviour of the viewing.

**EV‑5 - Idempotency & determinism on fixed configuration.**

For any `v:X→Y` in `U.EpistemicViewing`, with fixed:
* `entityOfConcernRef`,
* `groundingHolonRef`,
* `viewpointRef`,
* `representationSchemeRef`,
* `referenceScheme`,
* and fixed `CorrespondenceModel` (if used),

the following MUST hold:
* **Idempotency.** `apply(v, apply(v, X))` is **isomorphic** to `apply(v, X)`:
  * same EntityOfConcern and grounding holon,
  * same viewpoint and representation scheme,
  * ClaimGraphs differ, at most, by declared structural equivalence (e.g. normal form vs source form).
* **Determinism.** For fixed input and configuration, the result is uniquely determined (modulo declared equivalence). Any source of non‑determinism (random seeds, timing, external service state) MUST either:
  * be exposed as part of `content` / `meta` of `X`, or
  * be moved into a Mechanism outside the viewing morphism.

**EV‑6 - Applicability & MultiViewDescribing alignment.**

Each species of `U.EpistemicViewing` MUST:
1. Declare an **Applicability profile** (A.6.0) specifying:
   * permitted `EntityOfConcernClass ⊑ U.Entity` (ValueKind of `EntityOfConcernSlot`),
   * permitted `groundingHolonRef` classes and ReferencePlanes,
   * admissible `viewpointRef` ranges (possibly a named `U.ViewpointBundle`),
   * admissible `representationSchemeRef` families.
1. For Description epistemes, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use in a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family (E.17.0):
   * preserve `EntityOfConcernRef` of `DescriptionContext`,
   * either preserve `ViewpointRef` or change it within the declared viewpoint bundle, with any additional constraints recorded in the family’s `CorrespondenceModel`,
   * never widen `ClaimScope` beyond what EV‑3 permits.
3. Treat **any change of EntityOfConcern** (even if “intuitively minor”, such as moving from subsystem to system) as **out of scope** for A.6.3; such moves belong to A.6.4 `U.EpistemicRetargeting`.

#### A.6.3:4.4 - Profiles: `U.DirectEpistemicViewing` and `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing`

`U.EpistemicViewing` is further structured into two important species; both inherit EV‑0…EV‑6.

1. **`U.DirectEpistemicViewing` — self‑contained views.**
   * Domain and codomain epistemes share:
     * the same `representationSchemeRef` (up to declared normalisation),
     * the same `ReferenceScheme` (or a refinement which is conservative and structurally documented).
   * No external `CorrespondenceModel` is needed: the view is computed **solely from the input episteme** and, optionally, fixed configuration.
   * Typical cases:
     * internal normalisation (sorting, rewriting) of an engineering view;
     * filtering `U.ClaimGraph` to keep only safety‑relevant claims;
     * simplifying a proof‑oriented specification to a more operational form under the same semantics.

1. **`U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` — views relying on correspondence models.**
   * Viewing depends on:
     * one or more subject epistemes (e.g. requirements and design),
     * an explicit `CorrespondenceModel` that relates their ClaimGraphs and representation schemes.
   * The result is an episteme (often an `U.EpistemeView`) whose `entityOfConcernRef` matches that of the primary episteme, but whose content is computed **through** the correspondence links.
   * Typical cases:
     * ISO 42010‑style correspondences between architectural descriptions;
     * cross‑model views in model‑based systems engineering (MBSE), where view content is computed from multiple model fragments;
     * traceability‑based views aggregating requirements, design elements, and tests.

In both profiles:
* `CorrespondenceModel` remains an **episteme-lane publication**, not a new kernel‑type hidden inside A.6.3.
* `U.EpistemicViewing` stays **view‑like**: it reveals what is already there under the correspondence; it does not perform Γ-style construction of new EntityOfConcern claims.

#### A.6.3:4.4.a - Common same-entity specialization notes

Two recurring EntityOfConcern-preserving families can be read as specializations governed by `A.6.3`, provided that EV‑0…EV‑6 remain explicit.

1. **`ConservativeRetextualization`.**
   Use this when the receiving item remains textual and the main change is wording, density, ordering, language, or bounded filtering of already available content. It stays in `A.6.3` only if `entityOfConcernRef` is preserved, no new claims about that entity are minted, and correspondence use does not collapse into bridge or substitution licence.

2. **`RepresentationSchemeTransition`.**
   Use this when the receiving item changes representation scheme or reasoning medium while still preserving the same EntityOfConcern. It stays in `A.6.3` only if representation-factor delta, recoverability, loss, and preserve-vs-retarget boundaries remain explicit. Purely textual rewrites belong with `ConservativeRetextualization`; any change of `EntityOfConcernRef` belongs with `A.6.4`.

These notes do not create new governing patterns. They mark recurring same-entity specialization boundaries that remain subordinate to `U.DirectEpistemicViewing` / `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` and to the general `A.6.3` invariants.

### A.6.3:5 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell-Show-Show)

#### A.6.3:5.1 - Engineering system description → safety officer view (DirectEpistemicViewing)

*Context.*
A system team maintains a rich `SystemDescription` episteme for a plant holon `S` under an engineering viewpoint from TEVB. A safety officer needs a concise view showing only safety‑critical components, hazards, and mitigations.

*Shape.*

* **Domain `X`.**
  `X : U.SystemDescription` with:
  * `entityOfConcernRef(X) : U.SystemRef` (the plant `S`),
  * `groundingHolonRef(X) : U.HolonRef` (runtime environment),
  * `viewpointRef(X) : U.ViewpointRef` (engineering TEVB viewpoint),
  * `content(X) : U.ClaimGraph` (full behavioural & structural claims).
* **Codomain `Y`.**
  `Y : U.EpistemeView` with:
  * `entityOfConcernRef(Y) = entityOfConcernRef(X)`,
  * `groundingHolonRef(Y) = groundingHolonRef(X)`,
  * `viewpointRef(Y)` either equal to or a refinement of the original engineering viewpoint (TEVB safety sub‑viewpoint),
  * `content(Y)` containing only safety‑relevant claims, plus explicit aggregation nodes (e.g. hazard summaries).

`SafetyView : X→Y` is a **DirectEpistemicViewing**:
* `entityOfConcernChangeMode = preserve`,
* only `content`, `viewpointRef` (within TEVB) and `meta` change,
* KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL checks show that every hazard/mitigation claim in `Y` is entailed by `X`,
* view is idempotent and deterministic given `X` and the selected safety profile.

This is the canonical “engineering view” archetype used by E.17.2/TEVB species.

#### A.6.3:5.2 - MVPK publication view normalisation (DirectEpistemicViewing)

*Context.*
MVPK emits a `TechCard` view `V_raw` for an arrow `f` in a morphism class (e.g. a **gate-checked, crossing-visible** service with `OperationalGate(profile)` + `DecisionLog`). The publication pipeline wants a normalised view `V_norm` where:
* arrows are ordered canonically,
* units and names follow a fixed naming discipline,
* redundant cells are removed.

*Shape.*

* `X = V_raw`, `Y = V_norm`, both `U.EpistemeView` instances with:
  * same `entityOfConcernRef` (the morphism’s arrow or capability),
  * same `groundingHolonRef` (runtime/plant),
  * same `viewpointRef` (publication viewpoint),
  * same `representationSchemeRef` (TechCard schema).

`NormalizeTechCard : X→Y` is a **DirectEpistemicViewing**:
* changes only `content` and `meta` (e.g. “normalised at edition E”),
* is pure and idempotent (two passes give the same normal form),
* is conservative: no new claims about the arrow `f` appear; information is only reordered or discarded.

MVPK can rely on this as an A.6.3‑conformant step without restating EFEM invariants.

#### A.6.3:5.3 - Cross‑model consistency view (CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing)

*Context.*
A system has:
* a requirements episteme `R` (“what the system should do”), and
* a design episteme `D` (“how the system does it”),

both with `entityOfConcernRef` pointing to the same system holon `S`, but living in different notations and contexts. A systems engineer wants a view that shows **only those requirements that currently have design coverage**.

*Shape.*

* `R : U.SystemRequirementsDescription` with ClaimGraph `C_R`.
* `D : U.SystemDesignDescription` with ClaimGraph `C_D`.
* `CM : U.CorrespondenceModel` relating requirements to design elements.
* `Y : U.EpistemeView` with:
  * `entityOfConcernRef(Y) = entityOfConcernRef(R) = entityOfConcernRef(D) = S`,
  * `groundingHolonRef(Y)` inherited from `R`/`D` or declared via a Bridge,
  * `content(Y)` aggregating only those requirements in `C_R` for which `CM` records coverage in `C_D`.

`CoveredRequirementsView(R,D,CM) : X→Y` (with `X` a compound episteme or a bundle episteme over `R,D,CM`) is a **CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing**:
* relies essentially on `CM` (without it, the view is undefined — fail‑closed),
* must publish witnesses that two different ways of composing local correspondences give the same result up to declared equivalence,
* remains conservative: it does not assert that any requirement is covered unless that fact is recorded in `CM` and justified in `D`.

This archetype mirrors post‑2015 work on model synchronisation and bidirectional transformations, but anchored in the EpistemeSlotRelation.

### A.6.3:6.1 - Bias-Annotation

A.6.3 deliberately biases the reader toward EntityOfConcern preservation before publication convenience. The common drift is to call every useful rendering, query, dashboard, or stakeholder-facing artifact a view; this pattern keeps the view relation as an episteme-to-episteme morphism and leaves publication forms to E.17, retargeting to A.6.4, and performed work to A.15.

### A.6.3:8 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A.6.3‑1 - EFEM species and EntityOfConcernChangeMode.**
Any pattern that claims to define `U.EpistemicViewing` **SHALL**:

* declare itself a species of `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` (A.6.2),
* fix `entityOfConcernChangeMode = preserve`,
* and state its Applicability profile (EntityOfConcernClass, contexts, viewpoints, representation schemes).

**CC-A.6.3-2 - SlotKind-specific read/write discipline.**
For each species of EpistemicViewing, the definition **MUST**:

* list the SlotKinds it **reads** (typically `EntityOfConcernSlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`),
* list the SlotKinds it **writes** (typically `ClaimGraphSlot`, optionally `ViewpointSlot`, `RepresentationSchemeSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`, and `meta`),
* assert explicitly that `EntityOfConcernSlot` is read‑only,
* and state any constraints on `GroundingHolonSlot` / `ViewpointSlot` changes.

This satisfies A.6.5 and C.2.1 checkpoint CC‑C.2.1‑5.

**CC‑A.6.3‑3 - DescriptionContext discipline (for Description epistemes, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use).**
When domain/codomain epistemes are `…Description`/`…Spec`:
* viewing invariants SHALL be phrased in terms of `DescriptionContext = ⟨EntityOfConcernRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`,
* `EntityOfConcernRef` MUST be preserved,
* `BoundedContextRef` MUST be preserved unless a Bridge is explicitly cited,
* `ViewpointRef` MUST either be preserved or changed within a declared `U.ViewpointBundle`.

**CC‑A.6.3‑4 - Conservativity witness.**
For each species, the definition SHALL provide:
* a clear statement of what counts as a **new commitment about the EntityOfConcern** in the relevant discipline,
* and a sketch of how conservativity (EV‑3) is checked or approximated (e.g. via KD‑CAL entailment, proof or structural invariants).

**CC‑A.6.3‑5 - Profile classification.**
* Species that do not require a `CorrespondenceModel` MUST be marked as `U.DirectEpistemicViewing`.
* Species that do require such a model MUST be marked as `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` and SHALL:
  * document the shape of the `CorrespondenceModel`,
  * describe how witness epistemes ensure oplax naturality of compositions.

**CC‑A.6.3‑6 - Separation from Retargeting and Mechanisms.**
* Any species that may change `entityOfConcernRef` is **not** a conformant EpistemicViewing; it MUST be treated as `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (A.6.4) or as a different pattern.
* Any species that performs measurements, actuation, or other side‑effects MUST be declared as `U.Mechanism`, performed `U.Work`, or another directly governed work/effect value and cannot be an EpistemicViewing.

### A.6.3:6.2 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Correct action |
|---|---|---|
| View as retargeting | The output episteme is about a different system, function, scale, or concern object. | Use A.6.4 or a KindBridge retargeting relation when `EntityOfConcernRef` changes. |
| View as publication face | A document, GUI, export, or dashboard is treated as the viewing morphism. | Use E.17 for publication forms and A.6.3 for the episteme relation behind the face. |
| View as mechanism or work | Query execution, measurement, or LLM generation is treated as effect-free viewing. | Use A.6.1/A.15 for the performed operation and A.6.3 only for the resulting episteme relation when it is pure and conservative. |
| View as new commitment | The view adds claims about the same EntityOfConcern without entailment or witness. | State the conservativity witness or move the strengthening claim to its governing pattern. |

### A.6.3:6 - Consequences

* **Clear separation of viewing vs retargeting.**
  `U.EpistemicViewing` and `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (A.6.4) now **cleanly separate**:

  * “view of the same EntityOfConcern” vs “description of a different entity under a bridge”, and
  * vertical morphisms (`α` fixed) vs retargeting morphisms (α changes under KindBridge).

* **Stable backbone for multi‑view patterns.**
  Multi‑view description (E.17.0), viewpoint bundle libraries (E.17.1/E.17.2), and MVPK publication now share a **single notion of view morphism**, aligned with C.2.1 slots and the EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary and specification use/refinement discipline.

* **SlotKind-specific discipline for tools.**
  Tools implementing views (queries, projections, report generators, LLM‑based summarisation) must declare:

  * which SlotKinds they read,
  * which SlotKinds they may write,
  * and that `EntityOfConcernSlot` is preserved.
    This removes ambiguity around subject/EntityOfConcern changes and enables robust static checking.

* **Alignment with modern view/query practices.**
  The pattern aligns with:
  * ISO 42010:2011/2022 and its focus on **viewpoints**, **views**, and **correspondences** over an entity of concern;
  * SysML v2 “views‑as‑queries” paradigm, where views are queries over a stable model, not new models;
  * post‑2015 work on **optics** and **displayed categories**, treating views as structured projections over a fibred category of epistemes.

### A.6.3:7 - Rationale

A.6.3 exists because useful view-like outputs are common, but only some of them are episteme-to-episteme morphisms that preserve the same EntityOfConcern. The pattern keeps viewing narrow: same EntityOfConcern, declared slot reads/writes, conservativity witness, and no performed work or publication authority.

### A.6.3:7.1 - SoTA-Echoing

* **Optics and displayed categories.**
  In categorical terms, epistemes form a category `Ep` fibred over a category of EntityOfConcern references `Ref` via `α : Ep → Ref`. EpistemicViewing corresponds to **vertical morphisms** that preserve α. Their behaviour closely tracks **profunctor optics**: the EntityOfConcernSlot plays the role of the “focus index”, while ClaimGraphs and representation schemes act as the data being transformed. Recent work on optics (2018‑onwards) provides compositional invariants that FPF leverages without committing to a specific optic calculus.

* **Multi‑view modelling and viewpoint libraries.**
  ISO 42010 and its successors, as well as MBSE practice from ~2015 onwards, have refined the separation between **viewpoints** (families of concerns, stakeholders, and notations) and **views** (instances under those viewpoints). `U.EpistemicViewing` gives FPF a substrate‑agnostic notion of “view” that can be instantiated for architecture descriptions, safety cases, or even research epistemes/publications, while TEVB and E.17.0 specialise it to engineering holons.

* **Bidirectional transformations and consistency management.**
  Modern BX research treats views and consistency restoration as structured transformations between models, with consistency relations acting as correspondences. `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` echoes this practice but insists that:
  * viewing is **non-creative** for EntityOfConcern commitments,
  * any strengthening or change of EntityOfConcern is explicitly modelled as retargeting or EntityOfConcern-claim change.

* **Hybrid symbolic/latent representations.**
  Contemporary work on LLMs and neurosymbolic systems often toggles between:
  * symbolic specifications (logical, tabular, diagrammatic), and
  * distributed or latent representations used for computation.
    By treating `U.RepresentationScheme` and `U.RepresentationOperation` as first‑class episteme components, FPF allows EpistemicViewing to range over:
  * purely symbolic projections,
  * latent‑space projections,
  * or hybrids that invoke external mechanisms before applying a pure view, without changing the core invariants.

### A.6.3:9 - Mini-checklist (for defining a view)

When you introduce a new “view” in FPF, check:
1. **Same EntityOfConcern?**
   Does `entityOfConcernRef` stay the same? If not, this is **Retargeting**, not Viewing.

2. **Which slots move?**
   Have you listed exactly which SlotKinds you read/write, and shown that `EntityOfConcernSlot` is read‑only?

3. **Conservative?**
   Can you explain, in your discipline’s terms, why the view does not introduce new claims about the same EntityOfConcern?

4. **Profile?**
   Is this a self‑contained projection (`U.DirectEpistemicViewing`) or does it depend on a `CorrespondenceModel` (`U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing`)?

5. **Context & viewpoint?**
   Have you stated:
   * the EntityOfConcernClass for `EntityOfConcernSlot`,
   * the contexts/ReferencePlanes you assume,
   * and the viewpoint bundle (if any) you operate under?

If all answers are crisp and the invariants EV-0...EV-6 are satisfied, the pattern is a good candidate for `U.EpistemicViewing`.

### A.6.3:10 - Relations

| Pattern | Relation |
|---|---|
| `A.6.2` | Supplies EFEM law, purity, conservativity, and composition discipline. |
| `A.6.4` | Governs retargeting when `EntityOfConcernRef` changes. |
| `C.2.1` | Supplies the episteme slot relation and EntityOfConcernSlot discipline. |
| `A.6.5` | Supplies SlotKind, ValueKind, and RefKind wording for view read/write declarations. |
| `E.17` and `E.17.0` | Govern publication forms, MVPK faces, and multi-view publication use that may render or carry a viewing result. |
| `C.29` | Governs mathematical-lens adequacy when optics, category, graph, matrix, embedding, or latent representation is under evaluation. |
| `A.15` and `A.6.1` | Govern performed work and mechanisms that may produce input epistemes or viewing outputs but are not themselves effect-free viewing. |
