## A.6.F - Function and Functional Precision Restoration (RPR-FUNCTION)

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### A.6.F:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when `function`, `functional`, `functionality`, `effect`, or a similar function-like phrase carries an FPF-governed use beyond ordinary prose. The reading to inspect may concern architecture, work, method, capability, role, quality, mathematics, module allocation, an interface, or another claim named by value. These are recognition and dispatch possibilities, not one semantic kind.

The first useful move is small:

```text
FunctionUseRepair:
phrase:
sourceCueText?:
functionLikeReadingUnderRepair:
exactGovernedObjectOrClaim:
directRelationPredicateUse?:
relationalAssertionUse?:
obtainingRelationOccurrenceUse?:
reusableDeclarationUse?:
selectedClaimBearingEpistemeUse?:
representationUse?:
directGoverningPatternApplicationRefs?:
blockedLocalOverreadRefs:
nextAdmissibleUse:
stopCondition:
```
Stop when the source cue, exact governed entity, value, claim, or claim-bearing episteme, direct owner, the one local overread that would change this repair, and the next admissible use are clear. If the next step must test whether named participants stand in a relation, add its admitted direct predicate. If it must preserve an affirmative, negative, or modal claim about that predicate, identify the exact `C.2.1` relational-assertion episteme and its claim. If it must track one particular obtaining instance, apply the direct owner's identity rule and add the separately individuated occurrence. Otherwise leave those three branches empty. Add reusable declaration, other selected assertion, specification, or view episteme, or representation correspondence only when the next step needs it.

What goes wrong if A.6.F is missed: a function becomes a root kind; functional architecture becomes a peer ontology beside architecture; a capability becomes a function; a method or work occurrence becomes a function; a mathematical function becomes design ontology; a module allocation becomes functional truth; or a quality claim hides behind "functionality".

What A.6.F buys in practice: the practitioner can keep useful engineering language while naming the exact governed object or claim and going straight to its direct owner. Direct participation, reusable declaration, claim-bearing description, and representation remain separate instead of becoming one generic function record.

Not this pattern when the phrase is ordinary prose and carries no FPF claim being made. If the issue under repair is a general relation word, evaluative language, grounded architecture adequacy, or an architecture structural view, use `A.6.P`, `C.16.Q`, `C.30`, or `C.30.ASV` respectively.

**E.10.ARCH governing-pattern relation.** When `E.10` encounters function-like wording whose exact governed entity, value, claim, claim-bearing episteme, direct relation, or governing pattern is hidden, `E.10.ARCH` may apply `A.6.F` until that object and the remaining action are clear or the wording is lowered to ordinary prose, quote-only wording, reduced-use cue, blocked use, or incomplete rewrite. A direct relation names its actual participants; a reusable `RelationSignature` and declaration-local `SlotSpec`s, selected assertion, specification, or view episteme, and C.29 representation correspondence are added only for a current receiving use. After recovery, apply the direct governing pattern; `A.6.F` does not own architecture, mathematics, quality, work, evidence, assurance, gate, decision, or release claims by function wording alone.

### A.6.F:2 - Problem

FPF texts repeatedly use function-like wording for different FPF kinds and relations:

- required transformation or effect in an architecture view;
- capability of a holon;
- method wording;
- work occurrence or work result;
- role expectation or responsibility;
- mathematical function or relation;
- quality, fitness, or characteristic wording;
- module allocation or interface relation;
- functional architecture shorthand.

These uses are all legitimate in ordinary engineering speech. They are not the same FPF object or claim. If the text does not name the exact governed entity, value, claim, or claim-bearing episteme and its direct owner, subsequent reasoning cannot tell whether the sentence is about architecture, behavior, work, role, mathematics, module structure, quality, evidence, or decision. When a separate direct relation, reusable declaration, assertion or specification, selected view, or representation is current, identify it as that separate object.

### A.6.F:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Familiar engineering speech vs object and claim precision | Engineers naturally say "function", "functional", and "functionality"; when the phrase carries an FPF claim, the exact governed entity, value, claim, or claim-bearing episteme and its direct owner must be recoverable. |
| Functional architecture vs peer ontology | Functional architecture is useful, but it is the `FunctionalStructure` case of `ArchitectureOf@Context`, not a separate root architecture kind. |
| Capability or effect vs work or method | A function-like phrase may describe what a holon can do, what a method prescribes, or what work has done; those are separately governed values, claims, epistemes, and, where applicable, direct relations. |
| Mathematical function vs design relation | Mathematical functions and relations can be used for reasoning, but C.29 governs their lens use and stop condition. |
| Module allocation vs functional relation | Functional dependencies may be allocated to modules, but function and module-interface structure do not become one FPF kind. |
| Small repair vs unneeded evidence, quality, decision, or assurance apparatus | Most cases need the exact governed object or claim, its direct owner, and a stop condition. Add direct-relation participants, reusable declaration, selected claim-bearing episteme, or representation correspondence only when the current use needs that object. |

### A.6.F:4 - Solution

A.6.F is an A.6.P RPR specialization for function-like wording. It does not mint `U.Function`. It assigns the use under repair to an exact governed entity, value, claim, or claim-bearing episteme and its direct governing pattern, then stops unless another claim remains current. It does not package direct relations, declaration-local `SlotSpec`s, assertions, specifications, views, and representation elements as peer records.

#### A.6.F:4.1 - Trigger rule

A.6.F applies when function-like wording may carry one or more of these separately governed readings. The list is a recognition and dispatch palette, not a `U.*` kind, claim kind, relation kind, or admission result:

- architecture or functional architecture;
- capability, effect, externally promised behavior, or user-visible functionality;
- method wording, work occurrence, or work result;
- role expectation or responsibility;
- mathematical function, mapping, relation, loss, objective, or value functional;
- quality, fitness, characteristic, score, or proxy wording;
- module allocation, interface, signature, port, API, protocol, flow, or mechanism relation;
- another separately governed claim named by value, such as evidence, assurance, gate, decision, or release.

If none of those readings carries a current FPF-governed claim, the wording may remain ordinary Plain prose.

#### A.6.F:4.2 - FunctionUseRepair

`FunctionUseRepair` is a pattern-local repair note. Its `functionLikeReadingUnderRepair` value only helps a reader recognize and dispatch a possible reading; neither that value nor the three scan groups below is a `U.*` kind, claim kind, relation kind, or admission result. The recovered result belongs in `exactGovernedObjectOrClaim` under its direct owner. The note carries no project-publication, evidence, decision, or `U.Function` authority. `FunctionalStructure` is an `ArchitectureStructureKindRef` value under C.30.ASV, not a kernel Function kind.

```
The repair is complete when a practitioner can name the exact governed object or claim, apply its direct owner, and state the remaining action. At least one exact entity or value, claim or claim content, or claim-bearing episteme is required in `exactGovernedObjectOrClaim`. A source cue stays in `sourceCueText`; it is not a recovered value. When a direct relation is current, first name its admitted kind, semantic predicate, and actual participants in `directRelationPredicateUse`. Add `relationalAssertionUse` only when one exact `C.2.1` episteme affirms, denies, or otherwise modalizes that predicate. Add `obtainingRelationOccurrenceUse` only when the receiving use needs one separately individuated obtaining occurrence under the direct owner's identity rule, applied through `A.6.REL`; a predicate or assertion never supplies occurrence identity. Add a reusable `RelationSignature` and declaration-local `SlotSpec`s only for reusable typed use; add another selected assertion, specification, or view episteme only when it is a separate claim-bearing object; add a C.29 representation element and explicit correspondence only when representation matters. If the text still hides a function, capability, work, method, role, module, evidence, gate, or mathematical-function collapse, the repair is incomplete.

#### A.6.F:4.3 - Repair assignments

When a function-like phrase is claim-bearing, recover the exact object or claim under concern before lowering or rewriting the phrase. FPF treats `FunctionalElement@Context` as a view-local functional-structure object under C.30.ASV when stable identity, bearer, behavior, ports, capability, and allocation obligations are all current; otherwise A.6.F stops at the smaller exact requirement, behavior or effect claim, capability, participant, condition, port specification, or other directly governed object. A field name or source cue is not a substitute for that object.

**Method-description guard.** A procedure, code file, solver model, recipe, protocol, or algorithm is only a clue. First identify the knowledge object and the exact method it is about. Then point to at least one claim that says how that method is done, such as its transformation or enactment concern, applicability, precondition, intended effect or preserved condition, bound, generic participant meaning, or internal method composition. Only then classify that already identified `U.Episteme` as `U.MethodDescription` under A.3.2. A title, author, citation, approval, file form, or runnable artifact alone is a near-miss. If no admitted `U.Method` is its exact `EntityOfConcern`, or no way-of-doing claim is present, do not use `U.MethodDescription`: keep the actual plan, work, result, formal substrate, mechanism declaration, representation, publication occurrence or form, or carrier with its direct owner. A different code, text, diagram, or publication form does not decide membership. If claim content, exact method, or effective reference scheme changes, C.2.1 first identifies the resulting episteme; then apply A.3.2 to that individual.

| Function wording use | Exact governed object or claim and direct owner | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| required or desired functional behavior, transformation, or effect | Keep the requirement or other claim about the required or desired behavior or effect with its exact requirement, architecture, capability-gap, functional-view, method, or other claim-bearing owner. Use `U.Transformation` only for one independently grounded actual bounded change under A.3.4. Use `TransformationFlowStructure` only for an independently selected structure over governed loci, not for the required effect itself. | Requirement wording does not establish an occurrence or make `FunctionalElement@Context.functionalBehaviorRef` point to an actual `U.Transformation`. Stop at the claim owner unless the changed referent, boundary, conditions, actual before/during/after facts, and continuity or reidentification rule are grounded. A functional view may relate the required claim, selected structure, bearer candidate, capability, and allocation without saying that the change occurred. |
| functional element in a view | `FunctionalElement@Context` inside `FunctionalStructureView@Context` when selected view, bounded context, functional behavior, and bearer or candidate-bearer locus are current | Not `U.Function`, not a loose table row, and not the module by default. If no bearer or candidate allocation is current, keep the requirement, required-behavior claim, required-effect claim, capability gap, or functional-behavior claim with its direct owner rather than claiming a full functional element. |
| transformer-side filler and candidate bearer | For a design-only candidate, keep the candidate transformer-side System locus or candidate System reference without asserting a role assignment or performed Work. When `TransformerRole` is current, name one exact obtaining `RA : U.RoleAssignment`, its admitted holder `S : U.System = RA.HolderSystemSlot`, role-taxonomy episteme, and effective reference scheme under `A.2.1`. When performed Work is current, also name exact `W : U.Work` and state `S performed W under RA` or `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` under `F.6`. Coordinate the selected locus with `A.3.4 TransformerRef?`, `A.7`, `A.15`, `A.15.1`, and `A.15.2` only for the claims that are actually current. | A functional element may recover one of these loci, but it is not the whole transformer ontology. Device cues and transformer-bearer cues recover a candidate locus without minting a durable transformer kind or forcing role and Work apparatus into a design-only use. |
| input condition, output condition, and functional ports | `A.3.4 InputConditionRefs?`, `OutputConditionRefs?`, and `FunctionalPortRefs?`; `U.Signature` discipline through `A.6.0` and `A.6.5` when accepted or produced states, media, flows, signals, information, work products, formal objects, or functional port signatures matter | A functional port is not automatically a module interface. Use A.6.M only when module-interface or substitution compatibility is the claim. |
| capability of a holon | the exact `U.Capability` value or capability claim under its direct governing pattern | Does not imply that a method, module, work occurrence, or successful transformation exists. |
| method or algorithm wording | `U.Method` only when the claim concerns a reusable semantic way of doing; `U.MethodDescription` only for an already identified `U.Episteme` that passes the A.3.2 guard above: one admitted `U.Method` is its exact `EntityOfConcern` and at least one claim says how that method is done | Procedure, code, solver, recipe, protocol, and algorithm forms are clues only; they establish neither membership, execution, nor evidence. |
| mechanism wording | `U.Mechanism` through `A.6.1` and `E.20` when a law-governed realization or operation structure is the claim | Does not become method, work, capability, or functional element by label. |
| work plan, work occurrence, or work result | Recover the exact `U.WorkPlan` under `A.15.2`, one exact dated `W : U.Work` under `A.15.1`, or the separately identified result entity or episteme under its direct result owner. Use `A.15.PROD` when production, entity inception, or production completion is current, and `A.6.RCD` only when the needed direct result relation has no current governor. | A plan, Work occurrence, and result are different objects. None implies reusable function ontology or completed functioning, and a result is not part of Work identity. |
| responsibility or role expectation | Recover `VP.AllocationResponsibility` or the exact responsibility relation. When a work-facing role assignment is current, name one exact obtaining `RA : U.RoleAssignment` and admitted holder `S : U.System = RA.HolderSystemSlot` under `A.2.1`; when performed Work is also current, name exact `W : U.Work` and the F.6 attribution `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` or `S performed W under RA`. | A responsibility or role claim does not by itself establish performed Work or capability. Do not treat a role label, source holder label, or non-System holon as the performer. |
| mathematical function or relation | C.29 mathematical-lens use with domain, codomain or relation domain, preserved and lost structure, lens-use admissibility value, and stop condition | Does not become architecture, evidence, causal proof, assurance, or decision claim by itself. |
| quality or fitness expression | `C.25`, `C.16`, `C.16.Q`, `A.17`, `A.18`, or an admitted characteristic or measurement governing pattern according to the claim being made | Does not let "functionality" carry a quality claim without bearer and governing pattern. |
| module allocation | `FunctionalStructureView@Context` plus declared correspondence, allocation, retargeting, or `A.6.M` module-relation repair when a module-interface claim is being made | Does not make function and module one FPF kind; allow one module to realize many functional elements, many modules to realize one functional element, abstract functional elements before allocation, and modules with no current functional behavior in a view. |
| interface relation, module-interface relation, or signature relation | Use `A.6.RSIR` first when bare interface, API, port, protocol, or service-access wording could point to several direct EoCs; then use the module-interface boundary note governed by `A.6.M` and signature discipline governed by `A.6.0` and `A.6.5`, with `A.6.B`, `A.6.C`, or `A.6.P:4.11a` only when that boundary, contract, API, protocol, service, promise, or duty claim is being made | Does not turn a functional link, port label, API name, or signature into implemented compatibility. |
| evidence, result, assurance, gate, decision, or publication claim | the direct evidence, result, assurance, gate, decision, publication, or source pattern named by value | Function wording can point to these claims, but it does not authorize or prove them by itself. |
| functional architecture | `ArchitectureOf@Context` whose `structureKindRefs` includes `FunctionalStructure`, with `FunctionalStructureView@Context` under C.30.ASV when that selected view changes action | Not a peer architecture ontology, selected transformation-flow structure, or mathematical graph description by itself. |

**Required-versus-actual check.** “The cooling loop shall reduce outlet temperature by 8 °C within 60 seconds” remains a requirement or functional-view claim; by itself it identifies no `U.Transformation`. If a later run actually changes the loop state, identify that cooling occurrence separately under A.3.4 from the changed loop, exact boundary and conditions, actual before/during/after facts, and continuity or reidentification rule. Requirement-only material is the countercase and stop: it cannot admit an actual transformation, observed functioning, or evidence of success.

#### A.6.F:4.4 - Functional architecture boundary

Functional architecture is the `FunctionalStructure` case of `ArchitectureOf@Context`: the declared organization used to relate one selected functional structure to separately governed claims about required behavior or effects, capabilities, functional dependencies, and constraints that a holon is to realize, before or alongside allocation to modules, roles, work, evidence, control relations, selected transformation-flow structures, or mathematical descriptions of those structures.

```text
Functional architecture shorthand:
  open the `ArchitectureOf@Context` form in the current C.30 edition;
  name the exact described holon;
  require `structureKindRefs` to include `FunctionalStructure`;
  include only independently selected `U.StructureRef` values;
  fill every other C.30 field required by this architecture use.
```
The view keeps requirement, required-behavior/effect, capability, dependency, and constraint claims with their direct owners; their wording does not turn them into `U.StructureRef` values or actual transformations. An actual-transformation reference is admissible only after A.3.4 independently grounds the occurrence. A selected `TransformationFlowStructure`, path slice, crossing, flow valuation, or mathematical description may be related to functional structure through `C.30.TFS-REL`, `E.18`, or `E.18.2`, but it is neither the required effect nor the functional architecture itself unless the positive selected-structure co-reference check succeeds.

#### A.6.F:4.5 - Function-flow-module alignment note

Use this note when functional wording touches flow or module allocation but does not yet require a full structural view or `A.6.M` module-relation repair.

```text
FunctionFlowModuleAlignmentNote:
required function or effect:
flow path or dependency:
proposed module allocation:
role, work, or evidence consequence:
known mismatch:
governingPatternApplicationRefs:
admissible use:
non-admissible use:
```

The note records only the local function-flow-module alignment and boundary. Functional architecture, module relation, implemented-interface, evidence-sufficiency, and architecture-decision claims remain with their governing patterns.

#### A.6.F:4.6 - Common kind and relation separations

| Confusion | Repair |
| --- | --- |
| function = module | Keep `VP.Functional` and `VP.ModuleInterface` distinct; connect them through declared correspondence, allocation, retargeting, or `A.6.M` module-relation repair. |
| function = capability | Capability belongs to a holon. Keep a required or desired behavior/effect as claim content under its requirement, architecture, capability-gap, functional-view, method, or other direct owner; neither that claim nor the capability establishes an actual transformation. |
| function = work | One `W : U.Work` is a dated world-side occurrence. Its result or output is a separately identified entity or episteme connected, when current, through its direct result or production relation; use `A.15.PROD` for production, inception, or completion and `A.6.RCD` only for a needed relation with no current governor. Function wording remains design-side or description-side content unless an exact work-facing claim is current. |
| function = method | Method is a reusable way of doing. A method claim may state an intended effect, but that effect is neither the method nor an actual `U.Transformation`; apply A.3.4 only when the actual change occurrence is independently grounded. |
| function = role | Role-assignment and responsibility structure uses `VP.AllocationResponsibility`, exact `U.Role` values, `U.RoleAssignment` occurrences, and separately governed responsibility claims; function-like responsibility wording must name the current assignment or responsibility relation. |
| mathematical function = holon purpose | Use C.29 for mathematical function or relation; recover domain, codomain or relation domain, preserved and lost structure, lens-use admissibility value, and stop condition. |
| functional diagram = evidence | Diagram is a view or publication; evidence claim uses `A.10` or `G.6`. |
| functionality = quality | Recover the quality bearer and governing pattern through `C.25`, `C.16`, or C.16.Q before using the wording as an adequacy claim. |

#### A.6.F:4.7 - Composability and compositionality

Composability and quality compositionality are separate claims. If the text says parts can be assembled, keep that as a structure or use claim. If it says a quality of the whole follows from parts, assign the quality-composition claim to `C.25` and C.16-backed measurement or quality claim:

```text
Composability:
  exactGovernedObjectOrClaim: the claim content "A and B can be assembled under interface X."
  directRelationPredicateUse?: the A.6.M-admitted module-allocation or module-interface predicate, with the actual participants required by that predicate
  relationalAssertionUse?: the exact interface-specification episteme and its affirmative assembly or compatibility claim, including the predicate, polarity, and actual participants, when that assertion is current
  obtainingRelationOccurrenceUse?: not used for the current A.6.M branch; open this field only if a direct module-relation owner supplies a same-versus-new-occurrence rule and the receiving use must distinguish one obtaining episode through A.6.REL
  reusableDeclarationUse?: one compatible RelationSignature and its declaration-local SlotSpecs, only when repeated typed use needs them
  directGoverningPatternApplicationRefs: A.6.M for the module-interface predicate and claim; C.2.1 for the relational-assertion episteme; A.6.REL only after the direct owner supplies an identity rule and one obtaining occurrence must be distinguished; A.6.0 and A.6.5 only for the reusable declaration
Quality compositionality:
  exactGovernedObjectOrClaim: the affected Q-Bundle and the exact structural-characteristic, causal-hypothesis, or evidence-relation claim that this use relies on
  directRelationPredicateUse?: the exact C.16, C.16.Q, or A.10-governed predicate and its actual participants, only when that relation is current
  relationalAssertionUse?: the exact C.2.1 episteme and its affirmative, negative, or modal quality or evidence claim when that assertion is current
  directGoverningPatternApplicationRefs: C.25; C.16 or C.16.Q; A.10 only when evidence provenance is the claim being made
Non-admissible:
  successful assembly is not quality propagation
```
Compositional formalisms may express explicit composition structures and view or model relations. They do not make safety, latency, reliability, or another quality propagate automatically.

```text
CompositionalityClaim@Quality ::= {
  affectedQBundleRef,
  partStructureRefs,
  wholeStructureRef,
  compositionRelation,
  lensUseAdmissibilityValue,
  nonAdmissibleUse
}
```

#### A.6.F:4.8 - Worked slices

**Function-like relation; assertion enough.** A release note says, “The brake-control functional package is in the vehicle-control system.” The head noun is `package`; do not turn the modifier `functional` into `U.Function`. For this use, recover this concrete result:

- `directRelationPredicateUse`: the A.6.M `moduleIn` predicate `moduleIn(BrakeControllerPackage, VehicleControlSystem)` under `Release-2026Q2`, `VP.ModuleInterface`, `BrakeControlBoundary`, and `BrakeControlInterfaceSpec-v5`; the actual relation participants are `BrakeControllerPackage` and `VehicleControlSystem`;
- `relationalAssertionUse`: `BrakeArchitectureNote_v3 : U.Episteme` under C.2.1 affirms that exact predicate for those participants;
- `obtainingRelationOccurrenceUse`: `not used`, because the release question needs the current assertion but does not distinguish repeated obtaining episodes;
- remaining action: apply A.6.M to the declared interface and admissibility conditions; do not infer a function allocation or implemented compatibility from the source phrase.

**Interrupted relation; occurrence identity needed.** A maintenance log says, “Robot-7 resumed its inspection function after a documented period with no inspection assignment.” Treat `function` as a cue and test the direct assignment predicate under A.2.1 over the actual participants `Robot-7 : U.System`, `InspectorRole`, `MaintenanceRoles-2026`, and `Maintenance-Scheme-A`. Keep `Robot7AssignmentLog_42` as the separate C.2.1 episteme that states the interval facts. A.2.1 says that the demonstrated non-assignment period ends the first assignment occurrence and the later resumption begins another. When the maintenance history must distinguish them, apply A.6.REL with that identity rule to keep `InspectorAssignment_PreGap` and `InspectorAssignment_PostGap` distinct. Do not merge the two occurrences merely because all four participant names match.

**Functional architecture phrase.** A team says, "the functional architecture is the user journey." A.6.F does not let the phrase create a separate architecture kind. The repair is:

```text
FunctionUseRepair:
phrase: "functional architecture"
functionLikeReadingUnderRepair: functionalArchitecture
exactGovernedObjectOrClaim: the `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim record whose `structureKindRefs` includes `FunctionalStructure`
selectedClaimBearingEpistemeUse: the exact `FunctionalStructureView@Context` episteme when that selected view changes action
directGoverningPatternApplicationRefs: C.30; C.30.ASV
blockedLocalOverreadRefs: user journey publication, work log, selected transformation-flow structure, mathematical graph description, module diagram
nextAdmissibleUse: open C.30.ASV only if the selected functional structure changes action
stopCondition: ordinary phrase remains Plain if no architecture claim is being made
```
**Functionality as quality.** A product note says, "new functionality improves adequacy." The repair separates the exact added-capability or required-effect claim from the quality claim. Capability or effect wording may stay as recognition, but the adequacy claim goes to `C.25`, `C.16`, C.16.Q, or the admitted characteristic or measurement owner that states its bearer and criterion. A.6.F stops once those exact claims and direct owners are clear; it adds no reusable declaration, view, or representation apparatus unless the receiving use actually needs it.

**Mathematical function or loss.** A model note says, "the loss function explains the holon purpose." The repair keeps the mathematical function under C.29 lens discipline: domain, codomain or relation domain, preserved and lost structure, lens-use admissibility value, and stop condition. The loss may inform a reasoning move; it does not become holon purpose, evidence sufficiency, causal proof, assurance, or project decision by itself.

**Pump-station functional dependency.** A maintenance note says, "the backup pump function is degraded." A.6.F first separates the required effect, the exact `U.Capability` value or capability claim, the physical module allocation, the performed maintenance work, the evidence relation, and the quality claim. The functional wording may open a `FunctionalStructure` view under C.30.ASV or go to the capability owner; it does not by itself prove the pump was tested, authorize operation, or make the backup module compatible with the main line.

**Product-platform allocation.** A hardware team says, "thermal management functionality moved to the chassis." The repair separates required heat-removal effect, module allocation, interface constraints, signature constraints, architecture structural view, and any evidence or gate claim. A.6.F keeps the function-like wording useful for architecture work while sending module-interface and evidence claims to their governing patterns.

### A.6.F:5 - Archetypal Grounding

| Tell-Show-Show row | Grounding |
| --- | --- |
| Tell | A practitioner reads "the function", "functional architecture", or "this functionality" and needs to know whether the sentence is about capability, effect, method, work, role, module allocation, mathematical relation, quality, or architecture. A.6.F asks for the exact governed object or claim and its direct owner before the phrase carries an FPF claim. |
| Show: `U.System` | A robot, software system, plant, product platform, or AI-agent system may have capabilities, required effects, control functions, module allocations, runtime flows, and user-visible functionality. Those are not one FPF object; A.6.F identifies the exact entity, value, claim, episteme, or direct relation current in each use and sends it to its direct governing pattern. |
| Show: `U.Episteme` — method-description case | An algorithm file is not automatically a method description. It passes the A.3.2 membership test only when one identified claim-bearing episteme has one admitted exact `U.Method` as its `EntityOfConcern` and says substantively how that method is done. File form, name, author, citation, approval, or executability alone is the near-miss; stop at the direct representation, publication, form, carrier, or other current owner. |
| Show: `U.Episteme` — other function-like claims | A functional diagram, SysML or architecture view or note, generated-code architecture note, benchmark report, or mathematical model may cue a claim-bearing episteme; a publication form can express its selected edition and a publication occurrence can make that edition available. Read the claim before the form: send architecture and view claims to C.30 or C.30.ASV and any correspondence to its exact representation owner; keep a benchmark report as an episteme/publication rather than evidence or a method description, and require an exact A.10 or G.6 evidence relation before using it as support; send a mathematical or formal claim to its direct owner and use C.29 when a mathematical-lens use is current. Neither the episteme, publication occurrence, form, carrier, nor correspondence becomes the function, capability, work, evidence relation, architecture, or mathematical object by its form. |

### A.6.F:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Arch**, **Ontology and episteme**, **Prag**, **Did**, **Gov**. Scope: function-like wording that carries an FPF claim being made across FPF.

| Bias risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Function-root bias | The pattern explicitly does not mint `U.Function`; it sends the exact governed object or claim to its direct owner. |
| Functional-architecture exception bias | Functional architecture is normalized as `FunctionalStructure`, not a peer ontology. |
| Module bias | Function-to-module allocation uses correspondence or `A.6.M` module-relation repair; function and module remain distinct. |
| Mathematical bias | Mathematical function wording is assigned to C.29 when used as a lens. |
| Check-only bias | Every conformance item carries a repair action or governing-pattern application. |

This checklist verifies the preceding guidance after the practitioner has chosen the selected repair action; it is not a required project control form and not a substitute for the card, note, view, relation, or repair guidance above.

### A.6.F:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Failed-check repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC-A6F-1 Exact object or claim.** | Every function-like phrase that carries an FPF claim names its direct owner and at least one exact governed entity or value, claim or claim content, or claim-bearing episteme. When a direct relation is current, the admitted kind and semantic predicate are distinguished from the `C.2.1` relational-assertion episteme and from any separately individuated obtaining occurrence; each current branch names its actual participants, and neither a predicate nor an assertion supplies occurrence identity. A reusable declaration appears only when typed reuse is current; another selected assertion, specification, or view appears only when that claim-bearing episteme is current; representation correspondence appears only when representation is current. | Complete the `FunctionUseRepair` distinction or demote the phrase to Plain prose. |
| **CC-A6F-2 No `U.Function`.** | The use does not mint or rely on `U.Function` as a new root kind. | Assign the use to functional view, capability, method, work, role, mathematical lens, quality or characteristic, module allocation, or governing pattern. |
| **CC-A6F-3 Functional architecture expansion.** | Functional architecture expands to an `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim record whose `structureKindRefs` includes `FunctionalStructure`, and to C.30.ASV only when a selected functional-structure view changes action. The `@Context` suffix neither fills nor removes a claim-record field: open the governing C.30 edition and fill its current form. | Add the exact claim-record expansion and, when needed, the selected view; otherwise keep the phrase as ordinary recognition wording. |
| **CC-A6F-4 Function and capability split.** | Capability claims and function or effect claims remain distinct. | Send the exact `U.Capability` value or capability claim to its direct owner and keep the required behavior or effect claim with its requirement, functional view, method, or other exact claim-bearing owner. |
| **CC-A6F-4A Required-effect and actual-change split.** | A required or desired behavior/effect remains claim content; every `U.Transformation` reference has an independent A.3.4 occurrence basis. | If only requirement, architecture, method, desired-effect, diagram, or assertion material is available, stop before `U.Transformation`. If an actual change is current, identify its changed referent, boundary, conditions, actual facts, and continuity or reidentification rule separately. |
| **CC-A6F-5 Function, work, and method-description split.** | Method, `U.MethodDescription` membership, work occurrence, and work result claims do not hide inside function wording; source form does not establish membership. | For a reusable way-of-doing claim, recover the exact `U.Method` under A.3.1. For `U.MethodDescription`, first identify the C.2.1 episteme, its exact admitted `U.Method` as `EntityOfConcern`, and at least one substantive way-of-doing claim under A.3.2. Otherwise use the direct plan, work, result, representation, publication, or other owner. |
| **CC-A6F-6 Function and role split.** | Responsibility or role expectation wording uses `VP.AllocationResponsibility` and role-assignment or responsibility relations when a role claim is being made. | Add the role-assignment or responsibility relation or remove the role claim from the function phrase. |
| **CC-A6F-7 Mathematical function boundary.** | Mathematical function or relation wording used to justify reasoning names C.29 lens fields and stop condition. | Add C.29 lens-use admissibility value, preserved and lost structure, and stop condition, or mark mathematical use as ordinary. |
| **CC-A6F-8 Quality and functionality boundary.** | Quality, fitness, characteristic, score, or "functionality" wording recovers bearer and governing pattern. | Assign the claim to `C.25`, `C.16`, `C.16.Q`, `A.17`, `A.18`, or the characteristic named by value or measurement governing pattern according to the asserted quality, characteristic, measurement, or comparison claim. |
| **CC-A6F-9 Module-interface boundary.** | Functional relation, module allocation, interface, signature, port, API, protocol, flow, and mechanism wording remain separated. | Add `A.6.RSIR` interface-cue recovery, `FunctionFlowModuleAlignmentNote`, a module-interface boundary note governed by `A.6.M`, signature-discipline note governed by `A.6.0` and `A.6.5`, declared correspondence, declared allocation, or `A.6.M` module-relation repair. |
| **CC-A6F-10 Useful action.** | The repair leaves a remaining admissible use: apply the direct owner to the exact object or claim; open a functional view; add an alignment note; add the admitted direct-relation predicate, relational assertion, separately individuated obtaining occurrence, reusable declaration, selected claim-bearing episteme, or representation correspondence only for a named use; assign the claim to C.29, C.30, C.30.ASV, A.15, C.25, C.16, A.10, B.3, A.20, A.21, or C.11; or stop. | Restore that use, or classify the phrase as reduced-use cue, quote-only wording, blocked transfer, or incomplete rewrite. |

### A.6.F:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Root function kind** | The text treats function as a new universal FPF kind. | Use `FunctionUseRepair` to name the exact governed object or claim and apply its direct governing pattern. |
| **Functional architecture exception** | Functional architecture is treated as a peer architecture ontology. | Expand to `FunctionalStructure` under `ArchitectureOf@Context` and C.30.ASV. |
| **Capability collapse** | What the holon can do is treated as a functional dependency or vice versa. | Split capability claim from functional relation or effect claim. |
| **Work collapse** | Work occurrence or result is described as a function. | Assign occurrence or result claims to A.15 and P2W and keep functional wording design-side unless a work-evidence claim is being made. |
| **Algorithm-form shortcut** | Procedure, code, solver, recipe, protocol, or algorithm form is treated as proof of `U.MethodDescription` membership. | Recover the claim-bearing C.2.1 episteme, one admitted `U.Method` as its exact `EntityOfConcern`, and at least one substantive way-of-doing claim under A.3.2; otherwise keep the source form with its direct owner. |
| **Mathematical-function import** | A mathematical function, loss, objective, or value functional becomes design ontology. | Use C.29 and state preserved and lost structure plus stop condition. |
| **Module allocation shortcut** | A function is considered implemented because a module is named. | Add correspondence, allocation, module-interface boundary, signature-discipline boundary, or `A.6.M` module-relation repair. |
| **Functionality as quality proxy** | "Functionality" carries adequacy or quality claim without bearer and governing pattern. | Recover bearer and governing pattern through `C.25`, `C.16`, C.16.Q, or an admitted characteristic or measurement governing pattern. |
| **Sterile kind repair** | The wording is typed but no useful move remains. | Restore the direct action on the exact object or claim: apply its owner, open the selected view, add the needed alignment or correspondence, or stop the stronger reading. |

### A.6.F:9 - Consequences

| Benefit | Cost or trade-off |
| --- | --- |
| Function-like prose remains usable without minting `U.Function`. | Claim-bearing uses must name the exact governed object or claim and direct owner; additional relation, declaration, assertion, specification, view, or representation objects appear only for a named use. |
| Functional architecture becomes a normal architecture-by-structure-kind case. | C.30 or C.30.ASV may be needed when the phrase carries an architecture claim. |
| Capability, method, work, role, mathematical, quality, module, and interface claims stay separable. | One familiar word may require several separately governed objects or claims when several readings are current. |
| C.29, C.25, C.16, A.15, C.30, and `A.6.M` govern only the claims that belong to them. | A conforming use stops once the exact object or claim, direct owner, and remaining action are clear instead of opening all possible governing patterns. |

### A.6.F:10 - Rationale

Function-like wording is too useful to ban and too overloaded to leave ungoverned. The smallest useful repair is not a new ontology or a generic record. Name the exact governed entity, value, claim, or claim-bearing episteme, apply its direct owner, say what the phrase is not about, and state the remaining use.

This design follows A.6.P: recover the direct relation and actual participants when one obtains; add a reusable `RelationSignature` and declaration-local `SlotSpec`s only for typed reuse; keep assertion, specification, or view epistemes separate; and keep representation elements under C.29 with explicit correspondence. It also follows C.30: functional architecture is selected structure for a described holon, not a peer of architecture, not a selected transformation-flow structure by default, and not a mathematical graph description by itself.

The pattern keeps ordinary language usable. A phrase can remain Plain when it carries no FPF claim. When it carries an ontological, evidence, causal, assurance, bridge, gate, work, decision, or admissibility claim, the exact object or claim and direct owner are recoverable. No generic relation, claim, slot, or view record stands in for that result.

### A.6.F:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Practice or source line | A.6.F adoption | Action consequence | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 architecture-description discipline | Adapt view and concern discipline to functional architecture as a structure-kind view over an architecture claim. | Functional architecture expands through C.30 and C.30.ASV rather than becoming a separate ontology. | ISO terminology does not mint `U.Function` or turn diagrams into architecture. |
| OMG SysML v2 and KerML behavior and view practice | Adapt function, behavior, and model-view separation as practice source for functional-view recovery. | Functional views name selected functional structure and keep flow, module, and work relations separate. | SysML and KerML model elements do not override FPF kinds, relations, or governing patterns, and do not import tool ontology. |
| INCOSE systems-engineering and MBSE functional-analysis practice | Adopt the practical need to separate function, requirement, behavior, physical allocation, and verification claims. | A function-like phrase can guide architecture work only after capability or effect, allocation, evidence, and verification claims are separated. | Functional analysis practice is not evidence sufficiency, assurance, gate passage, or project decision by itself. |
| ISO/IEC 25010 quality-model practice | Treat functionality or functional suitability as quality wording when it evaluates a product or service. | Assign quality-like uses to C.25, C.16, or C.16.Q before they carry adequacy claims. | "Functionality" is not a free adequacy score and not an `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim or selected functional view. |
| C.29 mathematical-lens discipline | Adopt domain, codomain or relation-domain, preserved and lost structure, lens-use admissibility value, and stop condition for mathematical function use. | Mathematical function wording becomes lens-governed only when C.29 fields are recoverable. | Mathematical functions, objectives, and value functionals do not become holon purpose, evidence, causal proof, assurance, or decision claim by themselves. |
| GonzoML neural-network architecture discussions | Adapt practitioner operation language involving blocks, activations, path-selection, memory, cache, loss functions, pruning, ablation, and architecture search as recognition material. | Function-like neural-network wording must resolve to the exact mathematical object, flow relation, module-interface claim, capability or effect, quality characteristic, decision, or evidence claim and its direct owner. | Neural-network labels and benchmark results do not become FPF ontology, architecture decision, evidence sufficiency, gate passage, or assurance by themselves. |
