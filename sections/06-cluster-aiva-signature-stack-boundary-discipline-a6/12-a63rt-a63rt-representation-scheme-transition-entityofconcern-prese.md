## A.6.3.RT - Representation-Scheme Transition: EntityOfConcern-Preserving Representation-Scheme Transition

> **Type:** Specialization pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

### A.6.3.RT:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when practical content must survive a change of representation scheme or reasoning medium: prose to table, table to diagram, diagram to structured notation, a model to a different inspectable rendering, or another declared representation change. In plain language: **change the representation while preserving what matters for this use**.

Start with the content that must survive and the target representation that will make it more usable. Produce the target, compare it with the source, and state what was preserved, foregrounded, rearranged, lost, or newly suggested. Exact episteme identities are not prerequisites for this ordinary first result.

Plain starting vocabulary:

| Term | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `source material` | The source claims, table, prose, diagram, model, record, publication, or other material being re-represented. In an exact case, distinguish the source episteme from its form, carrier, world-side concern, and additional inputs. |
| `content to survive` | The claims, relations, commitments, uncertainty, source pins, or distinctions the target representation must still support for the declared use. |
| `target representation` | The table, diagram, notation, structured record, or other representation chosen for the receiving task. Its visible form or carrier does not by itself identify a receiving episteme. |
| `representation scheme` | The declared regime under which claim content is represented and interpreted for this use. |
| `reasoning medium` | What the representation lets a user inspect, compare, infer, traverse, or replay more or less easily. |
| `representation delta` | What changed in shape, notation, salience, topology, ordering, interaction, or another representation factor. |
| `loss and recoverability` | What becomes harder to see or is omitted, and how the user can recover it when it matters. |
| `use and return` | What the target supports, what it does not support, and when and where to return to source material. |
| `representation worker` | The person, team, or system doing the conversion. Recover the exact system-role assignment, method, and dated Work only when production history matters; doing the work grants no authority over the represented claims. |

**First useful move.** Name the content that must survive and the target representation; make the target; then attach a compact representation note: source material, intended user action, target representation and why, preserved content, representation/reasoning-medium delta, loss or unsupported additions, admissible and non-admissible use, and return trigger.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A cleaner table, diagram, notation, or decoded rendering is treated as harmless formatting after it has hidden uncertainty, changed the concern, imported a new relation, weakened recoverability, or invited a stronger action than the source supports.

**What this buys.** Users gain a representation suited to their task while preservation, reasoning affordances, loss, unsupported strengthening, and source return stay visible. The rendering does not thereby become knowledge, ontology, Work, `U.View`, publication authority, evidence, or assurance.

**Ordinary use.** For inspection, comparison, source-finding, technical discussion, or reversible planning preparation, the target representation and compact note are normally enough.

**Reliance-facing use.** Open the exact episteme-construction branch when the target must travel independently, be cited or disputed, cross a scheme boundary for consequential use, enter generated or decode-mediated admission, or satisfy a named public, evidence, or assurance receiver. Then recover exact source episteme `X`, receiving episteme `Y`, and viewing construction `v : X -> Y`, together with the source chain, scheme relation, loss/recoverability, evidence, or assurance actually needed for that use.

**Later-specific occurrence.** Open `RepresentationSchemeTransitionRelation@Context` only when actual representation-transformation Work and the exact six participants defined in §4.1.b are themselves material. An exact `v : X -> Y` does not imply that occurrence.

**Not this pattern when.** Use A.6.3.CR for same-regime wording, A.6.3.NAR when reader-useful narrative ordering is primary, E.17.EFP when explanation adequacy is primary, A.6.4 when the EntityOfConcern changes, A.7 for carrier or extraction work before a receiving episteme exists, and A.6.3.CSC when a narrower-use coarsened receiving episteme is primary.

### A.6.3.RT:2 - Problem

Without a dedicated representation-scheme-transition pattern:

1. teams treat text-to-table, table-to-diagram, and notation shifts as harmless formatting;
2. changes in reasoning medium and recoverability remain implicit;
3. a visible edge, row, geometry, or decoder output silently imports claims that the source did not make;
4. latent or distributed representations tempt users to treat feature geometry as ontology-by-default;
5. users cannot tell when the case has become retargeting, explanation, narrative ordering, carrier work, bridge use, or controlled coarsening; and
6. exact endpoint, occurrence, Work, publication, and assurance records are demanded before an ordinary useful target representation exists.

### A.6.3.RT:3 - Forces

- **Same concern, different reasoning medium.** Teams need representations suited to different tasks without silently changing what the claims concern.
- **Legibility vs recoverability.** A clearer target helps only if users can recover the source content and distinctions needed by the declared use.
- **Useful foregrounding vs unsupported strengthening.** Tables, diagrams, notation, and interactive views can expose structure while also making added links look source-given.
- **Representation change vs ontology change.** New notation or geometry can make structure visible; visibility does not establish world-side structure or a new EntityOfConcern.
- **Progressive exactness.** Ordinary conversions should stay easy, while externally relied-on or decode-mediated cases retain exact identity, source-chain, loss, and evidence discipline.
- **Recoverability before decode ambition.** Directly inspectable cases establish the normal entry; latent cases need explicit decoding access and evidence for their use.

### A.6.3.RT:4 - Solution — preserve practical content across a representation change

#### A.6.3.RT:4.1 - Ordinary representation move

Produce the useful target first:

1. Name the user action the new representation should help: compare, inspect, traverse, calculate, communicate, or replay.
2. Point to the source material and name the claims, relations, commitments, uncertainty, or source pins that must survive.
3. Choose the target representation and say why it is better suited to that action.
4. Produce the smallest target that supports the action.
5. Compare target and source. Mark what is preserved and foregrounded; what is rearranged, omitted, or harder to recover; and which visible links or interpretations were added by the representation.
6. State the representation and reasoning-medium delta only as far as it changes use or blocks a likely overread.
7. Close with admissible use, non-admissible use, and a concrete return trigger and destination.

Use this compact note for ordinary work:

| Representation note entry | Practical question |
| --- | --- |
| User action | What should the target make easier? |
| Source material | What will the user return to? |
| Content to survive | Which claims, relations, commitments, uncertainty, or pins matter? |
| Target and reason | Which representation is chosen, and why does it help? |
| Preserved/foregrounded | What remains recoverable, and what becomes easier to see? |
| Rearranged/lost/added | What is omitted or weakened, and which apparent relation is not source-given? |
| Use boundary | What may and may not be done with the target? |
| Return | Which condition sends the user back to the source or to a stronger claim's direct pattern? |

#### A.6.3.RT:4.1.a - Exact episteme-construction branch

Open this branch only when the receiving use makes exact claim identity material: independent travel or citation, disputed interpretation, consequential cross-scheme reuse, generated or decode-mediated admission, or a named public, evidence, or assurance receiver.

Then establish exact A.6.3 construction `v : X -> Y`:

1. identify source episteme `X` and receiving episteme `Y` independently under C.2.1 by claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme`;
2. require the same exact EntityOfConcern; a changed concern requires A.6.4;
3. state how claims in `X` and any named additional source epistemes construct the claims in `Y`;
4. state the relation between endpoint schemes, preserved and foregrounded content, admitted loss or recoverability, prohibited strengthening, applicability, use, and return; and
5. cite every exact correspondence relation on which `v` actually depends. Scheme difference, similar content, adjacency, or a visible edge proves none.

A source model, graph, publication occurrence, form, carrier, table, or display does not substitute for `X`; a target table, diagram, notation, page, or file does not substitute for `Y`. If the target has no recoverable claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, or effective reference scheme, keep it as a useful rendering or candidate carrier and do not assert exact RT yet.

An exact `v` performs no Work and is not a relation occurrence. A system may perform representation-transformation Work under A.15.1; methods, source-use relations, A.6.1 bindings, and any A.15.PROD inception claim remain separate. E.17.0 independently decides viewpoint conformance and dependent `U.View` membership. E.24.PUB independently identifies publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, and bounded use. Completing the exact construction does not itself authorize reliance.

#### A.6.3.RT:4.1.b - Later-specific six-participant occurrence

Use `RepresentationSchemeTransitionRelation@Context` only when the actual transition occurrence is itself needed and all six exact participants plus actual Work are present. The suffix `@Context` retrieves one independently selected A.1.1 `BoundedModelUseStructure : U.Structure`; it introduces no generic context kind or description-context field.

```text
RepresentationSchemeTransitionRelation@Context <: U.Relation:
  TransitionModelUseStructureSlot = <TransitionModelUseStructureSlot, U.Structure, U.StructureRef constrained to one exact BoundedModelUseStructure>
  PreservedEntityOfConcernSlot = <PreservedEntityOfConcernSlot, U.Entity, U.EntityRef>
  SourceRepresentationEpistemeSlot = <SourceRepresentationEpistemeSlot, U.Episteme, U.EpistemeRef>
  ReceivingRepresentationEpistemeSlot = <ReceivingRepresentationEpistemeSlot, U.Episteme, U.EpistemeRef>
  SourceRepresentationSchemeDescriptionSlot = <SourceRepresentationSchemeDescriptionSlot, U.Episteme, U.EpistemeRef>
  ReceivingRepresentationSchemeDescriptionSlot = <ReceivingRepresentationSchemeDescriptionSlot, U.Episteme, U.EpistemeRef>
  direction = SourceRepresentationEpistemeSlot -> ReceivingRepresentationEpistemeSlot
```

The six SlotSpecs and direction are the exact `RelationSignature`. `X` and `Y` have the same exact EntityOfConcern and their own effective schemes. Each scheme-description episteme is independently constituted: its claims describe one exact endpoint scheme, its EntityOfConcern is that scheme, and its own effective reference scheme makes the description interpretable. A scheme label or visible notation fills no scheme-description slot.

A positive occurrence obtains only when all of the following hold together:

1. all six participants resolve exactly, and the `BoundedModelUseStructure` was independently selected because its model-use organization changes this transition use;
2. A.13 identifies the actual performer, and A.15.1 independently admits the dated representation-transformation Work. If the current use also needs to say exactly which assignment covered that Work, F.6 checks that separate relation against the same A.13 assignment; F.6 identifies neither performer nor assignment, and a missing or failed attribution leaves the Work intact. The Work's governed inputs, result, references, or A.6.1 bindings use all six participant values;
3. exact `v : X -> Y` states claim construction, endpoint-scheme relation, same EntityOfConcern, preservation, loss or recoverability, prohibited strengthening, applicability, use, and return; and
4. every depended-on correspondence is an exact separately governed relation or claim.

Work, performer, assignment, method, operation application, source-use relations, and any inception claim are not seventh participants or identity discriminators. Work alone proves neither `v` nor the occurrence. Conversely, an inspectable `v` without the selected model-use structure and exact Work remains an ordinary exact construction.

The occurrence is participant-determined by the complete six-participant tuple. Changing any participant identifies another occurrence. A repeat Work episode, evidence change, publication, form, carrier, layout, transition-description edition, or C.29 output does not reidentify an unchanged tuple. A changed C.2.1 discriminator of `X` or `Y` first identifies another episteme and therefore another tuple.

#### A.6.3.RT:4.1.c - Transition description and source-relation epistemes

Describe the occurrence durably only after it obtains and a receiving use needs that description. The transition-description episteme is identified under C.2.1 by claim content about the exact six-participant occurrence, that occurrence as EntityOfConcern, and its own effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. Editing its claim graph creates another description episteme without changing the occurrence.

Its claim content may make these values recoverable; they are not extra participants or identity fields:

| Description content | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `transitionRelationRef` | The exact six-participant occurrence. |
| `viewingConstructionRefOrStatement` | Exact `v : X -> Y`, scheme relation, applicability, preservation, loss, and prohibited strengthening. |
| `representationTransformationWorkRef` | Exact A.15.1 Work already used in the obtaining test; performer, assignment, method, bindings, and inception remain separate. |
| `sourceRelationReferenceEpistemeRefs[]` | C.2.1 epistemes about exact source relations actually used; each relation still needs its own obtaining basis. |
| `preservedClaimRefs[]` | Exact source claims carried into `Y` for this use. |
| `preservedCommitmentRefs[]?` | Exact commitments preserved when a commitment is current. |
| `representationSchemeDeltaDescriptionRef` | What differs between the participating source- and receiving-scheme descriptions. |
| `reasoningMediumDeltaDescriptionRef?` | Changed inspection, comparison, inference, or replay affordance when material. |
| `representationLossDescriptionRef?` | Lost, narrowed, foregrounded, or rearranged distinctions. |
| `recoverabilityDescriptionRef?` | How omitted content is recovered from exact `X` or source relations. |
| `admissibleUseDescriptionRef` | What `Y` supports now. |
| `nonAdmissibleDownstreamUseDescriptionRef` | Which stronger use has not been established. |
| `returnConditionDescriptionRef` | When the user returns to exact `X` or its source relations. |

At least one of loss and recoverability is explicit; both are explicit when distinctions are lost and a recovery route is claimed.

When `v` cites a claim about one exact source relation, identify any reference-bearing episteme independently by its own C.2.1 triple: claims designating that relation and stating its exact kind, signature, defining pattern, and use in `v`; the source relation as EntityOfConcern; and its effective scheme. The episteme is not the relation, and citation does not make the relation obtain.

Publication may expose `X`, `Y`, the occurrence, or its description; forms, carriers, C.29 representations, and publication occurrences substitute for none of them.

#### A.6.3.RT:4.2 - Progressive use and local vocabulary

Use three levels, without copying one level's burden into another:

- **Ordinary target:** target representation plus compact note.
- **Exact construction:** add `X`, `Y`, `v`, endpoint schemes, exact source dependencies, and claim-level loss/return when the receiving use triggers them.
- **Actual transition occurrence:** add the six-participant relation, Work, and optional occurrence-description episteme only when that historical relation is itself material.

Use detailed vocabulary only when it changes the next representation decision or blocks a concrete overclaim:

- **semiotic mode** — the meaning-bearing relation doing the main work, such as structural likeness, trace, conventional code, model-mediated correspondence, or decode-mediated recovery;
- **factor delta** — the representation-factor change material to review;
- **source-relation chain** — the exact source claims and relations on which an exact `v` depends, or the ordinary source trail to which a user returns;
- **decode-mediated case** — a case whose receiving interpretation depends on a declared decoding or access relation;
- **actionability shift** — an apparent change in what users think they can do, which is not work authority, gate status, or permission; and
- **recoverability evidence** — evidence that omitted content can be recovered well enough for the declared use.

Do not create a local admissibility scale, source-relation status catalogue, publication-face requirement, or assurance lane merely because a representation changed. State the actual use, loss, evidence, and return once. Use A.10 or B.3 only when a specific evidence or assurance claim is current.

#### A.6.3.RT:4.3 - Direct and correspondence-mediated constructions

In a **direct** exact construction, `Y` is constructed from `X` and fixed declared configuration. State the claim rule, endpoint schemes, preserved content, loss, and applicability; no generic correspondence object is required.

In a **correspondence-mediated** exact construction, `Y` depends on additional source epistemes or governed relations among their claim-bearing contents. Recover each needed direct relation and, when `v` cites a claim about it, the exact C.2.1 assertion episteme. A correspondence table, model, graph edge, or scheme difference is neither the relation nor proof that it obtains.

Both profiles retain the same exact EntityOfConcern. Correspondence grants no retargeting, bridge, substitution, comparative-review, evidence, or publication licence. Add C.29 only for a current mathematical modeling or reasoning use.

#### A.6.3.RT:4.4 - Recurring moves and useful deltas

Recurring move shapes include tabulation, diagramming, structured-notation shift, and a same-EntityOfConcern correspondence-mediated representation shift. They are not separate Core patterns.

In ordinary language, say what changed and why it helps: “the table foregrounds row comparison”, “the diagram foregrounds dependency shape”, or “the notation foregrounds explicit argument positions”. Add salience, topology, actionability, calibration, interactivity, or semiotic-mode detail only when it materially changes use or misuse risk.

#### A.6.3.RT:4.5 - Preservation, loss, decode, and chains

##### A.6.3.RT:4.5.a - Preservation and conservativity

The ordinary move preserves the practical content named for the use. The exact branch preserves the same exact EntityOfConcern across independently constituted `X` and `Y` while changing scheme and often reasoning medium.

A target introduces a new concern-side claim when it:

- upgrades a source-visible relation into dependency theory or another relation not present in the source;
- turns geometry, notation, embedding proximity, or decoder output into ontology-by-default;
- adds bridge, substitution, comparative, mechanism, temporal, or control claims not licensed by source claims or an exact correspondence;
- collapses source alternatives, uncertainty, or bounded scope into one wider commitment; or
- treats decode-mediated recovery as direct givenness.

Check each target-side connective against the source or exact same-EntityOfConcern correspondence. Clearer, more structured, or more formal representation does not widen reliability.

##### A.6.3.RT:4.5.b - Loss and recoverability

State which distinctions, inspection possibilities, uncertainty cues, or local qualifiers are lost, foregrounded, rearranged, or harder to recover. The target may be useful with source-bounded reliability or an explicit downgrade. If it remains honest only through a narrower-use card and source return, A.6.3.CSC is primary.

##### A.6.3.RT:4.5.c - Decode-mediated entry

A latent or decode-mediated case stays bounded until it has source material for the same concern, a decoding or access relation, recoverability evidence for the intended use, admissible and non-admissible use, remaining user action, and source return. When exact reliance is claimed, source material includes exact `X`, exact `Y`, `v`, and the exact source-relation chain.

A latent region, activation pattern, embedding, probe result, decoded rendering, publication form, or carrier may help locate the case but fills no episteme endpoint. Missing recovery evidence keeps the result exploratory, report-only, or blocked.

##### A.6.3.RT:4.5.d - Composition and reopen rule

Repeated same-regime normalization may be idempotent; heterogeneous representation shifts are generally order-sensitive. Check a chain pairwise and carry accumulated loss instead of pretending each step resets it. Keep the source and target, content under test, scheme delta, preserved and withdrawn commitments, loss/recovery, and remaining action recoverable at every step.

Reopen the affected account when source content, endpoint identity, recovery assumptions, pins or provenance, correspondence or counter-witness disposition, primary semiotic mode, intended publication or receiving use, or accumulated loss changes. A changed EntityOfConcern requires A.6.4; a changed target-side claim uses the pattern that defines that exact claim.

#### A.6.3.RT:4.6 - Boundary triggers

| What became primary | Required move |
| --- | --- |
| Same-regime wording only | Use A.6.3.CR. |
| Reader-useful ordering into a narrative path | Use A.6.3.NAR; keep RT only for a remaining material scheme shift. |
| Explanation adequacy of an existing face | Use E.17.EFP. |
| Changed EntityOfConcern, ontology frame, or admissible predicate set | Use A.6.4 or the exact ontology pattern that defines the changed claim. |
| Carrier rendering, export, serialization, OCR, or parsing before a receiving episteme exists | Use A.7 or the corresponding carrier/extraction pattern. |
| A narrower-use coarsened receiving episteme | Use A.6.3.CSC with explicit loss and source return. |
| Cross-context equivalence, substitution, or bridge use | Keep RT for the representation delta and use the applicable F.9 relation for the bridge claim. |
| Bounded comparison over already available source epistemes | Use E.17.ID.CR; keep RT only for a remaining material representation change. |
| Problem formulation or abductive prompt, candidate, or selection | Use B.5.2.0 for the prompt and B.5.2 for the abductive loop. |
| Performed work, a work plan, or authority to act | Use the applicable A.15 pattern; an RT note or construction grants none. |
| Evidence or assurance force | Keep RT for preservation/loss and use A.10 or B.3 for that exact claim. |
| Temporal or dynamics claim | Use C.27 or A.3.3 for the claim actually made. |
| Transformation-flow graph/path, step-validity, or gate-decision claim | Use E.18, A.20, or A.21 respectively. |
| A contested mathematical lens | Keep RT for the representation transition and use C.29 only for adequacy of that lens. |

### A.6.3.RT:5 - Archetypal grounding

#### A.6.3.RT:5.1 - Ordinary same-concern text-to-table move

**Source slice.** `Service S showed three recurring latency spikes in the evening batch window. Trace T-44 and dashboard pin D-17 concern the same service and time window.`

**Target table.**

| Service | Window | Spike count | Source pins |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service S | Evening batch | 3 | T-44, D-17 |

The first result needs no endpoint dossier. The note says comparison across rows becomes easier; the service/window claim, count, and pins survive; prose order is lost; no causal or severity claim is added; use is inspection; and any qualifier or causal question returns to the source note and traces.

If the table is independently cited or disputed, exact source episteme `LatencyFinding-X` and receiving episteme `LatencyTable-Y` concern `Service-S-during-W` under effective schemes `ServiceTelemetryScheme-4` and `TabularTelemetryScheme-2`. `TabulateLatency : LatencyFinding-X -> LatencyTable-Y` records the exact construction, scheme relation, preservation, omission, prohibited strengthening, and inspection-only use. The visible table form and file carrier are not `Y`.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.2 - Positive later-specific table-to-diagram occurrence

Exact source episteme `CoolingLoopRelationTable-X` and exact receiving episteme `CoolingLoopDependencyDiagram-Y` state the same two connection claims about `CoolingLoop-7` under effective schemes `TabularPlantScheme-5` and `DirectedDiagramPlantScheme-3`. `Y` is a candidate episteme, not automatically a `U.View`.

Scheme-description epistemes `TabularPlantSchemeDescription-5` and `DirectedDiagramPlantSchemeDescription-3` concern their respective schemes and state their interpretation rules. Independently selected `CoolingLoopReviewModelUseStructure` satisfies A.1.1 because its model-use organization changes this review. System `PlantModelingTool-2`, under an exact system-role assignment, performs dated `CoolingLoopDiagrammingWork-18`; its bindings use all six participants. `DiagramCoolingLoop : X -> Y` states the exact claim rule, scheme relation, preserved connection claims, omitted table qualifiers, prohibited strengthening, and applicability.

Only then does this occurrence obtain:

```text
RepresentationSchemeTransitionRelation@Context(
  CoolingLoopReviewModelUseStructure,
  CoolingLoop-7,
  CoolingLoopRelationTable-X,
  CoolingLoopDependencyDiagram-Y,
  TabularPlantSchemeDescription-5,
  DirectedDiagramPlantSchemeDescription-3)
```

Its transition-description episteme cites the Work, construction, exact source relations, omitted qualifiers, topology-inspection use, blocked control-timing/work-order inference, and return to `X`. Rows become directed edges; pairwise lookup becomes topology inspection; each edge links back to its source-table relation. Publication, diagram form, and SVG carrier remain separate. `Y` is a `U.View` only if E.17.0 conformance independently obtains.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.2.a - Correspondence-mediated text-to-table shift

**Source prose.** `In the safety view, CL-2 maintains the required temperature condition during standard operating demand.`

**Target row.** `| Safety | CL-2 | required temperature condition during standard operating demand | CM-12 |`

The case stays RT only when exact `X`, exact `Y`, and `v : X -> Y` are identified for reliance-facing use, their EntityOfConcern is the same, and every relied-on correspondence is an exact governed occurrence. The visible row and correspondence record are not that relation.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.2.b - Same-concern diagram-to-structured-notation shift

**Source diagram.** `CoolingLoop -> Sensor A; CoolingLoop -> Valve B`

**Target notation.** `dependsOn(CoolingLoop, SensorA)` and `dependsOn(CoolingLoop, ValveB)`

This remains RT when the notation carries the same relation line and adds no dependency theory. If `dependsOn` has stronger semantics than the source arrows, that added claim must be removed or separately established.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.2.c - Functional-description diagram, table, or screen shift

A source description says that a mixing cell transfers liquid from Tank A through heat exchanger H-2 to reactor R-4, while keeping instrumentation and control claims outside. A target table foregrounds the transfer path. This remains RT only while the same functional slice is represented without adding performed-work order, module structure, evidence, gate passage, or control architecture.

Explanatory diagram order is not physical time or Work order unless the source states that temporal claim. OCR or parsing that merely extracts pixels, text, or layout starts with A.7. If the target becomes honest only by omitting exceptions, confidence bands, or source distinctions under a narrower use, use A.6.3.CSC.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.3 - Boundary to textual rewrite

A prose note is shortened, reordered, or translated but remains in the same textual regime. Use A.6.3.CR rather than inventing RT.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.4 - Boundary to explanation-facing rendering

A representation is changed mainly to teach or explain an existing face. E.17.EFP is primary; RT remains only for a separately material scheme transition.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.4.a - Boundary to bridge-bearing comparison

A local reliability note about Pump P-2 becomes a comparison claiming operational equivalence with Unit U-7 in another plant. That is not merely representation change. Keep any local representation delta in RT and establish the cross-context equivalence or substitution under the applicable F.9 relation.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.4.b - Boundary to carrier work

A table is exported as CSV and dashboard PNG after its representation scheme was chosen. The later activity is carrier formatting, export, packaging, or rendering Work, not another RT merely because the visible form changed.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.4.c - Boundary to coarsened dashboard view

An incident worksheet carries three causal branches, two confidence bands, and an open ambiguity; a dashboard tile foregrounds only cache-failover evidence. If the tile needs a narrower-use card, non-admissible action line, and explicit return to the worksheet, A.6.3.CSC is primary. The tile is not causal proof, service-status verdict, or action cue.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.4.d - Boundary to structure-to-narrative rendering

**Source structure.** `Architecture candidate C-2 has module split M, data-custody constraint D, placement constraint P, and unresolved latency versus maintainability trade-off T.`

**Narrative.** `The team first tried to preserve M, then found that D forced P, so C-2 accepts latency residual T to preserve maintainability.`

The main move is ordering selected structures into a reader path. Apply A.6.3.NAR for ordering, connective account, preservation/loss, use, and source return. Use RT only for a remaining representation-scheme shift that does not depend on that narrative ordering.

#### A.6.3.RT:5.5 - Guarded decode-mediated rendering

Probe run P-8 is tied to model-state log M-12 and evaluation bundle EV-4. A decoded rendering suggests a cluster corresponding to the same failure episode. The result remains exploratory and report-only until the decoding/access relation and recoverability evidence support that use. A latent region, feature cluster, probe result, source publication, or readable output fills no episteme endpoint.

### A.6.3.RT:6 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias | Countermove |
| --- | --- |
| Harmless-format bias | Compare source and target for reasoning affordances, loss, and added claims. |
| Formality-first bias | Produce the useful target and compact note before opening exact endpoints or an occurrence. |
| Ontology-by-notation bias | Treat geometry, rows, edges, embeddings, and decoder output as representations until an independent ontology claim is established. |
| Clarity-authority bias | Do not let a cleaner target widen evidence, reliability, assurance, gate, or work authority. |
| Decode-givenness bias | Require explicit decoding access and recoverability evidence for the declared use. |
| Object-collapse bias | Keep exact construction, relation occurrence, performed Work, occurrence-description episteme, publication, form, and carrier distinct. |

### A.6.3.RT:7 - Conformance and counterexample replay

#### A.6.3.RT:7.1 - Ordinary and exact checks

1. **CC-RT-1 — Useful ordinary entry.** A user can name content to survive, choose a target representation, produce it, and compare it with the source before supplying exact endpoint identities.
2. **CC-RT-2 — Same concern and right family.** The target still concerns the same thing; representation scheme or reasoning medium is the primary change rather than wording, narrative, explanation, carrier work, retargeting, bridge use, or controlled coarsening.
3. **CC-RT-3 — Delta and source comparison.** Preserved and foregrounded content, rearrangement, loss, recoverability, and apparent links not licensed by the source are visible.
4. **CC-RT-4 — Use and return.** Admissible and non-admissible use plus a practical source-return trigger are clear.
5. **CC-RT-5 — Progressive burden.** Detailed factors, semiotic mode, decode evidence, exact identities, Work, publication, evidence, and assurance appear only when each changes use or blocks a likely error.
6. **CC-RT-6 — Exact endpoints when triggered.** `X` and `Y` are independently constituted C.2.1 epistemes with the same exact EntityOfConcern and recoverable effective schemes; forms, carriers, models, displays, and readable output substitute for neither.
7. **CC-RT-7 — Exact construction.** `v : X -> Y` states the claim rule, endpoint-scheme relation, preservation, loss/recovery, prohibited strengthening, applicability, use, and return.
8. **CC-RT-8 — Exact dependencies and neighbors.** Correspondence dependencies obtain independently; C.29 representation, E.17.0 View membership, grounding, publication, evidence, assurance, bridge, gate, and receiving Work remain separate.
9. **CC-RT-9 — Later-specific occurrence only at its trigger.** A positive `RepresentationSchemeTransitionRelation@Context` has the exact A.1.1 model-use structure, preserved concern, `X`, `Y`, two exact scheme-description epistemes, and actual Work satisfying §4.1.b.
10. **CC-RT-10 — Occurrence, Work, and description stay distinct.** The participant tuple identifies the occurrence; Work and production claims remain separate; the transition-description episteme has the occurrence as EntityOfConcern and its own C.2.1 identity.
11. **CC-RT-11 — Occurrence identity.** Only a changed participant reidentifies the occurrence; repeat Work, evidence, publication, layout, carrier, description edition, or C.29 output does not.
12. **CC-RT-12 — Reuse is local.** Reopen or lower only the affected source/target, delta, dependency, loss, use, evidence, or return when it changes.

#### A.6.3.RT:7.2 - Counterexample replay

| Case | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary entry | A service note can become a useful comparison table and loss note without first inventing `X`, `Y`, `v`, Work, publication, or assurance records. |
| Preserve vs retarget | Exact RT requires equal EntityOfConcern; a changed concern requires A.6.4 even when labels overlap. |
| Same scheme | If scheme and reasoning medium are unchanged and only wording changes, use A.6.3.CR. |
| Different scheme | Scheme difference alone establishes neither `v`, correspondence, Work, Bridge, nor the six-participant occurrence. |
| Candidate vs `U.View` | A valid receiving episteme and RT construction may fail E.17.0 conformance and remain a non-View candidate. |
| Publication/form/carrier | Availability, form change, or carrier replacement substitutes for no endpoint and reidentifies no unchanged construction or occurrence. |
| Work without conservativity | A system may produce `Y`, yet unsupported strengthening or hidden loss blocks the exact construction and occurrence. |
| Grounded source, ungrounded receiver | Grounding of `X` does not transfer through `v`; `Y` has an `EpistemeEmpiricalGroundingRelation` only when its own covered claims and conditions make one obtain. |
| Readable decode without recovery basis | Keep a fluent decoded output exploratory, report-only, or blocked until the same-concern source, a declared decoding or access relation, recoverability evidence for the intended use, non-admissible use, remaining user action, and return are present. Readability, probe score, feature geometry, or publication form fills no episteme endpoint. |
| Selected structure overread | The exact `BoundedModelUseStructure` is one participant only in the triggered occurrence; it is not transformer, viewpoint, `U.View`, representation, publication, or EntityOfConcern. |
| Cross-scheme dependency | Scheme difference, similar content, a description, or C.29 output cannot replace the exact transition or F.9 Bridge and bounded-use relation required by that dependency. |
| Description or C.29 output | Editing the transition description or mathematical output does not change the occurrence unless an exact participant changes. |

### A.6.3.RT:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Repair move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endpoint dossier before target | Ordinary work stalls before a useful table, diagram, or notation exists. | Produce the target and source comparison first; open exact identities only at a named receiving-use trigger. |
| Every format shift is harmless | Representation changes alter inspection, salience, and recoverability. | State the practical representation/reasoning delta and compare source with target. |
| Scheme, semiotic mode, and viewpoint collapsed | Users cannot tell what changed or which claim needs review. | Name only the distinction that changes use, and keep viewpoint under E.17.0 when it is current. |
| Notation becomes ontology | Geometry or notation appears to define the world. | Point every target-side relation back to source claims or establish the new ontology claim separately. |
| Occurrence description treated as occurrence | A changed description, publication, layout, or carrier appears to change relation identity. | Keep six-participant identity on the occurrence and identify the description under C.2.1. |
| Retargeting hidden as representation | A changed EntityOfConcern is mislabeled as same-concern conversion. | Use A.6.4 when the concern changes. |
| Latent case first | Decode demands overwhelm the ordinary representation task. | Keep latent use exploratory until decoding access and recovery evidence are explicit. |

### A.6.3.RT:9 - Consequences

- Ordinary users can obtain a useful target representation without a six-participant record.
- Representation and reasoning-medium changes become explicit rather than rhetorical.
- Exact same-EntityOfConcern, scheme, source-chain, loss, and occurrence identity remain available for consequential use.
- Recoverability and decode dependence become reviewable instead of hiding behind cleaner output.
- Work, View membership, publication, evidence, assurance, bridge, and ontology claims remain separate.

Costs and trade-offs:

- Authors must compare source and target instead of judging only appearance.
- Reliance-facing use adds exact identity and evidence work proportionate to the receiver.
- Some attractive targets remain orientation-only or exploratory because source return or recovery is weak.

### A.6.3.RT:10 - Rationale

Representation changes are neither always cosmetic nor always new ontology. The reusable move is to preserve practical content for a use, expose the changed reasoning medium, and keep loss and return honest. Exact `v : X -> Y` is the stronger claim-level description when needed; the six-participant occurrence is later-specific evidence about actual transition Work, not the entrance fee for changing prose into a table.

These sources support different domains; none contributes a new FPF kind. Their common lesson is practical: a changed representation can change what users see and infer, while clarity, notation, geometry, or decoded prose supplies no ontology, evidence force, gate status, or work authority by itself.

**Explicit non-source.** `SysML 2.0` is intentionally excluded from RT's SoTA basis and is not retained as lineage for this practice question. Standardization, search prominence, a systems-oriented name, and prospective transformation claims do not supply evidence of a current problem-solving advance in semantics-preserving representation work; for this selection it is a historical dead end. Do not reintroduce it merely because it appears early in a web search or carries official status.

### A.6.3.RT:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `A.6.3` and `A.6.2` for effect-free source-to-receiving construction; C.2.1 for exact endpoint and description identity; A.1.1 and A.15.1 only for the later-specific occurrence; C.2.7 and E.10.D2 when representation factors or semiotic mode are material.
- **Coordinates with:** A.6.3.CR, A.6.3.NAR, A.6.3.CSC, E.17.EFP, E.17.ID.CR, A.6.4, A.7, F.9, B.5.2.0, B.5.2, A.15, E.18, A.20, A.21, A.10, B.3, C.27, A.3.3, C.26, and C.29 at the specific boundaries named above.
- **Keeps separate:** actual Work and method; E.17.0 View membership; E.24.PUB publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, and use; grounding; bridge; evidence; assurance; gate; temporal, dynamics, and transformation-flow claims.
- **Boundary:** RT contributes preservation, representation/reasoning delta, loss/recovery, use, and return. It does not let a table, diagram, notation, model display, decoded output, publication, form, or carrier substitute for an exact episteme or authorize a stronger claim.

### A.6.3.RT:12a - Boundary with quantum-like state-representation shortcuts

Use RT when the primary move is the same-concern shift from one state representation to another: state vector to typed description, fuller model to quantized record, or one notation to another. Start with the ordinary representation note: content to survive, shortcut representation, loss, use, and return.

Add the following only when the shortcut's claim requires it:

1. source and receiving schemes and the same EntityOfConcern;
2. representation-factor, reasoning-medium, salience, topology, actionability, calibration, or interaction delta that matters;
3. decoding relation and recovery evidence;
4. causal- or approximate-causal-abstraction mapping when action, intervention, manipulation, or cross-abstraction structure is claimed; and
5. the exact C.26 cue and bounded use when a quantum-like state-representation claim is actually current.

| Ordinary shortcut note | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Source and content | Which fuller representation or evidence set carries the distinctions? |
| Shortcut | Which cheaper, typed, quantized, symbolic, or lower-detail representation is used? |
| Loss | Which precision, expressivity, compatibility, recovery, or evidence relation is not carried? |
| Admissible use | Which decision, explanation, triage, comparison, or action-selection move remains supported? |
| Return | Which dispute, stronger-use demand, evidence gap, or recovery failure returns to the fuller representation? |

Use a fuller C.26 record only when the shortcut is reusable, formal, empirical, high-stakes, or tied to comparative performance or tractability. Do not describe ordinary compression, low-bit implementation, diagramming, or representation learning as quantum-like without a claim-bearing formal cue.

### A.6.3.RT:12b - C.29 mathematical-lens use relation

When RT imports a contested or claim-bearing mathematical lens, RT still carries source/target schemes, same-EntityOfConcern construction, preservation, loss, and return. Cite the applicable C.29 output only for adequacy of that mathematical lens. C.29 neither replaces the RT account nor broadens it into bridge, evidence, or causal authority.
