## A.6.M - Module Relation Repair

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### A.6.M:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when an architecture or engineering text says "module", "component", "interface", "port", "platform", or "open architecture", and the phrase is doing more than ordinary orientation. If a stratification or architecture-operation source label covered by `C.30.STRAT` is doing the work, apply `C.30.STRAT` first; use A.6.M only when that repair recovers a module-interface relation. Use A.6.M when the question under repair is whether one holon is being treated as a replaceable, reusable, or separately changed structural unit of a larger holon under a declared module-interface viewpoint.

The first useful move is `ModuleRelationRepairNote`:

```text
ModuleRelationRepairNote:
  wholeHolonRef:
  candidateModuleHolonRef:
  boundedContextRef:
  moduleInterfaceViewpointRef: VP.ModuleInterface
  boundaryRef:
  interfaceSpecificationRef or interfaceSpecificationGap:
  admissibilityConditions:
  substitutabilityPolicyRef?:
  changePolicyRef?:
  claimBoundary:
  notAModuleBecause:
  governedNonModuleClaimPatternRefs:
  stopCondition:
```

Ordinary use stops when the whole, candidate module, boundary, interface specification, admissibility conditions, substitutability policy, change policy, blocked false interpretation, and neighboring work, procedural, role, or enactor governing pattern choice are clear enough to choose the next architecture move. Use the fuller `moduleIn(...)` relation record only when the claim being made involves substitutability, conformance, publication, evidence, assurance, change policy, repeated reuse, or cross-team coordination.

What goes wrong if A.6.M is missed: a functional link becomes a module interface; a signature becomes an implemented interface; a port label becomes proof of integration; "open" becomes a decoration; a platform label hides the actual extension rules; a stratification or architecture-operation source label bypasses `C.30.STRAT` and mints a false local kind; autonomy-like wording is confused with separate module change policy; and a module diagram starts being used for claims governed elsewhere.

What A.6.M buys in practice: the practitioner can repair one module or interface phrase into a module-relation record, see which FPF pattern governs any remaining non-module claim, and stop before full measurement, evidence, or mechanism-suite records are needed.

Not this pattern when the question under repair is the general architecture claim, selected architecture structure kind, structural view, stratification wording or source-label recovery, function wording, procedural or work-package wording, role or enactor wording, autonomous operation, independent acting, unsupervised decision or action, measurement, modularity characterization, or reusable-structure residue. Use `C.30`, `C.30.ASV`, `C.30.STRAT`, `A.6.F`, `A.15`, `A.2`, `E.16`, `C.31`, `C.16`, or `C.31.RSA` as appropriate. For any other claim being made, apply the governing FPF pattern and keep A.6.M only for the module-relation and interface-specification portion.

**E.10.ARCH relation.** A.6.M is the precision-restoration pattern for module-interface relation wording, interface-specification wording, platform-grammar wording, substitutability wording, change-policy wording, and open-architecture module-interface claims. `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, or `C.30.STRAT` applies A.6.M only after the recovered result is a module-interface relation, interface specification, platform grammar, substitutability policy, change policy, or open-architecture module-interface claim. If the source wording is still a stratification or architecture-operation source label covered by `C.30.STRAT`, apply `C.30.STRAT` first. If the claim being made is non-module work, role, evidence, assurance, gate, decision, characteristic, flow, autonomy, component, mechanism, or mathematical-lens use, apply the governing pattern named in `A.6.M:12` and keep A.6.M only for the module-interface slice when that module-interface relation remains the claim being made.

### A.6.M:2 - Problem

Engineering teams use module language for several different things:

- a component in a part-whole decomposition;
- a replaceable unit under a declared interface;
- a functional element;
- a software package, neural-network block, hardware board, chiplet, subsystem, service, team boundary, or delivery unit;
- a published API, protocol, signature, port, connector, or endpoint;
- a platform extension point;
- a control relation, deployment scope, or stratification or architecture-operation source label that still needs `C.30.STRAT` recovery;
- an open-architecture claim.

These are useful ordinary words, but they do not establish the same FPF claim. A module claim is not created by a label. A conforming module-interface claim states how a candidate `U.Holon` relates to a larger `U.Holon` under `VP.ModuleInterface`: boundary, interface specification, admissibility conditions, substitutability policy when replacement is claimed, change policy when separate change is claimed, and any evidence, conformance, or admissible-use expectation being claimed.

The practical question is: does this phrase name a module relation, a component relation, a functional allocation, a procedural or work-package relation, a role or enactor relation, a deployment or placement structure, an interface specification, a signature declaration, a port or endpoint slot, a transformation-flow crossing, a mechanism realization, a platform grammar, a control relation, an autonomy-like operation claim, a source label governed first by `C.30.STRAT`, or only plain source wording?

### A.6.M:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Engineering convenience vs relation precision | Practitioners need short words such as module and interface, but claim-bearing use must recover relation kind, slots, boundary, and admissible use. |
| Module role vs root kind | A module is often a holon in a module-interface role; minting `U.Module` would hide context, viewpoint, and relation conditions. |
| Interface label vs interface specification | An API name, port label, connector label, or signature may substantiate an interface claim, but it is not by itself substitutability or conformance. |
| Function-flow-module proximity vs false identity | Functions, E.18 flow relations, control relations, mechanisms, and module interfaces often meet at the same artifact, but each has a different governing pattern. |
| Open architecture payoff vs open label overread | MOSA and open-system practice make open interfaces useful only with standards, conformance expectations, replacement or change policy, and data or access constraints when those conditions are part of the claim being made. |
| Team boundary vs module boundary | Conway's law and mirroring practice make team communication boundaries and delivery-responsibility scopes architecture-relevant, but they do not turn a team boundary, delivery unit, role assignment, or role and enactor relation into a module interface by identity. |
| Parallel decomposition vs serial bottleneck | Amdahl-style reasoning makes serial work, synchronization, communication overhead, and shared resource limits visible; more modules, teams, or parallel paths do not automatically improve throughput or evolvability. |
| Cheap repair vs full evidence pack | Most cases need a relation repair note, not a full conformance, evidence, assurance, gate, or mechanism-suite record. |

### A.6.M:4 - Solution

A.6.M specializes `A.6.P` for module, component, interface, platform, and open-architecture wording when the recovered result is a module-interface relation, interface specification, platform grammar, substitutability relation, or open-architecture module-interface claim. Stratification or architecture-operation source labels covered by `C.30.STRAT` are governed by `C.30.STRAT` until that repair recovers a module-interface relation; A.6.M applies only to that recovered module-interface result. A.6.M does not mint root kinds from those source labels.

A module is a `U.Holon` viewed in a declared bounded context as a replaceable, reusable, or separately changed structural unit of a larger `U.Holon` under `VP.ModuleInterface`, with explicit boundary, interface specification, admissibility conditions, substitutability policy when replaceability is claimed, and change policy when separate change is claimed. A functional element is different: `FunctionalElement@Context` is a view-local functional-structure record inside `FunctionalStructureView@Context`, not a root kind and not a module-interface value. It binds required behavior to bearer, capability, functional ports, and allocation when those claims are current. The relation between functional element and module is allocation or correspondence by default, not identity. One module can realize many functional elements; many modules can realize one functional element; a functional element can be abstract before allocation; and a module can be present in a module-interface view with no current functional behavior in the functional view.

Functional ports and module interfaces may both use `U.Signature` discipline, but they govern different claims. A functional port constrains input condition, output condition, accepted-state, and produced-state slots for a functional behavior or transformation. A module interface constrains boundary, substitutability, compatibility, protocol references, schema references, version policy, change policy, and conformance expectations for a module relation. Do not move a functional-port claim into module-interface structure unless a module-interface or substitution claim is actually being made.

For modular synthesis, A.6.M supplies only the module-interface slice. A synthesis move may align required functions or functional-service claims under `VP.Functional`, transformation-flow topology under `E.18` and `C.30.TFS-REL`, control structure under `C.30.LCA`, procedures and work packages under `VP.Procedural`, role enactors under `VP.RoleEnactor`, and modules or interfaces under `VP.ModuleInterface`; A.6.M repairs the module-interface relation, while non-module candidate generation, evidence, assurance, decision, work, and characteristic claims are governed by the patterns named in `A.6.M:12` when those claims are being made.

#### A.6.M:4.1 - `moduleIn(...)` relation record
Use `moduleIn(...)` only when the light repair note is not enough:

```text
moduleIn(
  moduleHolonRef: U.HolonRef,
  wholeHolonRef: U.HolonRef,
  boundedContextRef: U.BoundedContextRef,
  viewpointRef: U.ViewpointRef = VP.ModuleInterface,
  boundaryRef: BoundaryRef,
  interfaceSpecRef: InterfaceSpecificationRef,
  functionalCorrespondenceRefs?: FinSet(CorrespondenceRef | KindBridgeRef),
  transformationFlowRelationRefs?: FinSet(PathSliceId | TransferRef | CrossingRef),
  mechanismRefs?: FinSet(MechanismRef),
  dependencyRefs?: FinSet(QualifiedRelationRecordRef),
  substitutabilityPolicyRef?: EpistemeRef,
  changePolicyRef?: EpistemeRef,
  variabilitySlotRefs?: FinSet(SlotRef),
  evidencePathRefs?: FinSet(EvidencePathRef),
  admissibleUse,
  nonAdmissibleUse
)
```

Well-formedness: the relation names both holons, one bounded context, one module-interface viewpoint, one boundary, and an interface specification or explicit interface-specification gap. Optional evidence, mechanism, and policy fields are used only when the corresponding evidence, mechanism, policy, conformance, or reliance claim is being made.

#### A.6.M:4.2 - Interface specification is not a label

`InterfaceSpecificationRef` is the local specification reference for an interface specification. It may include:

```text
InterfaceSpecificationRef:
  signatureRefs?: FinSet(SignatureRef)
  slotSpecSetRefs?: FinSet(SlotSpecSetRef)
  portEndpointSpecRefs?: FinSet(PortEndpointSpecRef)
  protocolRefs?: FinSet(EpistemeRef)
  schemaRefs?: FinSet(EpistemeRef)
  admissibilityConditions:
  semanticConditions:
  versionPolicyRef?:
  changePolicyRef?:
  conformanceExpectationRefs?:
  evidencePathRefs?:
  nonAdmissibleUse:
```

A signature declares vocabulary, laws, and applicability. A slot or endpoint record names positions and field structure. A protocol or schema constrains interaction. A mechanism reference can substantiate a realization relation. Evidence paths and conformance expectations can substantiate reliance only when an evidence path named by value or an assurance claim is being made. None of these, alone, is the module interface.

#### A.6.M:4.3 - Repair applications for overloaded words

| Source wording | Governing repair application |
| --- | --- |
| `component` | First recover an `A.14` relation such as `ComponentOf`, `ConstituentOf`, `PortionOf`, `MemberOf`, or `PhaseOf`. Apply A.6.M only when a module-interface relation is being claimed. |
| `module` | Recover `moduleIn(...)` or `ModuleRelationRepairNote` over `U.Holon` refs under `VP.ModuleInterface`. |
| `functional element` | Keep as `FunctionalElement@Context` inside `FunctionalStructureView@Context`; use `A.6.F` to repair wording and connect to module-interface structure only through correspondence or allocation. Allow many-to-many allocation: one module may realize many functional elements, many modules may realize one functional element, a functional element may be abstract before allocation, and a module may have no current functional behavior in the view. |
| `work package`, `delivery unit`, or `team boundary` | Keep work, method, work-plan, role-assignment, role, and enactor claims with `A.15`, `A.2`, `VP.Procedural`, or `VP.RoleEnactor` when the wording asserts those claim kinds. Relate them to module-interface structure only through declared correspondence, allocation, or boundary relation. |
| `deployment scope` or `placement` | Recover a deployment or placement structure under `C.30` or `C.30.ASV` when that deployment or placement structure is being claimed. Relate it to module-interface structure only through declared correspondence or boundary relation. |
| `interface` | Recover `InterfaceSpecificationRef`, not a wire, API label, port label, E.18 transformation-flow relation, or function by itself. |
| `signature` | Keep as A.6.0 declaration. It is not an implemented interface, mechanism, gate, evidence row, or substitution policy. |
| `port` or `endpoint` | Recover `SlotSpec`, endpoint field, or interface-specification field when the claim is being made. It is not a module, graph edge, transformation-flow crossing, or proof of integration. |
| `functional link` | Keep under `VP.Functional` or `FunctionalStructureView@Context`; relate to modules only through declared correspondence, allocation, or retargeting. |
| `E.18 transformation-flow relation` or `path` | Keep under `E.18` and `C.30.TFS-REL`; it may inform an architecture-to-transformation-flow relation, but it is not an interface specification. |
| `platform` | Recover `PlatformGrammarRef`: extension rules, variability slots, interface specifications, substitution policy, and conformance expectations when platform extension, variation, substitution, or conformance use is being claimed. |
| stratification or architecture-operation source label | Apply `C.30.STRAT` first. Use A.6.M only when the recovered result is a module-interface relation, interface specification, platform grammar, substitutability policy, change policy, or open-architecture module-interface claim. Otherwise apply `C.30.LCA`, `C.30.ASV`, `A.6.F`, `E.18`, `C.16.P`, `C.29`, `C.2.P`, or use ordinary source-label disposition when no FPF-governed claim remains. |
| `open architecture` | Recover `OpenArchitectureClaim@Context`: published interface specifications, substitution rules, change policy, data-rights or access constraints when those constraints are part of the open-architecture claim, and conformance expectations or evidence paths when reliance is being claimed. |

#### A.6.M:4.4 - First repair sequence

1. Name the phrase and the practical situation.
2. Select the whole holon and candidate module holon.
3. State whether the source phrase is module relation, component relation, function allocation, procedural or work-package relation, role or enactor relation, deployment or placement structure, interface specification, signature, port or endpoint, transformation-flow crossing, mechanism realization, platform grammar, control relation, autonomy-like operation claim, `C.30.STRAT` source-label case, or open-architecture claim.
4. State the boundary and the declared interface specification or explicit interface-specification gap.
5. State the admissibility conditions, substitutability policy, and change policy, or mark any of those fields not established by the repair.
6. State the governing pattern for any non-module claim being made: `C.30`, `C.30.ASV`, `A.6.F`, `A.15`, `A.2`, `E.18`, `C.30.TFS-REL`, `C.31`, `C.31.RSA`, `C.16`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `C.28`, `E.20`, `G.5`, or `C.11`.
7. Stop when the relation and next move are explicit.

#### A.6.M:4.5 - Worked slices

**Ports line up.**

```text
Phrase:
  "The ports line up, so the modules are compatible."

ModuleRelationRepairNote:
  wholeHolonRef: VehicleControlSystem
  candidateModuleHolonRef: BrakeControllerPackage
  boundedContextRef: Release-2026Q2
  boundaryRef: BrakeControlBoundary
  interfaceSpecificationRef or gap: endpoint names present; protocol and semantic conditions missing
  admissibilityConditions: not yet declared
  substitutabilityPolicyRef: missing
  changePolicyRef: missing
  claimBoundary: interface-spec repair; no evidence or gate claim yet
  notAModuleBecause: port labels alone do not establish implemented interface compatibility
  governedNonModuleClaimPatternRefs: A.6.5, A.6.B, then A.6.M only if a substitution claim remains
  stopCondition: endpoint slots and missing interface-spec fields are visible
```

**Open platform claim.**

```text
Phrase:
  "This is an open platform."

OpenArchitectureClaim@Context:
  architectureClaimRef:
  platformGrammarRef:
  interfaceSpecificationRefs:
  variabilitySlotRefs:
  substitutabilityPolicyRef:
  changePolicyRef:
  conformanceExpectationRefs:
  evidencePathRefs?:
  nonAdmissibleUse:
    "open" does not by itself prove substitutability, interoperability,
    assurance, procurement suitability, or architecture quality
```

The first slice repairs the claim without requiring measurement. The second slice applies MOSA-like conformance expectations and substitution policy only for the conformance or substitution claim being made.

Supplier-diversity, procurement suitability, use-context compatibility, business constraint, policy authorization, and provider-selection claims are not module-interface fields. If those claims are being made, A.6.M names only the module-interface slice; non-module selection, procurement, work, role, evidence, assurance, gate, release, and mechanism claims are governed by the patterns named in `A.6.M:12`.

**Team boundary claim.**
```text
Phrase:
  "The team communication boundary matches the module boundary."

ModuleRelationRepairNote:
  wholeHolonRef: PaymentsPlatform
  candidateModuleHolonRef: SettlementService
  boundedContextRef: ProductLine-2026Q2
  boundaryRef: SettlementServiceBoundary
  interfaceSpecificationRef or gap: service API exists; semantic versioning, data schema, and semantic-constraint conditions incomplete
  admissibilityConditions: team delivery responsibility and on-call responsibility declared; substitutability not established
  substitutabilityPolicyRef: missing
  changePolicyRef: missing
  claimBoundary: role, enactor, work, and procedural correspondence first; module-interface relation only after boundary and interface specification are declared
  notAModuleBecause: team communication boundary and delivery responsibility do not by themselves establish module interface, substitutability, or compatibility
  governedNonModuleClaimPatternRefs: A.15 and A.2 for team and work claims; C.29 if the team-to-module correspondence is claimed as homomorphism-like or almost-same structure; A.6.M only for the declared module-interface relation
  stopCondition: the correspondence is usable as an architecture diagnostic, not as proof
```

The third slice uses Conway-like mirroring as a diagnostic prompt. It does not make organization structure, communication relations, or delivery responsibility into module-interface structure by identity.

Proxy-cost replay: if a repair proposes more modules, more open interfaces, or more parallel paths, name what may get worse before claiming improvement. Synchronization work, communication overhead, conformance work, shared-resource pressure, hidden exception cost, or cross-boundary change cost can become the claim being made. A.6.M repairs only the module-interface relation; speedup, bottleneck, modularity, measurement, work, and quality tradeoffs are governed by `C.29`, `E.18`, `C.31`, `C.16`, `A.15`, or the related governing pattern named by value when that related claim is being made.

#### A.6.M:4.6 - Lowering and Reopen Conditions

Lower an A.6.M repair to reduced-use cue, quote-only wording, blocked use, or incomplete rewrite when the module-interface relation, interface specification, admissibility conditions, substitutability policy, or change policy cannot be stated by value.

Reopen the repair when any of these change: the whole holon, candidate module holon, boundary, interface specification, explicit interface gap, substitutability policy, change policy, platform grammar, conformance expectation, evidence path relied on, source-label recovery from `C.30.STRAT`, team-boundary correspondence, work correspondence, or the governing pattern for a related claim being made.

If the reopened material is no longer a module-interface relation, A.6.M keeps only the previous repair as source context and the claim being made is governed by the pattern named in `A.6.M:12`.

### A.6.M:5 - Archetypal Grounding

**Tell.** A module is not a little box. It is a holon related to a larger holon under a declared boundary, interface specification, admissibility conditions, substitutability policy, and change policy.

**Show.** A software package, neural-network block, chiplet, power converter, document template, or organizational unit can become module-like in a project only when the relation record says what whole it belongs to, what boundary it offers, what interface specification governs use, what substitutability policy makes replacement admissible, and what change policy governs separate change.

**Show.** A port label, API endpoint or route label, flow edge, or function name may be a useful clue. It can substantiate a module-interface claim only after the relevant signature, slot, protocol, semantic condition, correspondence, mechanism, and evidence, conformance, source relation, or reliance relation named by value are declared.

Holon and episteme: the candidate module and whole are described holons under a module relation; they may be systems, epistemes, methods, organizations, publication families, or other structured holons. The module relation, interface specification, platform grammar, and open-architecture claim are Description epistemes, specification-use descriptions, or relation records about those holons. Stratification and architecture-operation labels named by `C.30.STRAT` remain source labels unless `C.30.STRAT` recovers a module-interface relation that A.6.M can use.

### A.6.M:6 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias risk | A.6.M repair |
| --- | --- |
| Box bias | Do not treat a diagram box as a module. Recover holon, whole, boundary, and interface specification. |
| Open-label bias | Do not treat "open" as substitutability. Recover standards, conformance expectations, data or access constraints, and change policy when those conditions are part of the claim being made. |
| Component bias | Do not treat every part as a module. Apply A.14 to component wording unless a module-interface relation is being claimed. |
| Interface-label bias | Do not treat API, port, endpoint, or signature labels as implemented compatibility. Recover `InterfaceSpecificationRef`. |
| Team-boundary bias | Do not treat Conway-like mirroring, team responsibility, team communication boundary, or delivery-unit labels as module boundaries. Recover role, enactor, work, and procedural relations first; add module-interface correspondence only when the boundary and interface specification are declared. |
| Parallelism bias | Do not treat decomposition into more modules, teams, services, or paths as performance or evolvability improvement. Recover serial work, synchronization, communication overhead, shared resources, and bottleneck claims through `E.18`, `C.30.TFS-REL`, C.29, C.31, or neighboring characteristic patterns when those claims are being made. |
| Platform bias | Do not treat a platform name as architecture quality. Recover platform grammar and the claim named by value it can substantiate. |

### A.6.M:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-A6M-1` | The text names the whole holon, candidate module holon, bounded context, and module-interface viewpoint, or explicitly stops at ordinary non-claim-bearing wording. |
| `CC-A6M-2` | The repair states whether the phrase is a module relation, component relation, function allocation, procedural or work-package relation, role or enactor relation, deployment or placement structure, interface specification, signature, port or endpoint, transformation-flow crossing, mechanism realization, platform grammar, control relation, autonomy-like operation claim, `C.30.STRAT` source-label case, or open-architecture claim. |
| `CC-A6M-3` | No new root kind is minted for module, interface, platform, or open architecture; stratification or architecture-operation source labels use `C.30.STRAT` unless a module-interface relation has already been recovered. |
| `CC-A6M-4` | `InterfaceSpecificationRef` is recoverable when interface compatibility, substitutability, or conformance is being claimed. |
| `CC-A6M-5` | Substitution or change policy is declared when replaceability, alternate supplier, upgrade, or platform extension is being claimed. Substitutability not established by the repair is marked as not established, not implied by wording. |
| `CC-A6M-6` | Function, transformation-flow, control, work, evidence, assurance, gate, decision, causal, and mechanism claims use their governing patterns. |
| `CC-A6M-7` | A failed check gives a repair move or governing-pattern application, not only a rejection. |
| `CC-A6M-8` | A current `G.2` source row for MOSA, open systems, platform practice, Conway correspondence, team-boundary correspondence, or Amdahl-style decomposition limits appears before guidance from that source is used for practitioner-facing claims being made. |
| `CC-A6M-9` | RFC keywords are used only for pattern users, records, claims, conformance items, or publication records, evidence records, or assurance records. Modeled modules and interfaces are not written as agents with duties. |
| `CC-A6M-10` | Lower or reopen the repair when whole holon, module holon, boundary, interface specification, interface gap, substitutability policy, change policy, platform grammar, conformance expectation, relied-on evidence path, source-label recovery, team-to-work correspondence, or neighboring governing pattern changes. |

### A.6.M:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BoxIsModule` | A diagram box is treated as a module. | Recover `moduleIn(...)` fields or downgrade the box to a publication face or structural view element. |
| `SignatureAsInterface` | A signature declaration is treated as implemented compatibility. | Keep signature under A.6.0 and add interface-specification fields only when interface compatibility is being claimed. |
| `PortAsProof` | Matching port or endpoint names are treated as integration proof. | Recover slot specs, protocol or schema, semantic conditions, and evidence, conformance, source relation, or reliance relation named by value. |
| `FunctionalLinkAsInterface` | A functional relation is treated as module boundary. | Keep `VP.Functional` and add correspondence or allocation only when module allocation or correspondence is being claimed. |
| `OpenByPublicationOnly` | Published interface text is treated as open architecture. | Add substitution policy, conformance expectations, change policy, source or evidence relation, and data or access constraints when those conditions are part of the open-architecture claim; non-module selection, procurement, work, evidence, assurance, gate, mechanism, and decision claims are governed by the patterns named in `A.6.M:12`. |
| `TeamBoundaryAsModule` | A team boundary, team responsibility label, communication boundary, or delivery unit is treated as a module interface. | Recover `A.15`, `A.2`, `VP.Procedural`, or `VP.RoleEnactor`; add A.6.M only for the declared module-interface relation; use `C.29` when a homomorphism-like correspondence claim is being made. |
| `MoreModulesMeansBetter` | More modules, teams, services, threads, or parallel paths are treated as automatic improvement. | Recover serial work, synchronization, communication overhead, shared resources, and bottleneck claims; mathematical speedup or homomorphism claims are governed by `C.29`, and characteristic tradeoffs are governed by `C.31` and `C.16`. |
| `PlatformAsKind` | A platform label becomes a root kind or quality claim. | Use `PlatformGrammarRef` and apply governing patterns for quality, measurement, and decision claims. |
| `StackAsArchitecture` | A stack diagram is treated as the architecture itself or as a module-interface relation by label. | Apply `C.30.STRAT` first; then use `C.30` or `C.30.ASV` for architecture or structural-view use, `A.6.M` only for a recovered module-interface relation, or ordinary source-label disposition. |

### A.6.M:9 - Consequences

Benefits:

- Module and interface talk becomes usable without minting false root kinds.
- Practitioners get a cheap relation repair before measurement or evidence work.
- MOSA and open-system claims become precise enough to make real substitution and change reasoning admissible.
- Functional, flow, control, mechanism, work, evidence, assurance, gate, decision, and causal claims stay with their governing patterns.

Costs:

- Ordinary architecture prose loses the convenience of treating boxes, ports, interfaces, and modules as one kind.
- Interface claims sometimes require additional records before substitutability can be relied on.
- "Open architecture" becomes harder to claim because interface publication alone is not enough.

### A.6.M:10 - Rationale

The central decision is to treat module as a context-sensitive and viewpoint-sensitive relation role of U.Holon, not as a new root kind. This keeps FPF compatible with many engineering contexts where the same system, episteme, method, organization, publication family, or other structured holon can be a component under one declared relation, a module under another, a bearer or candidate bearer recorded inside a functional-element record under another, and an evidence, assurance, source, or publication artifact under another.

A.6.M follows `A.6.P`: overloaded relation language is repaired by reconstructing kind, slots, qualifiers, admissible use, and witnesses. It also follows the architecture relation discipline: boundary notes catch the first confusion, while A.6.M supplies the full repair body for module relation, interface specification, substitutability, change policy, and open-architecture conformance and admissible-use claims.

The pattern deliberately keeps measurement out of the first move. A module relation can be repaired before anyone knows whether external coupling density, interface standardization share, evidence reuse, or reusable-structure accounting will be needed. When those claims are being made, A.6.M applies `C.31`, `C.31.RSA`, and `C.16`.

| Conway's law, the mirroring hypothesis, and Team Topologies and inverse Conway practice (`https://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html`; `https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2012.04.011`; `https://itrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TTOP_excerpt.pdf`) | Mature socio-technical law and empirical lineage plus current organization-design practice family; used as diagnostic pressure, not as a proof rule. | Team communication structure, team-boundary placement, and delivery responsibility can create real pressure on module and interface boundaries and useful correspondence clues. | Recover team and work material through `A.15`, `A.2`, `VP.RoleEnactor`, or `VP.Procedural` first; connect it to `ModuleInterfaceStructure` only through declared correspondence, allocation, boundary relation, and preserved and lost structure note. Use `C.29` when the correspondence is claimed as homomorphism-like or almost-same structure. | Do not treat Conway's law, an org chart, team responsibility label, or a delivery unit as proof of module interface, substitutability, modularity quality, evidence, gate passage, or architecture decision. | A practitioner may use team-boundary mismatch as a diagnostic prompt: repair the role, work, and module relation, then decide whether the module boundary, team boundary, communication relation, or architecture move changes. |
| Amdahl's law and communication and synchronization extensions (`https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~18742/papers/Amdahl1967.pdf`; `https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3302`; `https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.20654`) | Mature mathematical law plus current extension sources for communication, synchronization, and scalable-workload-fraction limits. | Serial work, synchronization, communication overhead, shared resources, and changing scalable workload fractions can limit the payoff of decomposition, parallelization, or specialization. | Use `C.29` for mathematical speedup or value-scalable-fraction reasoning, `E.18` for transformation-flow structure, `C.30.TFS-REL` when the module claim uses an architecture-to-transformation-flow relation, and `C.31` and `C.16` for modularity and characteristic tradeoffs. | Do not treat module count, team count, service count, parallel-path count, or accelerator count as improvement, scalability, throughput, or evolvability by itself. | A practitioner considering a module split names the serial part, shared bottleneck, synchronization or communication overhead, and characteristic tradeoff before claiming improvement. |
| SEI Views and Beyond, ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022, and multi-view architecture practice | Mature architecture-description lineage plus current international view-description discipline; not used as a current module-quality source. | Module and component-and-connector views are distinct architecture descriptions. | Use `ModuleInterfaceStructure` and `RuntimeInteractionStructure` as structure-kind signals under `C.30.ASV`. | Do not reduce architecture to a module diagram. | Module repair stays one architecture-structure concern, not the whole architecture ontology. |
| Platform and product-line engineering practice (`https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/fr/whitepapers/platform-eng-maturity-model/`; `https://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/variability-in-software-product-lines/`; `https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.21353`) | Mature product-line variability lineage plus current platform-engineering maturity-model and current SPLE-review cues; used for variability-slot and extension-rule discipline, not as one FPF platform kind. | Variation slots and extension rules matter for reuse and substitution. | Use `PlatformGrammarRef`, `variabilitySlotRefs`, and change policy instead of a platform root kind. | Do not treat platform name as architecture quality, architecture scale-preference evidence, procurement suitability, supplier-set selection, or decision authority. | The next move is to identify extension rules and substitution conditions; non-module quality, scale-preference, procurement, supplier-set, and decision claims are governed by the patterns named in `A.6.M:12` when those claims are being made. |
| Architecture-operation language, with neural-network and software-system intakes as source examples | Current practitioner-language source examples accepted by the architecture workstream; used as recognition material, not as a standard or current-best-known authority. | `C.30.STRAT` source labels, including source examples such as `block`, `layer`, `expert`, `router`, `cache`, and `state`, are useful recognition prompts. | Keep them as source labels until the recovered FPF kind, relation, claim-use, or source-use disposition is known; use A.6.M only for module-interface relation, interface specification, platform grammar, substitutability, or open-architecture module-interface claims. | Do not import source-context labels as module kinds or evidence of adequacy. | The same repair works for neural-network block replacement, hardware module substitution, organizational module repair, and episteme-module repair without making any source context the ontology. |

Older or local sources may serve as lineage or worked examples only when the row says so. They do not stand in for current competitive source, and they do not make a module, interface, platform, or open-architecture claim admissible for comparison, assurance, gate, selection, or decision use without the governing pattern for that use.

### A.6.M:12 - Relations

| Pattern | Relation |
| --- | --- |
| `A.6.P` | A.6.M is an RPR specialization for module-relation and interface-specification language. |
| `C.30.STRAT` | Recovers stratification and architecture-operation source labels before A.6.M governs only recovered module-interface relation cases. |
| `E.16` | Governs autonomy-budget, autonomous operation, independent acting, unsupervised decision or action, and freedom-of-action claims when those description or view uses are being made; A.6.M keeps only the module-interface relation, boundary, interface specification, and substitution or change-policy slice. |
| `A.14` | Component and part-whole wording uses A.14 first unless a module-interface relation is being claimed. |
| `A.6.0` and `A.6.5` | Signatures, slots, ports, endpoints, and field structure remain governed by signature and slot discipline. |
| `A.6.B`, `A.6.C`, and `A.6.8` | Boundary, interface-specification, API, protocol, service, promise, and duty wording uses A.6.M only when the claim is module-interface relation, interface specification, substitutability, change policy, platform grammar, or open-architecture module-interface claim. |
| `C.30` and `C.30.ASV` | Architecture claims and module-interface structural views stay architecture-governed. |
| `A.6.F` | Function and functional wording stays distinct from module allocation. |
| `A.15` and `A.2` | Method, work-plan, performed-work, role-assignment, role claims, enactor claims, team-boundary wording, and delivery-unit wording are governed by `A.15`, `A.2`, `VP.Procedural`, or `VP.RoleEnactor` unless a module-interface relation or correspondence is recovered; A.6.M governs only that recovered module-interface slice. |
| `E.18` and `C.30.TFS-REL` | E.18 transformation-flow relations, path slices, crossings, and flow valuations are not interface specifications. |
| `C.31` | Modularity and reusable-structure characteristics are governed by C.31 after relation repair when characteristic or measurement use is being made. |
| `C.31.RSA` | Reusable-structure accounting is governed by C.31.RSA when reusable loci, bespoke residue, or report-only share claims are being made. |
| `C.16` | Measurement, score, scale, unit, comparability, and evidence-stub legality remain C.16-governed. |
| `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `C.28`, `E.20`, `G.5`, `C.11` | Evidence, assurance, gates, causal use, mechanism suites, set-return selection, and local decisions use their governing patterns; they are not A.6.M claims. |
