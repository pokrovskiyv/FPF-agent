## A.6.RSIG - Recognition Signatures for Descriptions

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

### A.6.RSIG:1 - Problem frame

A reader often meets one description before they know whether it is the right
description to inspect. The reader may see a boundary clause, method note,
interface excerpt, pattern opening, or public projection. The first entry load is
not yet the full semantics of that description. It is first-contact recognition:
what description is seen, where it is encountered, what it applies to, what
excludes it, which `definitionEpistemeRef` identifies its defining `U.Episteme`, and which nearby reading or
wrong defining `U.Episteme` must be rejected.

**Plain recognition line.** Do not let the first wording you see define itself; ask which defining `U.Episteme` gives it meaning and which nearby reading it rejects.

Use this pattern when the live entry load is still first-contact recognition over
one encountered description carrier or projection.
 The reader needs to decide
whether this is the right description to inspect before broader comparison,
publication-face selection, boundary-claim routing, or pattern-language entry
comparison begins.

What goes wrong if this pattern is missed:

- one summary, excerpt, boundary phrase, or local top is mistaken for the
  defining `U.Episteme` of the description;
- one access/request description is over-read as a promise about downstream
  effect;
- one boundary-presented description is over-read as L/A/D/E-classified claim structure or
  as the full semantic claim set;
- one method note is treated as applicable before its actual method family and
  exclusions are recoverable;
- one pattern-local opening is forced to carry cross-pattern comparison that
  belongs to `E.11`.

What this pattern buys:

- the reader can tell what the encountered description is for before deeper
  semantics are reconstructed;
- carrier, projection, description, and defining `U.Episteme` stay distinct;
- false neighboring descriptions and wrong defining `U.Episteme` references become
  rejectable in one first pass;
- later boundary, publication, lexical, or pattern-language repairs start
  from a typed first-contact read instead of from guesswork.

Ordinary not-this-pattern boundary:

- not when the live entry load is already full routed-claim structure, published
  view law, lexical repair, or cross-pattern entry orientation;
- not when the real question is the whole semantics of the method, boundary
  claim, interface promise, or pattern;
- not when a search/query phrase needs naming repair rather than
  first-contact recognition of a particular encountered description.

### A.6.RSIG:2 - Problem

When first-contact recognition is under-governed, several defects recur:

1. One reader finds a boundary, method, interface, or pattern-local opening but
   cannot tell whether it is the right description to inspect.
2. An encountered carrier or public projection is misread as the defining `U.Episteme`.
3. Recognition cues drift into description semantics, workflow hints, graph
   metaphors, or lexical aliases that belong elsewhere.
4. Pattern-entry navigation is asked to solve a broader
   description-recognition entry load that belongs before pattern-language
   comparison begins.

### A.6.RSIG:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| First-contact precision vs reader economy | The cue needs enough discriminating detail without turning every opening into a mini essay. |
| Neutral substrate vs local specialization | This pattern governs description-recognition signatures in general without absorbing pattern-entry discoverability, publication-face law, or boundary-claim routing. |
| Recognition vs semantics | The cue helps the reader recover the right description and defining `U.Episteme`, not silently redefine the description's full semantics. |
| Carrier/projection vs authority | An encountered carrier can help recognition without becoming the defining episteme. |
| Local wording vs controlled lexemes | Real reader language remains usable without minting uncontrolled aliases or shadow names. |
| Readability vs auditability | The signature stays usable by readers while remaining crisp enough for later review and boundary checking. |

### A.6.RSIG:4 - Solution

#### A.6.RSIG:4.1 - Relation-signature object and non-goals

`A.6.RSIG` governs description-recognition signatures in general: the
first-contact cue structure by which one reader can recover what encountered
description is live, what carrier or projection exposed it, what it applies to,
what excludes it, which `definitionEpistemeRef` identifies its defining `U.Episteme`, and which nearby false
description or wrong defining `U.Episteme` must be rejected.

Here "description-recognition signature" is lower-case authoring and reading
discipline. It is not `U.Signature`, not a Signature Stack object, not a new
Description object by default, not a `U.*` kind, and not a specialization of
`A.6.0` unless another pattern explicitly promotes a particular declaration.

The encountered carrier or projection may help recognition; it does not become
authoritative merely by being encountered. When this pattern talks about an
encountered publication or projection, that wording does not mint a new surface
kind; use an existing publication face, publication form, interop publication form,
`U.View`, card, or lane kind only when that kind is actually being made.

Use `definitionEpistemeRef` for the defining `U.Episteme`. If the definition is available only through one publication, cite the `U.EpistemePublication` that publishes it separately; the publication, projection, or carrier does not become the defining episteme merely because it exposed the definition to the reader.

`A.6.RSIG` does not govern:

- general information architecture or search UX;
- documentation layout or publication-face selection;
- pattern-entry discoverability across a pattern language;
- the full semantics of the description itself;
- lexical repair, alias acceptance, or naming governance as such;
- graph ontology, workflow sequencing, or runtime route semantics.

#### A.6.RSIG:4.2 - Two-level description-recognition shape

**Reader-visible minimum.** For ordinary reader-facing use, the minimum is not a card. One or two good
sentences may be enough if they make recoverable:

1. what this description is for;
2. when it applies;
3. when it does not apply;
4. which definitionEpistemeRef applies;
5. what nearby false reading or wrong defining `U.Episteme` to reject.

**Review-expanded shape, only when needed.** When the recognition entry load is
load-bearing or under review, use the expanded recoverability shape:

```text
description_seen
encountered_carrier_or_projection
reader_viewpoint
case_signal_or_access_condition
applies_to
excludes
expected_first_recognition_gain
first_admissible_entry_stop_or_reroute
definitionEpistemeRef
projection_role_if_any
nearby_false_description_or_wrong_definition_episteme
```

This shape is a review aid, not a mandatory form for every encountered
description. It exists to keep description, carrier, projection, and definitionEpistemeRef from
collapsing into one overloaded publication label or projection label.

#### A.6.RSIG:4.2.1 - Minimal local repair and review sequence

Use this sequence when authoring or reviewing one recognition-signature repair:

1. Name the `description_seen` and the reader viewpoint in one concrete first
   sentence.
2. Name the encountered carrier or projection if confusing it with authority is
   a live risk.
3. State what the description applies to and what excludes it.
4. Name the defining `U.Episteme` to inspect first.
5. Name one nearby false description or wrong defining `U.Episteme` that looks
   plausible in the same situation.
6. State the first admissible entry stop or neighboring-pattern application.
7. If that stop cannot be stated without A.6.B claim routing, publication-face law,
   lexical repair, or cross-pattern comparison, apply the appropriate neighboring pattern instead of
   stretching `A.6.RSIG`.

Minimal admissible output:

- one first-contact recognition statement the reader can use immediately;
- one explicit defining `U.Episteme`;
- one explicit false-neighbor rejection;
- one admissible entry stop or reroute.

#### A.6.RSIG:4.3 - Parent cases

`A.6.RSIG` keeps the main parent cases explicit:

- **boundary-description recognition**: can one reader recover what one
  boundary-presented description is for before L/A/D/E-classified claim structure becomes
  the dominant entry load;
- **method-description applicability recognition**: can one reader recover
  whether one method description is the right description to inspect, reject, or
  compare under the live entry load;
- **interface/access-description recognition**: can one reader recover the
  right access or interface description without confusing it with promise,
  execution, or downstream effect semantics;
- **pattern-local recognition-signature case**: can one reader recover one
  pattern opening as the right first description to inspect before broader
  pattern-language comparison begins.

#### A.6.RSIG:4.4 - Neighbor boundaries

Neighbor boundaries remain explicit:

- `A.6.B` governs routed `L/A/D/E` claim structure when the boundary
  description is already in routed-claim territory;
- `E.17.0 / E.17` govern admissible view and publication-face projection when the
  same recognition entry load is carried through published views;
- `E.10.D2` and the `E.10 / F.18 / A.6.P` lane govern lexical repair,
  collision checks, and naming survival;
- `C.25 / C.16.Q` govern formal quality treatment when the discoverability or
  recognition claim becomes explicitly evaluative;
- the relevant authoritative pattern body governs pattern semantics when the
  encountered description is one pattern-local opening.

The four-part split for pattern-local recognition is:

| Recognition concern | Governing FPF pattern or source-maintenance role assignment | What it governs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic first-contact description recognition | `A.6.RSIG` | The neutral cue shape: description, carrier or projection, definitionEpistemeRef, exclusions, false neighbor. |
| Local placement and form | `E.8` | How the pattern's `Problem frame` carries the first-reading role. |
| Actual local semantics | The pattern itself | The pattern's relation-signature object, solution, consequences, and conformance law. |
| Cross-pattern comparison | `E.11` and `I.2` | Candidate patterns, tempting wrong patterns, entry-load reclassification, and expanded entry-disambiguation cases. |

#### A.6.RSIG:4.5 - No-minting rule

This pattern does not mint:

- one standalone `U.Discoverability`;
- one new `U.Signature`, Signature Stack object, `U.Characteristic`, `CHR`, or
  local `Q-Bundle`;
- one publication face kind, publication form kind, interop publication form kind, carrier kind, `DescriptionKind`, relation kind, graph ontology, pattern-reference publication
  graph, or process-family claim;
- one universal reader-orientation role.

If a recognition-signature entry load is promoted into a quality claim with a higher evidence requirement,
typed signature object, reusable description object, or publication-face law,
that promotion is explicit and handled by the existing neighboring
patterns.

### A.6.RSIG:5 - Archetypal grounding

#### A.6.RSIG:5.1 - System-side worked recognition repair: boundary-presented description

Draft cue:

> "The system shall reject invalid requests."

Why the cue is not enough yet:

- the reader can tell this is important, but not whether they are reading one
  law, admissibility gate, duty, work effect, or evidence statement;
- one summary page or local paraphrase can be mistaken for the governing
  boundary description;
- a reviewer can start arguing full semantics before the first-contact
  recognition entry load has been stabilized.

Recognition repair:

1. `description_seen` = one boundary-presented admissibility description.
2. `encountered_carrier_or_projection` = one clause or excerpt where the
   description is seen.
3. `reader_viewpoint` = one practitioner or reviewer deciding whether this is
   the right boundary description to inspect first.
4. `applies_to` = requests presented at the boundary under the declared
   admissibility conditions.
5. `excludes` = downstream effect claims, duty allocation, or evidence claims
   not actually stated by this description.
6. `definitionEpistemeRef` = the governing boundary description, not one local
   paraphrase or summary note.
7. `nearby_false_description_or_wrong_definition_episteme` = one evidence/work claim or one
   routed quadrant statement that only becomes admissible after the reader has
   stabilized the admissibility description.
8. `first_admissible_entry_stop_or_reroute` = the reader can now say "this is the
   admissibility description to inspect first"; if the entry load becomes routed
   claim structure, inspect `A.6.B`.

#### A.6.RSIG:5.2 - System-side anti-case: interface/access description over-read as promise

Draft cue:

> "`POST /deploy` triggers deployment."

Plausible but wrong first reading:

- the reader treats one access/request description as if it already promised
  one downstream operational effect or successful completion.

Recognition repair:

1. `description_seen` = one interface/access description.
2. `encountered_carrier_or_projection` = one API excerpt or endpoint note.
3. `applies_to` = request accessibility and invocation form.
4. `excludes` = success, completion, rollout, or downstream effect guarantees
   not present in the access description itself.
5. `definitionEpistemeRef` = the specification or pattern that actually governs
   downstream effect, if that entry load is live.
6. `first_admissible_entry_stop_or_reroute` = "this is the access description to
   inspect first, not the promise of the whole deployment result."

#### A.6.RSIG:5.3 - Episteme-side worked recognition repair: method-description applicability

Draft cue:

> "Use pairwise comparison."

Why the cue is not enough yet:

- the reader cannot tell whether the note applies to ranking alternatives,
  selecting one option, shaping a shortlist, or comparing method families;
- the method note can be mistaken for the defining `U.Episteme` of selection
  semantics;
- a team can prematurely choose `C.11` or `G.5` before knowing what kind of
  comparison entry load is actually being made.

Recognition repair:

1. `description_seen` = one method-description applicability note.
2. `encountered_carrier_or_projection` = one method-description note, pattern excerpt,
   or review comment that mentions pairwise comparison.
3. `applies_to` = comparison under a declared comparator set or characteristic
   family.
4. `excludes` = publication of a selected set, execution planning, evidence
   sufficiency, and one-off decision doctrine unless those governing FPF patterns or `authoritySourceRef` targets are separately
   opened.
5. `definitionEpistemeRef` = the relevant comparison or method pattern, not the
   note itself.
6. `nearby_false_description_or_wrong_definition_episteme` = selection/publication doctrine
   treated as if the method note had already settled it.
7. `first_admissible_entry_stop_or_reroute` = method applicability is recognized or
   rejected before selection semantics begin.

### A.6.RSIG:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern counters:

- front-door centralization bias, where every recognition entry load is pushed into
  one global front-door cue;
- signature-stack overreach, where any useful cue is prematurely promoted into
  `U.Signature`;
- carrier-authority collapse, where an encountered carrier or projection is
  treated as the defining `U.Episteme`;
- alias bias, where uncontrolled synonyms compensate for missing recognition
  structure;
- workflow bias, where first-contact recognition is narrated as sequence or
  handoff.

### A.6.RSIG:7 - Conformance checklist

- **CC-RSIG-1 First-contact only.** The pattern governs recognition of the
  right description, not the full semantics of that description.
- **CC-RSIG-2 Carrier/definition-episteme split.** A conforming description-recognition signature
  distinguishes `description_seen`, encountered carrier or projection,
  defining `U.Episteme`, and projection role when those distinctions are
  load-bearing. The encountered carrier or projection may help recognition,
  but it does not become authoritative merely by being encountered.
- **CC-RSIG-3 Neighbor boundaries explicit.** The text states when entry loads go
  to `A.6.B`, `E.17`, `E.10 / F.18 / A.6.P`, `C.25 / C.16.Q`, or the relevant
  authoritative pattern body.
- **CC-RSIG-4 No kind inflation.** Recognition signatures are not silently
  promoted into `U.Signature`, Signature Stack objects, publication face kinds, publication form kinds, carrier kinds,
  graph objects, workflow objects, or new `U.*` kinds.
- **CC-RSIG-5 Recoverable cue shape.** For load-bearing cases, description,
  viewpoint, cue, applicability, exclusion, defining `U.Episteme`, false neighbor,
  and admissible entry stop remain recoverable.
- **CC-RSIG-6 No alias minting.** Query cues and ordinary phrasing do not become
  aliases, bridges, semantic twins, or lexical authority without applying the relevant
  naming pattern or `authoritySourceRef` target.

### A.6.RSIG:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

- **Recognition-as-semantics.** The opening tries to define the whole
  description instead of making the right description recoverable. Repair by
  shrinking back to first-contact discrimination.
- **Carrier-as-authority.** A local excerpt, public projection, or retrieved
  fragment is treated as the defining `U.Episteme`. Repair by naming the
  encountered carrier or projection and the defining `U.Episteme` separately.
- **Boundary-routing collapse.** A boundary-description cue tries to absorb
  L/A/D/E-classified claim structure. Repair by classifying quadrant work under `A.6.B`.
- **Pattern-language collapse.** Pattern-entry comparison is written as if it
  were just another description cue. Repair by routing cross-pattern selection
  to `E.11`.
- **Signature inflation.** Any recurring cue is treated as one typed signature
  object. Repair by keeping `description-recognition signature` lower-case
  unless one explicit promotion is justified.

### A.6.RSIG:9 - Consequences

This pattern gives one neutral governing discipline for first-contact
description recognition without turning discoverability into one universal
governing pattern. It sharpens the boundary between cue recognition, semantic
authority, lexical repair, publication-face projection, and pattern-language
entry.

The cost is one extra explicit split when a cue is confusing: description,
encountered carrier or projection, defining `U.Episteme`, and false neighbor must not
be collapsed. The cost stays bounded because the expanded shape is review-only
or risk-triggered, not a required card for ordinary prose.

### A.6.RSIG:10 - Rationale

This pattern lands in the `A.6` cluster because the entry load is still one
description/signature entry load: a reader is recovering what one description is
for, what it applies to, and which defining `U.Episteme` to inspect first. That
sits closer to signature and boundary discipline than to pattern-language
navigation or review-profile law.

Read this honestly as one `FPF`-local synthesis over current SoTA, not as one
already established external standard term. It combines information-scent,
human/AI expectation-management, controlled vocabulary, and retrieval-context
practices into one description-facing discipline for `FPF`.

### A.6.RSIG:11 - SoTA-Echoing

This pattern is an `FPF`-local synthesis, not an established external term. It
carries the modern practice concern only where that concern sharpens one
description-facing recognition question: can the reader recover the right
description, its carrier or projection, its exclusions, its defining `U.Episteme`,
and its tempting false neighbor before relation precision or epistemic precision-restoration work begins?

| Pattern claim carried here | Source-bearing SoTA support (post-2015) | Alignment with `A.6.RSIG` | Adoption status and worked-slice implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First-contact recognition is narrower than general information architecture or documentation UX. | Jorge Arango (2018), *Living in Information: Responsible Design for Digital Places*; ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514:2022, *Systems and software engineering - Design and development of information for users*. | These sources support purposeful information places and user information shaped around what the user needs. `A.6.RSIG` narrows that to one encountered description: what it is for, what applies, what excludes, what carrier exposed it, and which `definitionEpistemeRef` identifies the defining episteme. | **Adopt or narrow.** Adopt the recognition and information-need concern; reject a universal UX or layout pattern. In the boundary sentence slice, the first repair is not "what does the complete Contract Bundle mean?" but "what description is this, what does it apply to, and which definitionEpistemeRef applies?" |
| Information scent helps first-contact cue economy but is not the defining episteme. | Raluca Budiu (2020), "Information Scent: How Users Decide Where to Go Next", Nielsen Norman Group. | Information scent treats visible labels, context, and prior knowledge as imperfect estimates of source value. `A.6.RSIG` adopts the cue-economy insight and adds definition-episteme, exclusion, and false-neighbor discipline. | **Adopt and add definition-episteme discipline.** Adopt first-contact cue economy; reject treating familiar wording, link scent, or local projection as the defining `U.Episteme`. In the API slice, a good endpoint label can attract attention while still failing to promise deployment success. |
| Description-recognition signatures help human and AI-assisted readers manage applicability and limitation expectations. | Amershi et al. (2019), "Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction", CHI 2019. | Human-AI guidance emphasizes making capabilities and limits clear enough for users to calibrate trust. `A.6.RSIG` adapts that pressure into `applies_to`, `excludes`, `definitionEpistemeRef`, and admissible entry stop for human and AI-assisted readers. | **Adapt.** Adopt expectation management; reject making this an AI-interface pattern. In the method-note slice, the reader learns what the note can and cannot settle before using it for a decision. |
| Description-recognition cues need controlled wording without becoming synonym or alias governance. | Helen Lippell, ed. (2022), *Taxonomies: Practical Approaches to Developing and Managing Vocabularies for Digital Information*. | Taxonomy practice supports governed terms, validation, and maintenance for search and browse. `A.6.RSIG` adopts stable cue language while leaving naming, alias, bridge, and collision repair to `F.18 / E.10 / A.6.P`. | **Adapt.** Adopt controlled-lexeme discipline; reject synonym stuffing inside description-recognition signatures. The worked slices state definitionEpistemeRef, exclusions, and false neighbor instead of adding more query phrases. |
| Thin echoes and projection snippets need definition-episteme anchors before a reader or retrieval system treats them as the defining episteme. | Lewis et al. (2020), "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks"; Liu, Zhang, and Liang (2023), "Evaluating Verifiability in Generative Search Engines"; Gao et al. (2023), "Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations". | Retrieval and citation work makes source context, support, and verifiability load-bearing. `A.6.RSIG` adapts this as recognition hygiene: retrieved fragments, public projections, or local examples remain useful only when their defining `U.Episteme` and projection role are recoverable. | **Adapt / narrow.** Adopt source anchoring and citation-support pressure; reject a retrieval benchmark or graph-native authority. A retrieved method note is safe only when it remains a method-applicability cue, not the defining episteme for selection semantics. |
| Description-recognition-signature adequacy is reviewable through small, case-linked checks rather than folklore or heavy empirical machinery. | Riehle, Harutyunyan, and Barcomb (2020), *Pattern Discovery and Validation Using Scientific Research Methods*, Technical Report CS-2020-01. | Pattern-validation practice supports explicit evidence and case adequacy. `A.6.RSIG` keeps that pressure lightweight: use the first-contact shape, false-neighbor rejection, and worked slices before escalating to `C.25`, `C.16.Q`, or empirical evidence. | **Adopt / lightweight.** Adopt accountable validation; reject mandatory benchmark machinery for ordinary recognition repairs. |
