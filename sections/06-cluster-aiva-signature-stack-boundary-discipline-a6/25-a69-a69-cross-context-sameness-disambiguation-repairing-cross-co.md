## A.6.9 - Cross-Context Sameness Disambiguation - Repairing cross-context "same", "equivalent", and "align" via explicit Bridges (RPR-XCTX)
> **Type:** Relational precision-restoration pattern
> **Status:** Stable

**Use this pattern when** a document, table row, boundary statement, or publication claim uses *same*, *equivalent*, *aligned*, *mapped*, or *corresponding* in a way that may hide ordinary designation, a non-semantic lane or id claim, or a real relation between exact local senses.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A label match, explanation, ID mapping, or partial correspondence becomes global identity or a licence for an unspecified use. Direction, use rule, tolerated loss, evidence, and the actual downstream act disappear inside one umbrella word.

**What this buys.** The sentence becomes one concrete result: a same-context designation, a claim routed to its direct owner, an obtaining F.9 Bridge plus a separately stated bounded use, or an explicit stop. A card is added only when the claims must travel.

### E.24.UK settlement

A.6.9 admits neither `U.CrossContextSamenessDisambiguation` nor a semantic-context entity as a durable U-kind. It reuses exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values, the direct F.9 `Bridge` relation, ordinary C.2.1 claims, and the existing A.10 or B.3 reliance branch. It introduces no public use-claim kind, universal use relation, shared assessment object, permission kind, or receiving-use occurrence.

> **Type:** Architectural (A) — A.6.P specialisation (RPR)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative
> **Placement:** A.6 cluster; follows the A.6.P relation-precision route for cross-context wording.
> **Builds on:** A.6.P for relational prose repair; F.17 for exact scheme-based SenseCells; F.18 for designation; F.9 for the direct Bridge relation, profile, bounded-use boundary, and card boundary; C.2.1 for claim and description identity; F.0.1, F.7, and F.8 for sense-family and downstream naming discipline; A.7 and A.6.6 for lane and identifier dispatch; E.19 for normative precision
> **Coordinates with:** A.10 for evidence-provenance relations and local reliance dispositions; B.3 for assurance; E.17 for views and publication; C.3.3 for kind or classification transfer; A.2.6 for scope operations; A.6.3.RT for representation transition; A.22 for structure; A.2.1, F.6, and A.15.1 for role and Work claims

Use this pattern when umbrella sameness wording could hide which exact local senses, designation, lane, identifier, scope operation, representation transition, structure relation, or proposed use is current. The trigger starts a dispatch; it does not oblige the author to assert a Bridge or complete a card.

When the remaining question is semantic, recover the obtaining Bridge first. Then state the proposed use separately in ordinary language: what someone will do, in which direction, by which correspondence rule, and how much semantic loss that use tolerates. Give that C.2.1 claim affirmative or negative polarity. F.9, A.10, and B.3 supply the exact follow-through; A.6.9 teaches the reader how to recover it from ambiguous prose.

### A.6.9:1 - Problem frame

Cross-context prose routinely compresses a multi-part claim into one adjective: *same*, *equivalent*, *align*, *map*, *matches*, or *corresponds*.

First decide whether this is a Bridge situation at all. A positive F.9 case has two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` endpoints whose `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projections differ, plus an applicable relation-semantic profile whose predicate is true for those cells. A label, id, system, mapping implementation, selected structure, card, or publication cannot substitute for those objects.

If a Bridge obtains, several questions still remain independent:

* what concrete comparison, substitution, translation, explanation, publication, or other use is proposed;
* the direction of that use;
* the use-specific correspondence rule;
* the semantic-loss tolerance for that use;
* whether the C.2.1 claim about that use is affirmative or negative;
* whether current A.10 evidence or B.3 assurance supports relying on that claim;
* whether separate authorization is required; and
* whether any Work, assertion, publication, relation, operation application, or other receiving object actually occurred.

A.6.9 makes that dispatch visible. It prevents an explanation, mapping witness, score, or polished card from becoming global identity, authorization, or proof of performance.

### A.6.9:2 - Problem

When an umbrella predicate is used as if it were a complete answer, readers silently choose defaults:

* **Symmetry hallucination:** “equivalent” is read as symmetric even when the intended relation is narrower or broader.
* **Relation-to-use jump:** a true correspondence is treated as sufficient for the requested comparison or substitution.
* **Loss erasure:** “same” implies lossless transfer although units, granularity, preconditions, or stance differ.
* **Permission confusion:** “A is suitable for this comparison” is read as permission or authorization to perform it.
* **Implicit inversion:** relation symmetry is treated as two safe use directions, or endpoint order is mistaken for the safe inclusion direction.
* **Occurrence smuggling:** a named “publication use” or “mapping use” is treated as an actual publication or mapping operation.
* **Temporal incoherence:** an unpinned claim silently combines different glossary, schema, code-list, ontology, or model editions.

These are ontology and inference defects, not merely word-choice defects.

### A.6.9:3 - Forces

| Force | Pull | Push |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brevity | One word such as “same” is fast. | It hides the object, action, direction, rule, tolerance, and stop. |
| Practical interoperability | Teams want shared labels and reusable mappings. | Shared labels and running code are not semantic identity or proof of a safe use. |
| Relation versus use | One semantic relation can remain fixed. | Different uses of it can have opposite polarity or different evidence. |
| Direction | A relation may be symmetric or oriented. | Every proposed use still has its own source-to-receiving direction. |
| Evidence evolves | Counterexamples and warrants change. | Evidence change should reopen reliance without silently reidentifying the Bridge. |
| Version drift | Canons and models change by edition. | The relation profile needs an applicability and as-of basis. |
| Practical safety | Cross-context reuse can save work. | Suitability, reliance, authorization, and actual performance must not collapse. |

### A.6.9:4 - Solution

Treat an umbrella sameness sentence as a **dispatch trigger**, not as an automatic Bridge and not as a demand for a card. Recover the concrete subject and action first. Then choose the smallest truthful branch:

1. **Ordinary designation inside one semantic context.** If both expressions resolve under the same `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projection and the current action needs only the governed designation, rewrite with that designation and stop. No F.9 Bridge is current.
2. **Lane or reference-plane repair.** If the sentence confuses Object, Description, Carrier, or `CHR:ReferencePlane`, restore the exact kinds under A.7 or the governing plane rule.
3. **Identification or indexing.** If the sentence means same id, key, code, or index target, use A.6.6. Identifier equality does not establish meaning correspondence.
4. **Claim-scope operation.** Use A.2.6 `widen`, `narrow`, or `refit` inside one semantic context. A `translate` operation may consume an independently obtaining Bridge and a separate affirmative claim for that translation.
5. **Representation transition.** Route an actual source-to-receiving representation change to A.6.3.RT. A Bridge neither performs the Work nor creates the transition.
6. **Structure comparison or crossing.** Recover each exact A.22 structure and its organizing relations. A sense Bridge between names does not relate the structures by itself.
7. **Cross-local semantic relation.** Resolve two exact F.17 cells, declare the F.9 relation-semantic profile, and cite a Bridge only when its predicate obtains.
8. **Proposed use of an obtaining Bridge.** In a second sentence, name action `u`, direction `d`, use-specific rule `r`, tolerated loss `t`, and claim polarity under C.2.1. Recover A.10 or B.3 reliance for that same use.
9. **Explanation or unresolved proposal.** Say plainly what remains unestablished. A candidate or negative card carries no positive occurrence reference.
10. **Claim that the use happened.** Name the actual receiving object and open its direct governor; the use role inside the C.2.1 claim is not that object.

For A.6.9, **semantic context** is Plain shorthand for the bounded interpretation basis derived from one exact cell's `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projection. It is not a `U.BoundedContext`, entity, ref, project, scope, selected model-use structure, viewpoint, description, designator, or publication.

#### A.6.9:4.0 - Trigger and endpoint recovery

Open the dispatch when **same**, **identical**, **equivalent**, **align**, **map**, **match**, **correspond**, *treat as*, *reuse*, *share*, *unify*, *canonical source*, *synced*, *normalized*, *one-to-one*, *same ID*, or *mirrors* could hide the current object or action. Apply equivalent triggers in any language.

Resolve the actual endpoints before choosing the semantic branch. Each candidate endpoint must be a `SenseCellAddressRef` resolving one exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell`; a string, system, table, class name, file, context label, card, or id cannot stand in for it. If a token is metonymic — *the system*, *the model*, *the service*, *that table* — enumerate the plausible governed objects and recover the intended local expression and claim. If either endpoint remains unresolved, keep the sentence explanatory and return `unresolved SenseCell endpoint`.

Pin the endpoint reference-scheme and local-sense-claim editions, or an exact as-of basis, when the correspondence can change with a canon or model edition. `Γ_time` may be used as a compact card label for that basis. It is not a participant. It contributes to profile identity only when it states the profile's exact applicability or as-of basis.

Before testing a Bridge, check ontological strata. Kind or classification transfer remains with C.3.3; value normalization with the measurement owner; role assignment with A.2.1; performed-Work attribution with F.6; publication with E.17; representation transition with A.6.3.RT. F.9 can supply a semantic premise needed by one of those claims but cannot make that neighboring object obtain.

#### A.6.9:4.1 - Stable lens: relation, use claim, reliance, and receiving object

Keep these objects distinct:

1. **Bridge occurrence.** The direct relation has exactly two F.17 cell participants and obtains under one exact F.9 profile.
2. **BridgePredicateProfile.** It contains only Bridge kind, kind-defined symmetry or orientation, endpoint-sense readings, relation-specific correspondence or difference condition, applicability and as-of basis, Boolean truth condition, and stop dependencies.
3. **Bounded-use claim.** An ordinary C.2.1 claim says whether the exact obtaining Bridge is suitable for `<u,d,r,t>`. Its EntityOfConcern is the Bridge; its ClaimGraph designates the use, direction, rule, tolerance, and polarity; its effective scheme interprets them.
4. **Optional Bridge Card.** It packages claims and evidence when durable reuse pays. It neither creates the relation nor grants the use.
5. **Separately governed receiving object.** If the use happened, its Work, assertion, publication, direct relation, operation application, or other object keeps its own participants, obtaining or performance condition, and identity.

```text
Bridge(SourceSenseCell, ReceivingSenseCell; BridgePredicateProfile)
```

Use that notation only after the F.9 predicate passes. For a proposal, write `candidate Bridge(...)` or use a candidate card with no positive occurrence reference.

Changing `u`, `d`, `r`, or `t` changes the bounded-use claim, not the Bridge. Changing evidence, an A.10 relation or local `RelianceDisposition`, or a B.3 claim, record, or disposition reopens reliance without reidentifying either fixed object. A changed endpoint or relation-semantic profile identifies another Bridge candidate.

#### A.6.9:4.2 - Explicit claim skeleton

| Item | When required | Meaning and stop |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `SourceSenseCellRef`, `ReceivingSenseCellRef` | every Bridge candidate | Exact F.17 addresses; unresolved endpoints stop the semantic branch. |
| semantic-context projections | every Bridge candidate | Derived `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` pairs; they must differ for F.9. |
| `BridgePredicateProfile` | every Bridge candidate | Exact by-value relation semantics only; a label or id is insufficient. |
| `BridgeKind` and relation orientation | profile and readable explanation | What semantic correspondence or difference is claimed; not a use licence. |
| applicability / `Γ_time`, truth condition, dependencies | profile | When and how the direct predicate is tested; missing dependencies stop without inventing an occurrence. |
| action `u` | every proposed use | What the reader proposes to compare, substitute, translate, publish, or otherwise do. |
| direction `d` | every proposed use | Exact use-source to use-receiving order; relation symmetry supplies no direction by implication. |
| rule `r` | every proposed use | The correspondence rule the action will follow. |
| tolerance `t` | every proposed use | Which semantic loss is acceptable for this action; observed loss remains evidence. |
| polarity and effective ReferenceScheme | every bounded-use claim | Whether the claim is affirmative or negative and how its designations are interpreted. |
| A.10 or B.3 branch | when someone will rely on the claim | The exact evidence-provenance relation plus local disposition, or the B.3 claim or explicit disposition selected by its trigger. |
| authorization claim | only when permission is required | Separate policy or deontic governor; semantic suitability and assurance are insufficient. |
| receiving-object ref | only when the use is said to have happened | Exact Work, assertion, publication, relation, application, or other object under its owner. |
| `ClaimMode` and card EntityOfConcern | only when a card pays | Actual card concerns the obtaining Bridge; candidate or negative card concerns the admitted F.9 Bridge relation kind and carries proposed endpoints and profile in its ClaimGraph. |

Only the two endpoint cells fill the direct relation's participant slots. Use content is ClaimGraph content, not another relation participant or profile component.

#### A.6.9:4.3 - Judgement and change

Choose the least-committing truthful Bridge kind: `Equivalence`, `Narrower-than`, `Broader-than`, `Partial-overlap`, `Disjoint`, or one declared cross-family relation kind. The kind settles relation semantics only.

Then judge the proposed use:

* `Partial-overlap` can support an affirmative label-use claim when its exact rule preserves the named differences; the Bridge does not grant that use automatically.
* `Disjoint` can support a contrastive explanation; a proposed substitution receives negative polarity.
* `Equivalence` is symmetric, but `A -> B` and `B -> A` are different use claims.
* `Narrower-than` and `Broader-than` orient the semantic relation. Narrower-to-broader is usually easier to warrant, but every use direction still needs its own rule, tolerance, polarity, and reliance.
* A broader-to-narrower proposal normally requires refined cells and a separately tested Bridge. Another profile over the same broad endpoints cannot make an unsafe use safe by declaration.
* Type-structure reuse requires a separate claim naming the structural rule and loss tolerance. Matched invariants can support that claim; no `CL` number grants it.

`CL` may remain optional evidence shorthand: `0` contradicted, `1` weakly comparable, `2` bounded support with counterexamples, `3` matched stated invariants with no current material counterexample. It is neither profile identity nor a suitability threshold.

Narrate changes by the object that changed:

1. `retargetEndpoint` for another source or receiving cell;
2. `replaceBridgeProfile` for changed relation-semantic content;
3. `reviseBoundedUseClaim` for changed `u`, `d`, `r`, `t`, effective scheme, or polarity;
4. `retestObtaining` for changed endpoint facts or dependencies under the fixed profile;
5. `reopenReliance` for changed evidence, currentness, A.10 relation or disposition, or B.3 claim, record, or disposition;
6. `reviseBridgeCard` for changed package content;
7. `publishBridgeCardEdition` for a publication occurrence; and
8. `recoverReceivingObject` when the use is claimed to have happened.

An inverse asymmetric relation and any direct A-to-C relation require their own profiles and tests. Two chained Bridges do not entail a third.

#### A.6.9:4.4 - Lexical guardrails

In normative or decision-carrying prose, replace the umbrella word with a sentence that exposes the action and stop:

| Intended meaning | Plain action | Exact follow-through |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ordinary same-context designation | “Both expressions designate this local sense.” | Cite the common projection and naming owner; no Bridge. |
| interpretation | “Use A to explain B; do not substitute it.” | Test the cross-family Bridge; state a separate affirmative explanation-use claim and its nearest non-use. |
| naming convenience | “Use the label ‘actor’ in this comparison; keep account and customer eligibility distinct.” | Obtaining Bridge plus a C.2.1 claim naming direction, label rule, and zero tolerance for eligibility transfer. |
| directional substitution | “For calculation X, read A as B by rule R within tolerance T; do not reverse it.” | Obtaining Bridge, affirmative claim for `<X,A->B,R,T>`, and current A.10 or B.3 reliance. |
| type-structure reuse | “Reuse this subtype row only while invariants I remain true and loss stays within T.” | Obtaining Bridge plus a separately warranted structural-use claim. |
| contrast | “These senses differ in this stated way; do not substitute them.” | Obtaining `Disjoint` or `Partial-overlap` Bridge plus negative substitution-use polarity. |
| unresolved proposal | “The mapping is available, but the semantic relation is not established.” | Candidate card or plain stop naming the missing endpoint, predicate fact, or dependency. |

Plain teaching prose may retain *same*, *align*, or *map* only when the local sentence also tells the reader what to do, what not to infer, and what result would reopen the claim.

#### A.6.9:4.5 - Disambiguation guide

| Trigger | First question | Default route | Stop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| “A is the same as B” | Same local sense or relation between distinct senses? | designation first; otherwise least-committing F.9 kind | no exact cells or predicate -> explanatory only |
| “Align A and B” | Shared label, comparison, substitution, or structure use? | name the proposed action before selecting a Bridge | mapping score alone establishes neither relation nor use |
| “Map A to B” | Semantic reading or operational transformation? | keep code or ETL as witness; test semantics separately | code direction is not use suitability |
| “Same ID/key/one-to-one” | Identifier relation or meaning relation? | A.6.6 first | collision-free ids do not establish sense identity |
| “B is a view/projection of A” | View membership, representation, or sense reuse? | E.17, C.29, or representation owner first | dropped constraints block stronger use claims |
| “Equivalent” | What relation, action, direction, rule, and tolerance? | test overlap or inclusion before equivalence | symmetry alone grants no use |

#### A.6.9:4.6 - Mapping witnesses are not Bridges

A lookup table, aligner model, transformation function, API, or ETL step is an implementation or evidence object. It may support the claim that a Bridge obtains or that one bounded use is suitable. It does not determine either claim by itself. Code may run `A -> B` while the semantic Bridge is symmetric, oriented the other way, or absent; and even an obtaining Bridge may be unsuitable for that operation's rule or tolerance.

Keep the witness in the A.10 evidence path or optional card. Test the F.9 predicate first, state the C.2.1 bounded-use claim second, and recover reliance third.

#### A.6.9:4.7 - Coordination boundaries

- **Naming:** F.18 selects designations; F.17 publishes exact scheme-based cells and rows. Neither creates a Bridge.
- **Evidence and assurance:** A.10 owns evidence provenance and local reliance; B.3 owns assurance claims, records, and explicit dispositions.
- **Scopes:** A.2.6 owns `widen`, `narrow`, `refit`, and `translate`; translation consumes an obtaining Bridge only together with an affirmative claim for its exact direction, rule, and tolerance.
- **Views, representations, and publications:** E.17, C.29, and A.6.3.RT own their objects and occurrences.
- **Kinds and classifications:** C.3.3 owns classification transfer; F.9 supplies only local-sense correspondence needed by that use.
- **Structures:** A.22 and direct relation owners identify structures and crossings. A sense Bridge cannot substitute for that architecture.
- **Work and roles:** A.2.1, F.6, and A.15.1 own assignments and performed Work; a semantic relation or use claim has no enactment effect.
- **Authorization:** the exact policy or deontic governor owns permission. Neither semantic suitability nor assurance grants it.

### A.6.9:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### A.6.9:5.1 - System archetype: IAM User and CRM Customer

The ambiguous sentence is: “An IAM User is the same as a CRM Customer.”

Resolve exact endpoints:

- `SenseCell(IAMRoleReferenceScheme-v3, User-human-or-service-account-role)`;
- `SenseCell(CRMRoleReferenceScheme-v5, Customer-commercial-party-role)`.

Current meanings share some human participants, while service accounts and prospects provide counterexamples. Profile `P-IAM-CRM-OVERLAP-v2` states only the symmetric `Partial-overlap` relation, exact endpoint readings, overlap and difference conditions, edition basis, truth condition, and required membership evidence. Those facts make Bridge `b-iam-crm` obtain.

Now state the use separately. Dashboard team proposes `u-actor-label`: render IAM users as “actors” in a CRM-oriented comparison. Direction `d-iam-crm` is IAM-to-CRM dashboard reading. Rule `r-actor` keeps account eligibility and customer eligibility visible as separate columns. Tolerance `t-actor` allows the shared label but no eligibility, assignment, workflow, or Work inference. A C.2.1 claim about `b-iam-crm` is affirmative for `<u-actor-label,d-iam-crm,r-actor,t-actor>`.

The exact A.10 evidence-provenance relation and `RelianceDisposition=pass` support that claim only for the named dashboard comparison. They do not authorize data processing, assign a role, or prove that a dashboard publication occurred. Reverse label reuse is another bounded-use claim even though the Bridge relation is symmetric.

An optional actual card may package the Bridge claim, this bounded-use claim, observed counterexamples, the A.10 path and disposition, currentness, and nearest non-use. Its EntityOfConcern is `b-iam-crm`; the card neither creates the relation nor performs the dashboard work.

If a later workflow isolates `HumanVerifiedUser` and `VerifiedCustomer`, refine both cells and test another Bridge. A stronger use claim over the broad cells cannot repair a false or unsuitable predicate.

#### A.6.9:5.2 - Episteme archetype: Person in two knowledge-graph schemes

The sentence is: “Person in KG-A is equivalent to Person in KG-B.” The exact cells are `Person-including-fictional` under KG-A v4 and `Person-real-with-external-id` under KG-B v7. Sherlock Holmes and the external-id rule show `Partial-overlap`, not equivalence. The exact overlap Bridge obtains under the least-committing profile.

Two proposed uses then receive separate claims. A glossary comparison that labels both rows “Person” while displaying the fiction and external-id differences can receive affirmative polarity with a warranted A.10 path. A type-structure merge receives negative polarity because its correspondence rule cannot preserve membership and its tolerance permits no such loss. Both claims concern the same Bridge; neither changes its identity. Refining KG-A into `RealPerson` and `FictionalPerson` changes an endpoint and opens a new Bridge test.

### A.6.9:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern is biased toward:

* **Explicit action over fluent ambiguity.** It slows only sentences that would otherwise hide what someone will do.
* **Relation-use separation.** One Bridge can support several independently tested uses without becoming a licence.
* **Locality of meaning.** Exact scheme and local-sense claims provide the interpretation basis without a reified context bearer.
* **Evidence humility.** Scores, counterexamples, and invariants inform claims and reliance but do not manufacture relation truth or permission.

The dispatch stays cheap: same-context designation and direct-owner cases stop before F.9. The heavier path is reserved for a cross-local relation that a named use will actually consume.

### A.6.9:7 - Conformance Checklist

A repaired sentence or boundary statement conforms iff:

1. **Concrete action.** The reader can say what object, comparison, substitution, translation, publication, or other action is at issue.
2. **Dispatch before Bridge.** Designation, lane, id, scope, representation, structure, role, and Work claims go to their direct owners first.
3. **Exact endpoints.** Every Bridge candidate uses two F.17 cell addresses resolving exact values.
4. **No context object.** Semantic context is derived from endpoint content and introduces no extra participant.
5. **Direct Bridge truth.** A positive occurrence appears only after the exact profile applies, its predicate is true, and dependencies are present.
6. **Profile boundary.** Profile identity contains relation semantics only, with no use, tolerance, polarity, reliance, authorization, or receiving object.
7. **Separate use claim.** Every proposed use names `u`, `d`, `r`, `t`, polarity, and effective scheme in a C.2.1 claim about the exact Bridge.
8. **Evidence honesty.** Observed loss and mapping witnesses stay in evidence; permitted loss stays in the bounded-use claim; `CL` grants nothing.
9. **Reliance branch.** Current reliance follows A.10 or B.3 for the same use and does not become authorization.
10. **Receiving-object boundary.** Any claim that the use happened recovers the actual object under its direct owner.
11. **Card boundary.** Actual, candidate, and negative cards use the correct EntityOfConcern and never create a Bridge or receiving occurrence.
12. **Change honesty.** Endpoint, profile, use claim, reliance, card, publication, and receiving-object changes remain distinct.
13. **No inverse or composition.** An asymmetric inverse, opposite use direction, or direct A-to-C Bridge gets its own exact judgement.
14. **Practical result.** The final sentence tells the reader what to do, what not to infer, and what condition would stop or reopen the result.

### A.6.9:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| ID | Anti-pattern | Failure | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AP-XCTX-1` | Bridge by adjective | *Same* or *aligned* hides relation and action. | Name the action; dispatch it; test F.9 only if semantic correspondence remains. |
| `AP-XCTX-2` | Scheme difference becomes relation | Two schemes differ, so a Bridge is presumed. | Treat difference as a trigger only; establish the direct predicate. |
| `AP-XCTX-3` | Profile as use licence | Direction, rule, or tolerated loss is embedded in profile identity. | Move it to the separate C.2.1 bounded-use claim. |
| `AP-XCTX-4` | Bridge-alone substitution | An obtaining Bridge is cited as sufficient for a use. | Require the affirmative bounded-use claim and current A.10 or B.3 reliance. |
| `AP-XCTX-5` | Mapping witness becomes semantics | A lookup, score, or ETL path proves the relation or use. | Keep it as evidence and test both propositions explicitly. |
| `AP-XCTX-6` | String or id becomes endpoint | A word, file, id, or system fills a SenseCell slot. | Resolve the exact F.17 cell; route ids to A.6.6. |
| `AP-XCTX-7` | Symmetry grants two use directions | One symmetric occurrence is read as two licences. | State each direction in its own use claim. |
| `AP-XCTX-8` | Loss note becomes tolerance | An observed difference is assumed acceptable. | Keep it in evidence and name accepted loss as `t`. |
| `AP-XCTX-9` | Confidence laundering | Higher `CL` or reviewer approval grants a use. | Treat `CL` as evidence shorthand and recover claim polarity plus reliance. |
| `AP-XCTX-10` | Suitability becomes permission | An affirmative semantic claim is read as authorization. | Open the exact policy or deontic governor, or state no authorization. |
| `AP-XCTX-11` | Named use becomes occurrence | “Publication use” is treated as a publication. | Recover the exact receiving object under E.17 or its actual owner. |
| `AP-XCTX-12` | Chain upgrade | A-to-B and B-to-C become direct A-to-C equivalence. | Test a direct A-to-C Bridge and composite use independently. |
| `AP-XCTX-13` | Timeless or facetless claim | Edition or compared facet stays hidden. | State applicability and refine endpoint readings. |
| `AP-XCTX-14` | Kernel promotion | A strong Bridge is used to admit one global U-kind. | Apply E.24.UK and A.11 independently. |

### A.6.9:9 - Consequences

* **Pros**

  * Turns ambiguous sameness into a visible relation question and a visible action question.
  * Lets one Bridge remain stable while use direction, tolerance, evidence, and polarity change.
  * Prevents scores, cards, assurance, and publications from becoming hidden permission or occurrence.
  * Gives authors exact local stops instead of a vague “not equivalent”.

* **Cons**

  * A positive use normally needs two sentences instead of one adjective.
  * Reviewers must inspect the correspondence rule, tolerated loss, and evidence for the named action.
  * Many attractive “same” claims become only an explanatory comparison or a negative use claim.

**Adoption test (PRAG).** Take one sentence containing *same*, *equivalent*, *align*, or *map*. A practitioner passes when they can name the concrete action, route non-semantic branches, identify the two exact cells, say whether the Bridge obtains, state the separate bounded-use claim and reliance branch, and name any authorization or receiving occurrence still missing. Otherwise keep the sentence explanatory and return the exact missing fact.

### A.6.9:10 - Rationale

Cross-context sameness wording is not one predicate. A.6.9 first restores the actual question and routes designation, lane, id, scope, representation, structure, role, and Work claims to their owners. Only the remaining cross-local semantic question reaches F.9.

For that branch, exact cells and a relation-only profile make correspondence falsifiable. A separate C.2.1 claim makes the proposed use equally explicit without reidentifying the Bridge. A.10 or B.3 can reopen reliance without changing either object. Authorization and the actual receiving object remain visible rather than hiding inside *suitable*, *aligned*, or *mapped*.

The repair sequence is therefore: **name the action; route the object; test the relation; state the use; check reliance; recover permission or performance only when claimed.**

### A.6.9:11 - SoTA-Echoing

(informative; post-2015 alignment)

| SoTA practice | Primary source | What A.6.9 echoes | What A.6.9 adds | Stance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Correspondences between viewpoints | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 | Correspondence is not identity and retains intent and constraints. | Separates the direct semantic relation from each proposed use and actual publication or view object. | **Adopt + specialise** |
| Declarative validation shapes | W3C SHACL (2017) | Make implicit conditions testable. | Uses a profile for relation truth, a claim for bounded-use suitability, and a card only for packaging. | **Adapt** |
| Scored entity alignment with error analysis | BootEA (Sun et al., 2018) and later KG-alignment literature | Alignment evidence is graded and fallible. | Keeps scores and counterexamples as evidence rather than relation identity or a use licence. | **Adapt** |
| Textual entity matching | BERT-INT (Tang et al., 2020); Ditto (Li et al., 2021) | Matchers yield conditional, error-prone correspondences. | Requires exact endpoint readings, a falsifiable Bridge predicate, and a separate action-specific claim. | **Adopt conceptually** |
| Heterogeneous schema matching | SMAT (Zhang et al., 2021) and later neural or LLM matching work | “Match” covers several relation types. | Distinguishes relation kind, relation orientation, proposed-use direction, rule, and tolerance. | **Adapt** |
| Human-in-the-loop matching | Mudgal et al. (SIGMOD 2018) and follow-on work | Scores require abstention and curated error cases. | Routes evidence through A.10 or B.3 and preserves explicit negative or blocked outcomes. | **Adapt** |

### A.6.9:12 - Relations

* **Specialises:** A.6.P by restoring the concrete object and action hidden by cross-context sameness wording.
* **Uses:** F.17 exact `SchemeSenseCell` identity; F.9 Bridge participants, relation-only profile, obtaining, occurrence identity, bounded-use boundary, and card boundary; C.2.1 claim identity and polarity; A.10 or B.3 for reliance.
