## A.6.RCD - Needed Relation Claim Derivation and Relation-Kind Admission

> **Type:** Kernel relation-foundation pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

**Plain name.** Derive the needed relation claim before admitting a relation kind.

### A.6.RCD:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when an engineer can name the exact participant referents and the claim, check, decision, or continuation that is blocked, but no current direct relation states the needed relation-bearing claim.

Typical first-minute situations are:

- several governed relation facts seem to imply the needed claim, but `related to` or a convenient verb hides how;
- a formula, query path, graph edge, or rule appears to define the answer, and the team is about to treat it as a relation kind;
- the same compound claim recurs and the team needs to decide whether to keep deriving it locally, publish reusable predicate semantics, or admit a relation kind;
- a proposed primitive relation appears to be only a composition, projection, closure, aggregation, or cross-algebra juxtaposition of existing claims.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** One exact needed relation-bearing claim for one named receiving use. The application also settles whether that claim remains local, receives a reusable predicate-definition episteme, or justifies a derived or primitive relation kind. This wording does not mint a `NeededRelationClaim` kind or an application-record kind.

**First useful move.** Write the blocked receiving use and the participant meanings in ordinary domain language. Then use `A.6.P` to recover the current direct governing pattern and predicate and ask whether that predicate can already state the needed affirmative, negative, or exact governed modal claim for those participants. If current facts or history do not decide that predicate, keep the direct question open and route information sufficiency or reliance to the exact evaluation or evidence owner. Derive a compound predicate only when no current direct predicate can express the needed claim.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A team either leaves the claim as vague connective prose or promotes a formula, query, graph path, definition, or convenient name into ontology. The first loses replayable meaning. The second invents relation kinds without an obtaining law or occurrence identity.

**What this buys.** The engineer gets the lightest sufficient result: an existing direct relation, a local compound claim, reusable predicate-definition content with an optional separately admitted derived relation kind, or a genuinely irreducible primitive relation kind. The ontology grows only when the receiving use needs occurrence semantics that claim content alone cannot supply.

**Ordinary non-use boundary.** Do not use this pattern when a current direct governing predicate can already state the needed affirmative, negative, or exact governed modal claim; write that claim under the direct pattern and stop. A negative, hypothetical, forecast, or governed modal claim needs no obtaining relation occurrence. When available facts do not decide the direct predicate, leave that question open and assess information sufficiency, support, or reliance under the exact evaluation or evidence owner; `unresolved` is not a direct relation-claim polarity. Do not use A.6.RCD for wording-only cleanup, mathematical-lens adequacy, naming, evidence, assurance, or publication questions. `E.10`, `C.29`, `F.18`, `A.10`, `B.3`, and `E.17` govern those questions respectively.

**Cheap stop.** If a readable current direct relation closes the receiving use, stop before constructing a compound claim. If a local compound claim closes it, stop before publishing a reusable definition. If a reusable definition closes it, stop before admitting a relation kind.

### A.6.RCD:1 - Problem Frame

FPF permits rich claims over already governed entities and relations without requiring one primitive relation kind for every useful sentence. The difficult case begins after relational precision restoration: the participants are recoverable, the receiving use is real, and simpler direct relations exist, but no one current direct relation carries the needed claim.

The ordinary result of this pattern is claim content in a `C.2.1` episteme. Deriving that content is not the constitution of an actual relation occurrence. Repeated use can justify reusable predicate-definition content. Only a further occurrence-semantics need can justify a derived relation kind, and only irreducible action-facing semantics can justify a primitive relation kind.

### A.6.RCD:2 - Problem

Two errors compete.

1. **Under-definition.** `Related to`, `fulfils`, `enacts`, `reachable`, `supports`, or another convenient phrase hides the base facts, participant meanings, polarity, intermediate participants, applicability, or rule by which the claim follows.
2. **Premature admission.** A repeated expression, formula, query, graph path, table row, definition, or name is treated as a relation kind or relation occurrence although no direct subject settlement states obtaining and occurrence identity.

Authors MUST preserve expressive claims while preventing representation-created ontology and primitive-kind inflation.

### A.6.RCD:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension to resolve |
| --- | --- |
| Exact semantics vs readable use | Authors MUST make each conforming derivation replayable without making every practitioner read formal notation. |
| Local affordability vs repeated reuse | One local claim should stay cheap; repeated semantics should not be copied inconsistently. |
| Expressive claims vs small ontology | FPF should permit compound truths without minting one kind per compound predicate. |
| Reuse vs hidden dependencies | Reusable definitions need visible base-relation and substrate editions. |
| Truth conditions vs occurrence semantics | A predicate can be satisfied without supplying a way to reidentify relation occurrences. |
| Formal power vs substrate authority | Constructor names are available only where the selected substrate gives them semantics. |
| Mathematical representation vs ontology | A formula, path, graph, or query can represent a rule without making that rule obtain in the world. |

### A.6.RCD:4 - Solution

Name the blocked receiving claim and participants. Reuse a current direct governing predicate when it can state that claim. Derive only what the selected substrate warrants. Publish reusable predicate semantics only for repeated use. Admit a relation kind only with its direct obtaining and occurrence-identity laws. Stop when the receiving use works.

#### A.6.RCD:4.1 - Execute the demand-first method

1. **Name the receiver.** State the exact claim, check, decision, or continuation that cannot proceed, and what answer would close it.
2. **Recover participants and direct relations.** Use `A.6.P` to name the actual participant referents under their relation-participant meanings and retrieve the smallest plausible base from direct governing patterns and their obtaining laws. Similar tokens, shared field names, or adjacent graph edges are not a base.
3. **Choose the least constructor admitted by the current substrate.** State the constructor semantics and the base claim content it consumes. Do not infer an operator from punctuation or notation.
4. **Replay three things.** Test one positive case, one discriminating failure case, and the named receiving use. Keep hidden intermediates, polarity, scope, time, and base-definition editions visible when they change the result.
5. **Select the lightest disposition.** Choose exactly one of the four dispositions in section 4.3 and stop at its stopping rule.
6. **Open reusable semantics only when repeated use needs the same rule.** First decide whether every reuse concerns one exact subject or the parameterized rule is reused across several subject instances. For one subject, identify a subject-bounded compound-law episteme whose exact `EntityOfConcern` is that subject and state the reuse limit. For a rule reused across subject instances, identify the exact reusable predicate definition as `EntityOfConcern`; that episteme may satisfy A.6.0 `U.Signature` membership before any relation kind is admitted, but it is not a `RelationSignature`.
7. **Open kind admission only when occurrence semantics are consumed.** A derived kind needs a direct subject settlement with obtaining, applicability, base dependencies, and a non-optional occurrence-identity rule. A primitive candidate additionally carries the failed derivation, the exact action-facing distinction lost, its own obtaining and recurrence laws, independent receiving uses, and a standalone governing-pattern obligation.

#### A.6.RCD:4.2 - Respect substrate authority

A constructor probe is usable only when the selected substrate defines its inputs, output claim, applicability, and relevant laws. The following table is a non-exhaustive set of recurring single-substrate semantic probes. It is neither a universal operator registry nor a claim that any substrate supports the whole list.

| Recurring single-substrate semantic probe | Minimum semantics to recover | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| typed restriction | the base predicate, restricted participant kind or condition, and scope | a narrower claim is not automatically a new relation kind |
| participant permutation or converse | participant correspondence, polarity, and whether the direct subject ontology treats the inverse reading as the same occurrence | syntax does not decide occurrence identity |
| composition | the two or more base predicates, exact shared participant, order or direction, and intermediate witness policy | a hidden intermediate does not disappear from semantics because a query projects it away |
| projection | the source claim, retained participants, hidden participants, and existential or other projection law | projection can yield claim content without yielding an occurrence-identity rule |
| conjunction | all conjuncts, their common applicability, and one truth condition for the compound claim | co-truth does not create a cross-subject relation kind |
| negation or complement | the substrate's closed-world, open-world, constructive, probabilistic, or other negation law | absence of a base assertion is not automatically a negative relation fact |
| transitive or path closure | admitted edge relation, direction, path rule, zero-length policy, cycle policy, and subject structure | a graph path is a representation or witness; it is not the obtaining relation occurrence |
| aggregation | the population or collection, grouping rule, aggregated value, aggregation operator, empty or duplicate treatment, scope, and applicability | an aggregate or scalar summary does not silently become a relation predicate or occurrence |
| probabilistic operator | the event or sample space, random variables or events, probability operator or model, conditioning, threshold or decision rule, applicability, and uncertainty boundary | a probability, likelihood, or posterior does not silently become a relation predicate, and shared event labels do not bridge algebras |

**Cross-algebra claim-use boundary.** Ask how the named decision or work occurrence actually uses each result. For every consumed result, state its own obtaining premise-use, reference-use, decision-use, or other direct use relation under the receiving pattern. If the decision is one actual application of a declared operation, an exact A.6.1 argument binding may state that use instead. If neither a direct subject relation nor a truthful A.6.1 binding governs the use, return the exact missing-governor blocker; co-publication, a shared topic, or one decision record supplies no use relation.

Stop there when those independent uses close the receiver. Open a separate joint predicate only when the decision genuinely depends on a joint condition that the independent use relations cannot express; then name that condition and use A.6.RCD to derive exactly it. Do not add a generic joint-use relation or record merely because one decision cites results from two algebras.

When any consumed result also crosses `U.BoundedContext`s or ReferencePlanes, cite for that result the applicable `F.9` Bridge id, `CL`, Loss Notes, admitted-use statement, and the applicable ReferencePlane policy pin when planes differ. F.9 governs the declared alignment and its admitted cross-context use; it creates neither the receiving-use relation nor a joint predicate. Any assurance penalty from that crossing reduces only `B.3` `R_eff`; it does not change `F` or `G`. One same-context and same-plane use and one local single-substrate derivation require no fictitious Bridge.

A local compound claim needs recoverable constructor semantics, but it does not need a separately materialized substrate document. Authors MUST name and pin the substrate when the derivation is nontrivial, intended for interoperability, used as proof, or becomes a reusable predicate definition. If no current substrate supplies the proposed operator, return a missing-substrate blocker rather than improvising a universal constructor algebra.

#### A.6.RCD:4.3 - Select one of four dispositions

| Disposition | Test | Result | Stop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Existing direct governing predicate** | One current direct pattern already supplies the participant meanings, obtaining predicate, applicability, and claim family needed by the receiver. | State the readable affirmative, negative, or exact governed modal claim in a claim-bearing episteme under that owner. The direct pattern defines the test; current case facts or constituting history supply its factual basis. If they do not decide the test, leave the direct question open and return information sufficiency or reliance to its exact evaluation or evidence owner. | Stop. Do not derive a synonym predicate or duplicate relation kind. Only when an adequately grounded affirmative case satisfies the predicate is there an obtaining occurrence; open A.6.REL only when a receiver consumes that occurrence's identity. |
| **2. Local compound relation-bearing claim** | A substrate-admitted composition of governed base predicates closes this one receiving use, and no repeated definition or occurrence semantics is needed. | Put positive or negative compound claim content in one identified `C.2.1` episteme. An unresolved information-sufficiency or reliance assessment stays with the evaluation or evidence pattern; it is not a third predicate value. | Stop. Introduce no relation kind, `RelationSignature`, or `U.Relation` occurrence. |
| **3. Reusable predicate semantics, with derived-kind continuation only when needed** | Several uses need the same parameterized rule. If they all concern one exact subject, the rule is subject-bounded; if the rule is reused across subject instances, it is a genuinely reusable predicate definition. | Publish one C.2.1 episteme with the truthful branch-specific `EntityOfConcern`: the exact subject for a subject-bounded compound law, or the exact reusable predicate definition for cross-subject reuse. The latter may independently satisfy A.6.0 `U.Signature` membership. If a receiving use also needs stable relation-occurrence semantics, return a derived-kind candidate plus its proposed direct subject settlement and route that candidate to `E.24` and `E.24.UK`, and to `A.11` when parsimony is current. | Stop at the selected definition unless occurrence semantics are named and the proposed settlement is supplied. A definition is not a kind. A.6.0 membership does not make it a `RelationSignature`; only an admitted relation kind opens that specialization. |
| **4. Primitive relation kind** | Every accepted derivation loses one exact action-facing distinction, and the candidate has independent receiving uses plus its own obtaining, recurrence, applicability, and occurrence-identity laws. | Carry the candidate to `A.11`, `E.24`, and `E.24.UK`, and author a standalone direct subject pattern. | Stop or block if the failed derivation, lost distinction, independent use, direct pattern, or identity law is absent. A convenient name never passes this test. |

These are economy dispositions, not maturity stages. Later need can reopen a local claim or definition. The four dispositions do not impose a required maturity ladder on any application.

#### A.6.RCD:4.4 - Keep the governed objects distinct

Keep the order visible: the admitted relation kind classifies; its direct predicate defines the test; current case facts or constituting history determine whether that test is satisfied, failed, or still open; a claim-bearing episteme states an affirmative, negative, or exact governed modal claim; and an obtaining world-side occurrence exists only in a satisfied affirmative case. When the facts do not decide the predicate, information sufficiency, support, or reliance is evaluated by its exact owner rather than encoded as another direct polarity. A.6.REL opens explicit occurrence individuation only when a receiver consumes identity.

| Object | What it is | What it is not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| admitted direct relation kind | the independently governed classificatory distinction over its possible obtaining occurrences | not the direct predicate, one case result, an assertion, or an occurrence |
| direct obtaining predicate | the direct owner's test for named participant meanings under declared applicability | not proof that the test is satisfied in this case and not an occurrence |
| direct relation-bearing assertion | one `C.2.1` episteme whose exact claim family states affirmative, negative, or exact governed modal content about the predicate for named participants | not the world-side obtaining result and not an information-sufficiency or reliance disposition |
| obtaining direct relation occurrence | one world-side relation occurrence for which current case facts or constituting history satisfy the direct predicate; its direct identity rule exists even when no receiver needs an explicit designator | not created by the assertion, evidence, a representation, or an identifier |
| local compound relation-bearing claim | claim content in one `C.2.1` episteme, asserting or denying satisfaction of a substrate-admitted compound predicate | not a relation kind and not a relation occurrence |
| subject-bounded compound-law episteme | one `C.2.1` episteme whose exact `EntityOfConcern` is the promise-content edition, subject structure, decision occurrence, or other exact subject to which the rule is explicitly limited | not a predicate definition reusable across subject instances, not a `RelationSignature`, and not a classifier of relation occurrences |
| reusable predicate-definition episteme | one `C.2.1` episteme whose exact `EntityOfConcern` is the reusable predicate definition itself and whose claims define its parameterized semantics across subject instances | may satisfy A.6.0 `U.Signature` membership, but is not a `RelationSignature` before relation-kind admission and does not classify relation occurrences |
| admitted derived relation kind | a classificatory distinction over relation occurrences, with obtaining defined through governed base relations | not the definition episteme; it needs its own direct subject settlement and identity rule |
| admitted primitive relation kind | a classificatory distinction whose needed action-facing semantics cannot be preserved by accepted derivation | not a reward for a familiar word or notation |
| claim or derivation representation | formula tokens, formula trees, query paths, graph elements, tables, diagrams, or other `C.29` representation elements | not satisfaction, obtaining, admission, or occurrence identity |
| designator or governed reference | a name or reference associated with an already settled definition episteme, relation kind, or individuated occurrence | not one token that silently creates or identifies all three |

#### A.6.RCD:4.5 - Settle a reusable predicate definition truthfully

When the same rule is used more than once, first ask where the reuse actually travels.

- **One exact subject.** If every use asks about the same promise-content edition, subject structure, decision occurrence, or other exact subject, identify a subject-bounded compound-law episteme whose `EntityOfConcern` is that subject. State plainly that the rule may be reused only for claims about that subject; a familiar formula does not make it portable to another subject.
- **Across subject instances.** If the same parameterized rule is applied to several independently identified subjects, identify one reusable predicate-definition episteme whose `EntityOfConcern` is the exact predicate definition itself. If its claim graph supplies the subject and value range, Vocabulary, Laws, and Applicability required by A.6.0, the already identified episteme may satisfy `U.Signature` membership without relation-kind admission. It remains a predicate-definition declaration, not a `RelationSignature` or a classifier of occurrences.

In either branch, the definition content states:

- parameter and participant meanings;
- the exact base-relation claims and their direct governing patterns;
- the derivation rule under the selected substrate;
- polarity, scope, time, and applicability;
- base-definition and substrate dependencies plus their editions when current;
- positive and discriminating cases;
- the admissible claim use and the non-admissible occurrence or ontology overread.

If neither the exact subject nor the exact reusable predicate definition is the truthful `EntityOfConcern`, keep the needed results as local compound claims. Do not manufacture a union concern or alternate opportunistically between the rule and a nearby domain subject.

#### A.6.RCD:4.6 - Prepare derived or primitive relation-kind admission only with occurrence semantics

When a named receiver consumes occurrence semantics, A.6.RCD returns a relation-kind candidate and the settlement material needed for admission: a derived-kind candidate plus its proposed direct subject settlement, or a primitive-kind candidate plus its candidate standalone direct pattern. `E.24` and `E.24.UK` decide admission; `A.11` decides parsimony when that question is current. Neither a proposed settlement nor a candidate direct pattern admits the kind. For a candidate that is admitted, the resulting direct subject settlement states:

1. the classified relation occurrences and exact participant meanings;
2. the obtaining predicate and applicability;
3. for a derived kind, the exact derivation law and base-definition dependencies;
4. a direct occurrence-identity rule that distinguishes repetition;
5. recurrence, cessation, and continuation conditions when those distinctions matter;
6. at least one named receiving use that consumes occurrence semantics;
7. the standalone direct governing pattern.

An admitted relation kind never has `identity intentionally absent`. Ordinary use can omit explicit individuation, occurrence records, and designators because no receiver consumes them; the direct identity rule still exists.

A pure converse preserves one base occurrence only when the direct subject ontology explicitly says that inverse wording concerns the same occurrence. Restriction, projection, composition, closure, aggregation, and hidden intermediates require an explicit identity decision. Their syntax does not decide whether the derived occurrence inherits one base identity, is constituted as a composite occurrence, or has a new direct identity rule. If no truthful rule is available, remain at local-claim or predicate-definition level.

Before relation-kind admission, authors MAY ask A.6.0 whether a genuinely reusable predicate-definition episteme satisfies ordinary `U.Signature` membership. That declaration's `EntityOfConcern` is the exact predicate definition, not a candidate relation kind, and the result neither classifies occurrences nor admits a kind.

Authors MAY publish under A.6.0 a `RelationSignature` whose `EntityOfConcern` is an exact relation kind only after that kind is admitted. The `RelationSignature` declares reusable SlotSpecs and restates the direct laws; it does not admit the kind or make an occurrence obtain.

#### A.6.RCD:4.7 - Separate recognition from assurance

**Recognition branch for ordinary receiving use.** Ask only:

1. What receiving claim or action is blocked?
2. Who or what are the exact participants, and under which meanings?
3. Does one current direct governing predicate already state the needed affirmative, negative, or exact governed modal claim?
4. If not, what smallest substrate-admitted compound claim answers it?
5. Which of the four dispositions lets the receiver proceed now?

The ordinary branch can stop at a readable direct claim or one readable compound claim. It does not require a named substrate document, predicate-definition publication, new relation kind, signature, explicit occurrence, or designator when the receiving use consumes none of them.

**Negative direct-claim case.** A staffing check asks whether `Robot_7` holds `InspectorRole` in `Cell_3` during `Interval_T`. The current A.2.1 participant meanings and predicate govern the question. If the current assignment facts show that the predicate is false, one claim-bearing episteme states the negative result and disposition 1 closes the check; there is no obtaining assignment occurrence to individuate. If the available facts do not decide the predicate, leave the direct assignment question open. An exact evaluation or evidence owner may then return an information-sufficiency or reliance disposition; that disposition is neither a negative assignment fact nor a third direct polarity.

**Assurance branch for DPF and FPF authors.** DPF and FPF authors use this branch whenever they author a compound claim, reusable predicate definition, or relation-kind admission candidate, including a durable local compound claim that stops at disposition 2. In addition, verify:

- exact base patterns, definitions, editions, and applicability;
- selected substrate and constructor semantics;
- positive case, discriminating failure case, and receiving-use replay;
- one truthful definition `EntityOfConcern` when reusable semantics are published;
- dependency and currentness conditions;
- direct occurrence-identity and recurrence rules for every admitted relation kind;
- representation correspondence without representation-to-world collapse;
- naming only after the exact definition episteme, kind, or occurrence is settled;
- evidence, assurance, gate, and decision claims under their own governing patterns.

Passing the assurance branch does not make evidence constitutive of relation obtaining. It makes the derivation and admission decision replayable for the declared use.

#### A.6.RCD:4.8 - Stop and return deliberately

Stop at the first disposition that closes the named receiving use. Return to this pattern when:

- a relied-on base relation or predicate definition changes;
- the selected substrate edition or constructor semantics changes;
- applicability, polarity, participant meaning, scope, time, or hidden-intermediate policy changes;
- the derivation becomes unreadable, computationally unsuitable, or unable to interoperate for the declared use;
- repeated consumers begin to need one reusable definition or stable occurrence identity;
- a purported primitive gains an accepted lossless derivation, or a derived kind loses a truthful identity rule.

`G.11` governs currentness, dependency closure, and scoped refresh when a relied-on base definition, substrate edition, or applicability settlement changes. Re-evaluate only affected claims and dependent kinds; do not rebuild a global relation registry.

### A.6.RCD:5 - Archetypal Grounding — Worked Cases

#### A.6.RCD:5.1 - Promise-content fulfilment: use the existing direct A.2.3 predicate

**Situation.** `PromiseContent_Housing42_v3` says that exact housing `Housing_42` must be delivered to `AssemblyCell_B` during `Interval_42`, satisfy `OutcomeSpec_Housing42_v3`, and satisfy the acceptance predicate in `AcceptanceSpec_Housing42_v3`. The actual delivery work is the independently identified `U.Work` occurrence `Work_DeliverHousing42`; it is not the delivered entity, the post-delivery state, the evaluation, or the acceptance result.

**Direct owner and required subset.** A.2.3 already supplies the direct predicate `fulfilsPromiseContent(W, SC)`, so disposition 1 is available. For this exact promise-content edition, the necessary and sufficient world-side subset is:

1. `PromiseContentUse(Work_DeliverHousing42, PromiseContent_Housing42_v3, Interval_42)` obtains;
2. `PromisedOutcomeDeliveryRelation(Work_DeliverHousing42, OutcomeSpec_Housing42_v3)` obtains because the selected work facts, exact delivered entity `Housing_42`, and its post-delivery state satisfy that OutcomeSpec; and
3. the acceptance predicate in `AcceptanceSpec_Housing42_v3` is satisfied for those exact facts and states.

No production or entity-inception claim is current because `Housing_42` already existed before this delivery work. This edition requires no additional generic transfer or institutional-acceptance relation beyond the two A.2.3 relations and its acceptance predicate. If another edition requires one, it must name that exact direct relation and its participants rather than adding a `delivery work` bundle.

**Evaluation, result, and evidence.** Separate evaluation work `Work_InspectHousing42` applies the declared acceptance method. Its exact operation-result binding carries the verdict value; optional episteme `InspectionVerdict_Housing42` states that evaluation result. An A.10 evidence-use relation may support reliance on the affirmative fulfilment assertion. The evaluation work, result binding, verdict episteme, and evidence-use relation neither become parts of `Work_DeliverHousing42` nor make `PromiseContentFulfilmentRelation` obtain. The three world-side conditions above make the direct relation obtain; evaluation and evidence only support an assertion about it.

**Positive case.** All three required conditions above are satisfied, so the direct predicate is satisfied and a claim-bearing episteme may state `fulfilsPromiseContent(Work_DeliverHousing42, PromiseContent_Housing42_v3)` without creating the occurrence.

**Discriminating failures.** `Work_DeliverHousing42` can occur and `Housing_42` can be in the target post-state while `PromiseContentUse` is absent or concerns another promise edition; then `PromisedOutcomeDeliveryRelation` for this promised outcome does not obtain and the promise is not fulfilled. Or the delivery relation can obtain while one acceptance condition is false; an `accepted` label or report cannot repair that failure. Missing evidence leaves reliance on the assertion unresolved; it creates neither fulfilment nor non-fulfilment.

**Disposition and stop.** Stop at disposition 1 under A.2.3. No new compound-law episteme, predicate definition, relation kind, or `RelationSignature` is needed. Open A.6.REL only if a later receiver must distinguish this fulfilment occurrence from another occurrence of the same admitted relation.

#### A.6.RCD:5.2 - Role enactment: one local compound claim

**Situation.** A work record needs the readable claim that a holder enacted an assigned role in one exact work occurrence.

**Base and derivation.** Recover the obtaining `U.RoleAssignment`, the holder's exact participation in the work, the work occurrence, and the direct relation that makes that work relevant to the assigned role. State the local compound claim in one `C.2.1` episteme whose exact `EntityOfConcern` is the `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence under concern; neither the work-record wording, holder, work occurrence, nor a union of nearby objects substitutes for that concern.

**Positive case.** The same admitted `U.System` that holds the role assignment participates in the qualifying work while the assignment obtains and the work satisfies the direct role-relevance condition.

**Discriminating failure.** The assignment obtains, but another system performs the work, or the named holder performs work outside the assignment or outside the relevant work relation. Assignment plus nearby work is therefore insufficient.

**Disposition and stop.** Disposition 2. Keep the readable local enactment claim; admit no universal `RoleEnactment` kind, occurrence, or `RelationSignature`. If a later subject pattern demonstrates repeated occurrence-semantics need, reopen that exact subject case rather than generalizing from the verb.

#### A.6.RCD:5.3 - Supply-chain reachability: subject-bounded query or reusable predicate definition

**Situation.** One planner asks whether `Supplier_A` can reach `Plant_B` inside `SupplyNetwork_North_2026`. Other planners want the same directed-reachability rule for independently identified supply-network structures.

**Base and derivation.** Name the direct edge-relation kinds, direction, structure parameter, source and target parameters, path or closure rule, zero-length and cycle policies, applicability, and edge-definition editions. A one-off answer is a local compound claim. Repeated queries only about `SupplyNetwork_North_2026` may use a subject-bounded compound-law episteme whose `EntityOfConcern` is that exact structure and whose reuse boundary excludes other structures. When the same parameterized rule is reused across independently identified structures, publish `DirectedReachabilityPredicate_v1` as a predicate-definition episteme whose `EntityOfConcern` is that exact reusable definition. If its claim graph supplies A.6.0's subject and value range, Vocabulary, Laws, and Applicability, it may independently satisfy ordinary `U.Signature` membership without becoming a `RelationSignature`.

**Positive case.** A path exists whose every edge is an obtaining occurrence of the admitted base relation under the selected structure and closure rule.

**Discriminating failure.** A graph representation contains a visual or stored path, but one edge points in the wrong direction, denotes a different base relation, or belongs to a superseded structure edition. Representation connectivity therefore does not satisfy the reachability predicate.

**Disposition and stop.** The one-off query stops at disposition 2. Repeated use confined to one exact structure stops at disposition 3's subject-bounded branch. Cross-structure reuse stops at disposition 3's reusable predicate-definition branch and may add ordinary A.6.0 `U.Signature` membership. If a subject practice later needs reachability occurrences with action-facing identity, recurrence, continuation, or participation in another relation, A.6.RCD returns a derived reachability-kind candidate plus a proposed direct subject settlement; `E.24` and `E.24.UK` decide admission, with `A.11` applied when parsimony is current. Only an admitted relation kind opens `RelationSignature`. Path identity, query-result-row identity, predicate-definition identity, subject-structure identity, and relation-occurrence identity are not interchangeable.

#### A.6.RCD:5.4 - Formal and probabilistic result use: preserve separate algebras

**Situation.** One engineering decision-work occurrence consumes one formal result episteme and one probabilistic result episteme.

**Base and derivation.** Keep the formal result in its formal substrate and the probabilistic result in its probability substrate. State the two separately governed result-use assertions in one `C.2.1` episteme whose exact `EntityOfConcern` is the engineering decision-work occurrence. The formal and probabilistic result epistemes remain distinct used results; neither their pair nor a union of nearby objects replaces that concern.

No `F.9` Bridge is needed for this case as stated: the two result epistemes enter the decision through separately governed direct use relations, while neither claim content nor algebraic meaning is transported across a `U.BoundedContext` or ReferencePlane or combined into one predicate.

**Positive case.** Both direct use relations obtain for the decision-work occurrence under their own applicability, so the decision rationale can cite each result for its admitted use.

**Discriminating failure.** The two results are co-published or mention the same subject, but the decision work has no governed use relation to one of them. Shared carrier, topic, or notation does not establish decision use.

**Disposition and stop.** The apparent combined need decomposes into two independently governed receiving claims. Each closes under disposition 1 with its exact direct decision-use relation. Do not publish a cross-algebra conjunction predicate merely to join the sentences, and do not infer one composite relation occurrence from a decision record.

#### A.6.RCD:5.5 - Primitive-candidate stop test

A subject practice proposes a primitive relation because all accepted bases preserve co-occurrence and shared participants but lose one independently used subject distinction. The candidate advances only when the subject can name that lost distinction, show a positive and discriminating case, state its own obtaining and recurrence laws, distinguish repeated occurrences, and identify independent receiving uses. If any item is missing, the honest result is a local claim, reusable predicate definition, or exact blocker. This is disposition 4's positive test, not a license to mint a placeholder relation.

### A.6.RCD:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern corrects primitive-kind bias: a useful repeated phrase or representation can look ontologically important before its governed claim and occurrence semantics are recovered. It also corrects false-parsimony bias: if every accepted derivation loses a distinction that changes real work and the subject supplies its own obtaining and identity laws, refusing the primitive would hide needed ontology.

The formal examples can bias authors toward syntax-first reasoning. The method therefore begins from the blocked receiving use, direct participants, and direct relations. The ordinary branch stays readable; formal apparatus appears only when it changes replay, reuse, proof, interoperability, or admission.

### A.6.RCD:7 - Conformance Checklist

1. **Blocked receiver.** The exact claim, check, decision, or continuation under repair is named.
2. **Participants first.** Actual referents and relation-participant meanings are recovered before constructor or notation choice.
3. **Direct-predicate stop.** `A.6.P` recovers the current direct governing pattern and predicate before compound derivation begins. If that predicate can state the needed affirmative, negative, or exact governed modal claim, use it and stop; an obtaining occurrence is not a prerequisite for negative or governed modal content. If case facts do not decide the predicate, leave the direct question open and route information sufficiency, support, or reliance to the exact evaluation or evidence owner.
4. **Governed base.** Every base predicate names its direct governing pattern and obtaining law. The current case separately supplies the relevant facts or constituting history; an assertion or representation does not turn that rule into an obtaining occurrence.
5. **Substrate authority.** Every used constructor has semantics in the selected substrate; nontrivial, interoperable, proof-bearing, or reusable derivation pins the substrate and edition.
6. **Replay.** One positive case, one discriminating failure case, and the receiving-use replay agree.
7. **Lightest disposition.** Exactly one of the four dispositions closes the current use; later branches are not opened by habit.
8. **Claim polarity and occurrence boundary.** Direct and compound assertions may be affirmative, negative, or governed modal claims; information sufficiency, support, or reliance is evaluated separately and is not a third predicate value. The direct owner defines the test, current case facts or constituting history determine its satisfaction, and the assertion states the result without creating an occurrence. Open A.6.REL only when a satisfied affirmative case has an occurrence whose identity a receiver consumes.
9. **Definition identity and reuse boundary.** A subject-bounded compound-law episteme names the exact subject as its `EntityOfConcern` and states that reuse does not travel to another subject. A genuinely reusable predicate-definition episteme names the exact reusable predicate definition as its `EntityOfConcern`. Both state exact applicability and visible base dependencies.
10. **Definition/signature boundary.** A genuinely reusable predicate-definition episteme may satisfy ordinary A.6.0 `U.Signature` membership before relation-kind admission. It is not a `RelationSignature`, does not classify relation occurrences, and does not make one obtain.
11. **Derived-kind candidate and admission.** When a named receiver needs stable occurrence semantics, A.6.RCD returns a derived-kind candidate plus a proposed direct subject settlement covering derivation and dependencies, obtaining, applicability, recurrence where current, and a direct occurrence-identity rule. `E.24` and `E.24.UK` decide admission; `A.11` decides parsimony when current. Neither the proposal nor its direct subject pattern admits the kind. Only an admitted relation kind proceeds to an A.6.0 `RelationSignature`; ordinary `U.Signature` membership of a predicate-definition episteme is independent of that route.
12. **Primitive-kind settlement.** A primitive candidate records the failed derivation, exact action-facing loss, independent uses, own obtaining and identity laws, and standalone direct pattern before A.11/E.24/E.24.UK admission can pass.
13. **Identity never absent.** Explicit individuation can be omitted from ordinary use; an admitted relation kind's identity rule cannot.
14. **Representation boundary.** Formula, query, graph, tree, path, diagram, row, and name remain representations or designators connected to independently recovered content.
15. **Neighboring claims.** Evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, publication, naming, and currentness use their direct governing patterns.
16. **Stop or return.** The result states the current stop and the exact dependency or use change that would reopen it.

### A.6.RCD:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Failure | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RelatedTo` as a universal fallback | Vague wording substitutes for participants and predicate. | Name the blocked receiver and derive the smallest governed claim. |
| Formula-as-fact | A formula tree or theorem token is treated as predicate satisfaction. | Recover the claim and its applicability; keep the formula under `C.29`. |
| Query-path ontology | A path match is treated as an obtaining relation occurrence. | Separate base-edge obtaining, closure semantics, query result, and any later occurrence identity. |
| Definition-as-kind | A reusable episteme is treated as a classifier of occurrences. | Keep its one `EntityOfConcern` and claim content; run separate derived-kind admission only for an occurrence-semantics need. |
| Kind-by-name | A good relation name is treated as admission evidence. | Use `F.18` only after the exact definition episteme, kind, or occurrence is settled. |
| Identity intentionally absent | An admitted kind has truth conditions but no occurrence identity because current prose does not expose occurrences. | Supply the direct identity rule or remain at claim or definition level. |
| Universal constructor algebra | Restriction, negation, closure, probability, and cross-algebra conjunction are assumed to mean the same thing everywhere. | Use only operators supplied by the selected substrate; return a blocker otherwise. |
| Hidden intermediate erased | Projection removes an intermediate from notation and therefore from semantics. | State the shared participant and witness policy even when the receiving claim projects it away. |
| Cross-algebra conjunction | Formal and probabilistic results are merged because one decision uses both. | Keep each algebra and direct decision-use relation separate. |
| Primitive by exhaustion | Failure to find a derivation is treated as proof of irreducibility. | Record the searched governed base, exact lost distinction, positive and failure cases, and direct identity law; otherwise keep an exact blocker. |

### A.6.RCD:9 - Consequences

**Benefits.** FPF can state many exact compound claims without multiplying primitive relation kinds. Repeated subject semantics become reusable without confusing a definition with ontology. When occurrence semantics really matter, derived and primitive relation kinds enter with direct obtaining and identity laws rather than with syntax or names.

**Costs.** Authors MUST expose base dependencies and substrate semantics for nontrivial reuse. Authors of a direct subject pattern MUST supply the additional settlement content required by section 4.6 before a relation kind is admitted. Some familiar relation words remain local claims or exact blockers.

**Boundary.** This pattern reduces public primitive kinds and duplicate declarations; it does not reduce the number of true compound claims or obtaining base-relation facts.

### A.6.RCD:10 - Rationale

Claim composition and relation-kind admission answer different engineering questions. A claim asks whether an exact predicate, possibly built from governed base predicates, is satisfied for named referents. A relation kind classifies obtaining occurrences and therefore needs a rule for reidentifying those occurrences. Repetition of the first question can justify publication of the predicate rule; it does not answer the second.

The demand-first order is deliberately asymmetric. Existing direct relations are cheapest because their subject patterns already own obtaining and identity. Local compound claims preserve expressive reach without public ontology cost. Predicate-definition epistemes prevent repeated derivations from drifting. Derived relation kinds add occurrence semantics only where receivers consume them. Primitive relation kinds remain available for irreducible distinctions rather than being prohibited by abstract minimalism.

### A.6.RCD:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Practice or source line | What this pattern uses | What it rejects or bounds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| W3C [OWL 2 Structural Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/) inverse object properties and property-chain axioms | Typed inverse and composition examples constrain the substrate-authority test in 4.2 and the supply-chain reachability case in 5.3: direction, shared participants, and the selected chain law remain explicit. | An OWL axiom neither establishes FPF equivalence nor supplies world-side obtaining or occurrence identity; case 5.3 still stops at a local claim or predicate definition unless the subject practice separately supplies occurrence semantics. |
| [Alloy language reference](https://alloytools.org/spec.html) relational restriction, transpose, join, product, union, difference, and closure | This mature explicit-operator substrate constrains 4.2 and the supply-chain reachability replay in 5.3, including direction, closure, zero-length, and cycle policy. | Alloy syntax is not a universal FPF constructor algebra and does not admit relation kinds; case 5.3's kind branch remains stopped until a direct subject practice supplies action-facing occurrence semantics and identity. |
| W3C [SPARQL 1.1 Property Paths](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-property-paths/) | Query-local path and closure semantics for the reachability worked case. | A successful path query is not an obtaining relation occurrence and its result-row identity is not occurrence identity. |
| Florio and Linnebo, [Introduction to Constructional Ontology](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/fois2024/resources/papers/florio-linnebo-introduction-to-constructional-ontology.pdf), 2024, and Borgo and Righetti, [Towards Applied Constructional Ontology](https://doi.org/10.3233/FAIA250480), 2025 | Their constructor, input, process, and output-identity distinctions are adapted as a discriminating probe for the occurrence-semantics gate in 4.6 and the primitive-candidate stop in 5.5: authors MUST state in the candidate's direct subject rule which construction is identity-bearing. | A construction description or inherited source category neither constitutes FPF work or a relation occurrence nor admits a relation kind; 5.5 remains stopped until the direct subject practice supplies its own obtaining and identity law. |
| Chris Partridge, [BORO Ontology](https://borosolutions.net/boro-ontology), C-FORS 2025 presentation; current bounded extensional comparator | Its temporal-extent, recurrence, and ontology-evolution pressure is adapted for the occurrence-identity requirements in 4.6 and the primitive-candidate stop in 5.5: a temporal gap distinguishes repeated occurrences only when the direct subject rule adopts that discriminator. | FPF rejects universal 4D identity, unrestricted composition, and BORO category architecture. Reopen this bounded comparison if a later BORO edition or a direct FPF identity rule changes whether temporal extent is action-relevant for the 4.6/5.5 stop. |
| Almeida, Guizzardi, Sales, and Fonseca, [gUFO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.20948), 2026 preprint relation-reification comparison | Its differentiated relational-aspect and reification patterns stress the object boundary in 4.4 and the occurrence-identity and primitive-candidate stops in 4.6 and 5.5. | FPF adapts those distinctions as a current comparison but rejects an OWL class, property, reifier, or imported category hierarchy as proof of obtaining or occurrence identity; the candidate remains stopped until its direct subject rule supplies both. |

Reopen these source-use decisions when a selected substrate changes its operator semantics, a newer practice invalidates one of the representation boundaries, or a direct FPF relation pattern supplies a more action-capable derivation or identity rule without worse ontology truth, reader use, or modeling cost.

### A.6.RCD:12 - Reopen Conditions

Reopen the exact affected disposition, not the whole relation foundation, when:

- a base relation definition, participant meaning, obtaining law, or applicability changes;
- a substrate edition changes a constructor used by the claim;
- a local claim recurs enough to need one stable definition;
- a reusable definition gains or loses a truthful single `EntityOfConcern`;
- a receiver begins or ceases to need stable occurrence identity;
- an admitted derived kind loses a base dependency or identity rule;
- an admitted primitive gains a lossless derivation or loses its independent action-facing use;
- repeated reader error shows that the definition, kind, occurrence, representation, or designator is being confused.

### A.6.RCD:13 - Relations

- **Entered from:** `A.6.P` only after exact participants are recovered and no current direct relation closes the named receiving claim.
- **Builds on:** `A.6.REL` for relation obtaining and occurrence identity; `A.6.5` for participant declaration discipline; `C.2.1` for local claims and predicate-definition epistemes; and the direct subject patterns supplying base relations.
- **Coordinates with:** `A.11`, `E.24`, and `E.24.UK` for parsimony, ontic settlement, and durable admission; `A.6.0` for possible ordinary `U.Signature` membership of a genuinely reusable predicate-definition episteme before relation-kind admission, and for `RelationSignature` only after the exact relation kind is admitted; `C.29` for derivation representations; `F.9` for Bridge id, `CL`, loss, admitted-use, and plane-policy discipline when claims cross contexts or ReferencePlanes; `B.3` for any resulting `R_eff`-only assurance penalty; `F.18` for names and designators after settlement; and `G.11` for dependency currentness and scoped refresh.
- **Does not replace:** direct subject relation patterns, `A.6.P`, `E.24.UK`, `C.29`, `F.18`, evidence or assurance patterns, or work and decision patterns.
