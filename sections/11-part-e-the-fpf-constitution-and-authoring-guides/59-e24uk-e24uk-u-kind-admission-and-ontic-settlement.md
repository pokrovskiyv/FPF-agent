## E.24.UK - U-kind Admission and Ontic Settlement

> **Type:** Part E FPF authoring discipline pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless a section is explicitly informative

### E.24.UK:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when a public FPF expression proposes a `U.*`, type, kind, or subkind and the author must choose among four outcomes: reuse an admitted durable kind, declare a bounded C.3.2 local kind, admit a genuinely needed durable kind, or recover a non-kind object under the rule that defines or tests it. A title, filename, ToC row, table, or source spelling opens the question but never answers it.

Typical moments:

- a direct relation family has stable occurrence identity and patterns for the next questions need one common kind for those occurrences;
- a proposed `U.*` name appears in a pattern title, host filename, monolith heading, or ToC row;
- a current pattern uses type, kind, or subkind wording and the governed object is unclear;
- a structural name looks useful for search, but may advertise a false root kind;
- a `RelationSignature` SlotKind, an assertion or description field, a `C.29` representation element, or an `E.24.PUB` reusable form has acquired a `U.*` spelling;
- a single E.24 ontic settlement appears to govern one root U-kind plus several dependent durable U-kinds.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** Identify the exact object the admission decision is about before filling the card: an already recoverable C.3 `U.Kind`, the proposal episteme for an unadmitted distinction, or the source-construct entity being translated. Put the proposed criterion, candidate individuals, intended extent and non-member boundary, spelling, and dependent claims in the ClaimGraph. If no decision subject is identifiable, keep the inquiry open. An extension, member list, rule bundle, title, or spelling cannot fill this position.

**Primary working reader.** The first reader is an FPF pattern author or reviewer deciding whether a public FPF name should remain `U.*`. The downstream reader is the practitioner who uses public pattern titles, headings, ToC rows, and names as orientation cues and needs those cues to point to the real governed object.

**First useful move.** First name the exact local kind, proposal episteme, or source-construct entity that the decision is about; if no such object is identifiable, retain the inquiry and stop. Then recover the proposed governed individuals, identity or membership rule, intended extent and non-member boundary, and the action-facing claim that needs the kind. Test whether existing U-kinds, direct relations, declaration SlotKinds, C.3 local kinds, or selected structures already preserve that distinction. Judge the public spelling only after the admission disposition is stable.

**What goes wrong if missed.** FPF grows a shadow ontology by punctuation. A slot label becomes a kind, a publication form becomes an ontic, type and kind wording becomes active beside ontic settlement, and a useful title survives because it is searchable rather than because it names the governed object.

**What this buys.** Public `U.*` names become trustworthy. A candidate distinction either passes one explicit root or dependent admission test, or stays with the actual governed object and uses its defining or testing rule, with the PatternID kept only as a locator, without creating an umbrella kind.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If the question is whether FPF needs a durable ontic at all, use `E.24`.
- If the question is only detecting an ontic candidate before the durable decision, use `E.24.CD`.
- If the question is the difference among an ontic, its description episteme, publication, and publication form, use `E.24.PUB`.
- If the question is one phrase-level precision issue with no durable name pressure, use `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, or the direct precision-restoration pattern.
- If the current governed object is already recovered and only its public label must be chosen, use `F.8`, `F.5`, `F.18`, or `F.17` according to the naming use.

### E.24.UK:1 - Problem Frame

FPF reserves `U.*` names for admitted durable U-kinds. Current source material and older corpus passages can still place that spelling on a declaration-local SlotKind, participant designation, selected structure, publication form, representation element, or unsettled candidate. The spelling is therefore evidence of admission pressure, not evidence of admission.

Section 4.2 separates exact accepted admission-result references from open prerequisites, blocked candidates, and non-admission exits. A public spelling, owner citation, or orientation row supplies no admission by itself. Existing root and same-individual-dependent kinds remain usable only through the exact accepted result reference recorded there; `U.Capability` remains blocked on its missing dependence governor, and unresolved prerequisite kinds remain `unsettled` rather than being inherited by assertion.

E.24.UK governs this separation. A world-side relation participant keeps its independently governed kind; a `RelationSignature` SlotKind stays declaration-local; an assertion-side designation stays in its claim-bearing episteme; and a publication form or C.29 representation keeps its direct use. It is an E.24 subpattern because U-kind admission depends on ontic settlement, but it is not the head E.24 pattern. E.24 remains the head pattern for `U.Ontic` and ontic introduction. E.24.UK governs the detailed U-kind admission rules.

### E.24.UK:2 - Problem

Without this pattern:

1. **`U.*` spelling substitutes for admission.** A public name is retained because it looks like a kind.
2. **Unsettled type and kind wording competes with U-kind admission rules.** Type, kind, subkind, Concept-Set rows, U-kind names, and E.24 ontics become overlapping ontologies.
3. **A dependent distinction becomes an independent root.** A kind whose individuals retain root identity or depend on one root-kind individual is treated as if it had an independent root settlement.
4. **Structural names over-admit.** A title, filename, heading, ToC row, bounded-context label, system, team, subsystem, view, diagram, publication, or named use is treated as if it created a base `U.Structure` identity or specialization membership.
5. **Declaration and representation elements become U-kinds.** A participant meaning in a direct relation, a SlotKind in its reusable declaration, an assertion field, or a `C.29` representation element receives a `U.*` spelling even though its governing object is already known.
6. **Naming patterns are asked to do ontology.** F.5, F.8, F.18, or F.17 is used before the governed object has been recovered.

### E.24.UK:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Public mnemonic usefulness vs ontology truth | A `U.*` name can improve discovery; it can also advertise a false governed object. |
| Root stability vs dependent reuse | Some dependent distinctions deserve durable names but retain identity through one root settlement. |
| C.3 typed reasoning vs U-kind governance | Durable membership follows the admitted kind's direct predicate and dependent-kind laws. C.3 may project that result into a local typed use, but its local `U.Kind` and `U.SubkindOf` objects neither admit nor redefine the durable kind. |
| Kernel parsimony vs expressive pattern language | FPF needs useful names, but new U-kinds are expensive and must not replace slots and relations. |
| Host and ToC structure vs prose nuance | A false `U.*` in a title, filename, heading, or ToC row is stronger than a false prose occurrence. |

### E.24.UK:4 - Solution

Treat durable U-kind admission as a claim-bearing decision about one identified entity, not as a relation between a public name and a settlement and not as a bundle of future members, rules, boundaries, and uses. Select the decision's EntityOfConcern by the entry rule above; keep the proposed kind criterion, extent, spelling, and use-enabling claims in its ClaimGraph. Record the decision in a DRR or another claim-bearing episteme under `E.9`; the decision creates no project-side `U.Relation` occurrence.

The compact block below is a publication form for that decision episteme. Its labels prompt decision claims; they are not kind participants, SlotSpecs, or a project-side relation. Treat a filled block as the decision episteme only when its ClaimGraph, one exact EntityOfConcern selected by the entry rule, and effective ReferenceScheme are recoverable under C.2.1. A list of candidate members, rules, or names does not fill the EntityOfConcern field. Otherwise the block remains only a form prompt and no `AdmissionDisposition` may be relied on from it.

Every admitted durable U-kind points to one accepted `E24FamilySettlementDecision` result governed by `E.24:4.0a`; E.24.UK does not define a second compatibility test. For a newly admitted durable kind, that shared result establishes exactly one of these forms:

- a root U-kind for a governed subject whose identity and extent are given by one cited identity or membership rule;
- a same-individual dependent U-kind whose cited membership rule adds a stable condition to individuals already admitted under one root U-kind;
- an identity-dependent U-kind whose cited rule identifies a distinct individual through an exact dependence relation to one named root-kind individual plus every additional discriminator.

When no new durable U-kind is admitted, the same decision instead records `reuse` of an exact already admitted durable U-kind, `local-kind` under one exact C.3.2 declaration, or `reject` with the recovered non-kind object and its direct governor.

A public Tech label follows the admission decision through `F.18`. The spelling can improve retrieval, but it supplies neither the classified individuals nor their identity, membership, or extent. `U.Ontic` names the ontology-unit kind and does not replace the subject kind governed by that ontology unit.

Use this compact decision episteme when the admission is contested or load-bearing:

    EffectiveReferenceScheme:
```

`AdmissionDisposition` is the only disposition field.

- `E24SettlementRef` names an accepted settlement when one is reused. In an atomic co-decision it names the provisional settlement output of that same decision; neither output is accepted until both branches pass.
- Every positive admission cites the durable-membership rule and reference scheme. `same-individual-dependent` also cites its root, membership rule, and root-inclusion implication. `identity-dependent` instead cites one already governed dependence relation and all identity discriminators; if that relation is missing, stop.
- `reuse`, `local-kind`, and `reject` cite `ReusedUKindRef`, `LocalKindDeclarationRef`, or `RejectedCandidateRecoveryRef` respectively. A root closes only with the shared settlement, durable-membership rule, and PatternID that locates that rule.

The decision episteme is a claim-bearing object about the selected EntityOfConcern; its ClaimGraph describes the proposed and selected ontology settlement. It is not identical to that local kind, proposal episteme, or source construct, and it is not any individual classified by the proposed kind. `CandidateSpelling` and `NamingPatternIfAdmitted` remain optional claims because admission can be settled before the final public name.

#### E.24.UK:4.1 - Positive Test For A Durable U-kind

Test a proposed new durable U-kind against these eight conditions. It may receive `root`, `same-individual-dependent`, or `identity-dependent` only if all eight hold:

1. **Governed individuals.** The candidate classifies identifiable governed individuals, not source expressions, declaration fields, table columns, reference suffixes, publication forms, or mathematical representation elements.
2. **Stable identity or membership.** Cite an identity, grounding, recognition, or membership rule that reidentifies individuals and determines whether they enter the intended extent.
3. **Reviewable witness.** Cite the direct operational test. A relation-kind candidate cites the ClaimGraph that gives participant meanings, obtaining, applicability, and occurrence identity. If no current direct relation closes the claim, an `A.6.RCD` application may record a derived or primitive candidate with a proposed direct subject settlement; its local-claim and predicate-definition exits are not kind witnesses. Every other candidate cites its direct constructive, classificatory, or membership test. A signature, row, declaration, or mathematical trace counts only when its declaration or defining rule states the correspondence to the governed individuals.
4. **Action-facing need.** FPF users need to state, compare, constrain, transform, or otherwise reason about those individuals under this kind; a wording preference alone does not qualify.
5. **Non-duplication.** Existing U-kinds, direct relations, declaration SlotKinds, local C.3 kinds, and selected structures cannot preserve the needed distinction without this durable kind.
6. **Defining locus.** One primary rule passage or accepted governed source set states the kind's identity or membership, intended extent, admissible use, and non-use boundary.
7. **Shared E.24-family settlement.** Fill `E.24:4.0a` with the subject kind and identity rule, the smallest governed relation set needed by the named use, any identity-bearing relation selected by the current settlement decision, declarations actually reused, direct defining or testing rules, receiving use, and non-use and reopen boundaries. Also cite the durable-membership rule and scheme, the same-individual inclusion law or identity-dependence relation when applicable, and the exact result references. If both ontic and public kind are new, one atomic co-decision returns separate provisional outputs without circular premises.
8. **By-value dependence.** Current or selected downstream uses cite the kind by value rather than only repeating its label.

If any positive-admission condition fails, do not force the candidate into a durable root or dependent form. Select `reuse` when an admitted durable kind already covers the distinction, `local-kind` when bounded C.3.2 classification is sufficient, or `reject` when no classificatory distinction remains. Recover the exact direct relation, declaration component, selected structure, episteme, publication form, representation element, or source wording that carries the current claim. Only after disposition is settled may an author apply F.8, F.5, and F.18 naming criteria and constitute any public F.17 row.

#### E.24.UK:4.2 - Six Admission Dispositions

The typed `AdmissionDisposition` has exactly six values:

1. **`root`.** The candidate classifies individuals identified by one cited identity or membership rule whose extent and recognition conditions are explicit.
2. **`same-individual-dependent`.** The candidate classifies individuals already admitted under one root U-kind. The root pattern keeps individual identity; the dependent pattern adds a stable membership condition and an action-facing use. The accepted settlement also states the implication: if that same individual satisfies the dependent condition, it is a member of the named root kind.
3. **`identity-dependent`.** The candidate classifies a distinct individual whose identity cannot be stated without one named root-kind individual. The exact dependence relation between those two individuals and every additional discriminator must already have a defining rule. A holder or root reference without that relation does not close admission.
4. **`reuse`.** The needed individuals and distinction are already covered by one admitted durable U-kind. Reuse that exact kind and its cited identity or membership rule; do not admit a duplicate root or dependent kind.
5. **`local-kind`.** Record this non-admission exit only with one exact current C.3.2 declaration through `LocalKindDeclarationRef`. The distinction remains local under the C.3 family and does not become a root or dependent durable U-kind; E.24.UK does not restate the declaration's internal mechanics.
6. **`reject`.** No durable or local classificatory distinction survives recovery. Keep the exact relation, declaration component, selected structure, episteme, publication object, representation element, or source wording that carries the claim. A contingent qualification whose membership is only temporary participation in a relation belongs here; use Plain relation-defined wording when useful.

Only `root`, `same-individual-dependent`, and `identity-dependent` admit the candidate as a durable U-kind. `reuse`, `local-kind`, and `reject` are distinct exits, not weakened dependent admissions.

Read kind, individual, dependence, and part separately:

- `U.WorkPlan` is a kind name. `MaintenancePlan_Q3` is one individual that may be classified by that kind. The name is not the plan individual, and neither is a declaration slot or record field.
- Same-individual dependence adds membership, not another object. C.2.1 first identifies `MaintenancePlan_Q3` as one `U.Episteme`; when A.15.2's plan-membership predicate holds, that same episteme is also a `U.WorkPlan`. No second plan individual and no parthood claim follow.
- Identity dependence concerns two distinct individuals joined by a governed relation that contributes to one individual's identity. A capability and its holder system would need that relation. Current A.2.2 supplies a holder-indexed identity tuple but not the required capability-to-holder relation, so `U.Capability` remains blocked; a holder field or reference is not the missing relation.
- Dependence does not imply parthood. Even if a capability-to-holder dependence relation is governed later, that fact alone does not make the capability a part or characteristic of the holder system. A parthood conclusion needs its own direct part relation under A.1 and that relation's obtaining rule.

None of a kind name, membership, identity dependence, or parthood follows from another. When the contrast is kind versus instance, say **kind**, **individual**, **instance**, or **concrete governed object**, not bare **value**. Reserve slot-filler wording for actual declaration slots and record-field wording for records.

#### E.24.UK:4.2a - Durable Membership and C.3 Projection

Durable U-kind membership is separate from C.3 local-kind reasoning. For an independently identified candidate `x`, `x : K` holds exactly when the direct predicate `M_K` holds under the reference scheme in the accepted settlement; the extent of `K` is all such candidates. A row, spelling, record, or unresolved evaluation changes neither that predicate nor the world-side extent.

For `same-individual-dependent`, the settlement states `M_Kd(x) -> M_Kr(x)` and the same individual keeps root identity. For `identity-dependent`, the cited rule defines or constrains a two-place dependence relation from the distinct dependent individual to one exact root-kind individual, states when it obtains, and supplies every additional discriminator. A root reference alone closes neither form.

The current capability candidate still stops at the exact missing-governor result in section 4.2c; do not invent a dependence relation to make that example pass.

`U.Structure` follows the accepted A.22 architecture instead. A.22 identifies one context-independent selected organization from four and only four discriminators: exact independently identified constituents, exact selected obtaining relation occurrences, exact constraints as applied, and one named selection-use frame. `E24UK-AR-USTRUCTURE-R12-01` records the root admission. A bounded-context label, system, team, subsystem, model, method, work occurrence, result episteme, description, view, graph, table, representation, publication, or use does not supply that identity.

`BoundedModelUseStructure` and A.22's conditional crossing-analysis specialization are same-individual dependent predicates over already identified `U.Structure` values. The same structure individual keeps its A.22 identity; satisfying the corresponding A.22:4.1c condition adds the specialization and implies `U.Structure` membership. The bounded-model-use name has a current F.17 row. The crossing-analysis condition is strictly conditional on independently governed exact obtaining crossing occurrences plus all four A.22 base discriminators; because no positive member exists, its NameCard label remains local and pending and is not consumed here as public vocabulary. Neither condition adds a second structure individual, root identity, ambient-context discriminator, holonhood, agency, description identity, or view identity. An A.2.6 claim-scope value or membership fact affects the selection only when an exact applied constraint refers to it; that applied constraint, not the bare scope or membership outcome, occupies the third discriminator. A scope, context, label, view, publication, representation, or selected use alone creates neither the base structure nor specialization membership.

The three A.1.1 relation-kind designations consumed by the bounded-model-use test are current through `UTS.ModelApplicabilityRelation.FPFCore.2026-07-25`, `UTS.ModelUseRelation.FPFCore.2026-07-25`, and `UTS.ModelExpressionCoherenceRelation.FPFCore.2026-07-25`. Those F.17 rows publish only the names. A.1.1 contains the ClaimGraphs that give each predicate, participant set, obtaining condition, and occurrence-identity rule; a row, NameCard, matching token, or appearance in this registry makes no occurrence obtain and grants no `BoundedModelUseStructure` membership.


A project that also needs bounded quantification may declare a C.3.2 local kind whose criterion cites the already governed durable predicate. That projection neither admits the durable kind nor creates an automatic `U.SubkindOf` edge.


#### E.24.UK:4.2b - Accepted Admission-Result Registry

Each `E24UK-AR-*` reference identifies one accepted C.2.1 decision episteme; the row is only its compact projection. The result's EntityOfConcern is the subject-pattern source construct, its ClaimGraph carries the disposition, criterion, reliance, and boundary, and its effective scheme is `FPFCoreReferenceScheme`. For a non-bootstrap row, `<AdmissionResultRef>#settlement` identifies the distinct accepted `OnticSettlementResult` in that decision. The bootstrap instead uses companion result `E24-OS-UONTIC-BOOT-01`.

`RG` means reconstructed and grandfathered. The exact result reference, not the row wording, is the reliance point. Every row reopens if its direct membership or identity predicate, intended extent or named reliance, nearest non-use boundary, or shared E.24 settlement law changes; carrier, layout, and spelling changes alone do not reopen it.

`E24-CO-UONTIC-BOOT-01` takes the E.24 source construct, shared settlement rule, receiving use, and non-use boundary without presupposing `U.Ontic`. It returns `E24-OS-UONTIC-BOOT-01` and `E24UK-AR-UONTIC-BOOT-01`; neither the schema, pattern, decision, nor kind thereby becomes an ontology-unit individual.

| Result | U-kind and disposition | Subject pattern and decisive test | Named reliance; nearest non-member |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `E24UK-AR-UENTITY-RG-01` | `U.Entity`; `root`, RG | `A.1:4.1`; individuable and referenceable | all subject-pattern references; a label or row is not thereby an entity |
| `E24UK-AR-UHOLON-RG-01` | `U.Holon`; `root`, RG | `A.1:4.2`; six-part constructive holon criterion | recognition of the four root holon kinds; a collection or part list is not a holon by form |
| `E24UK-AR-UONTIC-BOOT-01` | `U.Ontic`; `root`, bootstrap | `E.24:4` plus `E24-OS-UONTIC-BOOT-01`; connected action-facing ontology unit | E.24-family and dependent ontology reuse; a topic cluster, form, or registry row is not the unit |
| `E24UK-AR-USYSTEM-RG-01` | `U.System`; `root`, RG | `A.1:4.4`; constructively recognized acting holon | A.2 and A.15; a local system-role kind, system-role-assignment occurrence, relation-participant position, declaration or representation position, Method, capability record, work record, or ordinary organizational title is not a System by that fact alone |
| `E24UK-AR-UEPISTEME-RG-01` | `U.Episteme`; `root`, RG | `C.2.1:4.1`; ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, and scheme constitute one episteme | A.3.2, A.15.2, E.17.0, and this registry; carrier, publication, or view use adds no second identity |
| `E24UK-AR-UMETHOD-RG-01` | `U.Method`; `root`, RG | `A.3.1:4`; one semantic way of doing | method-description and enactment uses; a description, plan, or dated work occurrence is not the method |
| `E24UK-AR-UWORK-RG-01` | `U.Work`; `root`, RG | `A.15.1:4`; one dated performed occurrence | A.15 and P2W; a plan, log, result, delivery, or effect is not the Work occurrence |
| `E24UK-AR-UTRANSFORMATION-RG-01` | `U.Transformation`; `root`, RG | `A.3.4:4`; one grounded actual bounded change | transformation and production uses; a planned, modeled, asserted, or represented change is not actual change |
| `E24UK-AR-URELATION-R11-01` | `U.Relation`; `root`, reconstructed | `A.6.REL:4` plus the direct relation pattern; obtaining occurrence with identity rule | occurrence-bearing epistemes and relations; predicate, assertion, designator, tuple, or edge is not the occurrence |
| `E24UK-AR-USTRUCTURE-R12-01` | `U.Structure`; `root`, R1.2 | `A.22:4.1`; one selected organization identified only by exact constituents, selected obtaining relation occurrences, applied constraints, and one named selection-use frame | selected-structure and specialization uses; context, label, system, team, subsystem, method, work, result, description, view, representation, publication, or use alone is not the structure |
| `E24UK-AR-BMUS-R12-01` | `BoundedModelUseStructure`; `same-individual-dependent` under `U.Structure`, R1.2 | `A.22:4.1c` with `A.1.1` and `A.2.6`; the same already identified structure is selected over one exact model episteme, exact admitted model-use holons, and the required obtaining A.1.1 relation occurrences under applied constraints for the named bounded-model-use frame | bounded model-use reasoning; a bounded-context or model-use label, model episteme, team, subsystem, scope, description, view, graph, table, or publication alone grants no membership |
| `E24UK-AR-A22-CROSSING-RULE-R12-01` | A.22 conditional crossing-analysis specialization; `same-individual-dependent` rule under `U.Structure`, R1.2; public term pending | `A.22:4.1c`; the same already identified structure must have several bounded model-use structures as exact constituents and exact selected obtaining crossing occurrences among them under applied constraints for one named crossing-analysis use | the rule may support future crossing analysis; no current member, context-map label, mapping method or work, view, diagram, publication, shared participant, or selected use grants membership or a public specialization name |

| `E24UK-AR-UWORKPLAN-RG-01` | `U.WorkPlan`; `same-individual-dependent` under `U.Episteme`, RG | `A.15.2:4`; intended-work membership plus root inclusion | planning and readiness; a calendar image, possible work, method description, or performed Work is not a WorkPlan |
| `E24UK-AR-USYSTEMROLEASSIGNMENT-RPR-01` | `U.SystemRoleAssignment`; `same-individual-dependent` under `U.Relation`, RPR | `A.2.1:4`; the same identified relation occurrence has family membership through one declared assignment species. That species declares `HolderSystemSlot`, a declaration-local assigned-kind slot limited to one local system-role kind, its own predicate and applicability, maximal uninterrupted occurrence identity, and every commission, position, installation, or other participant on which its identity depends. Membership implies `U.Relation` for that same occurrence. | attribution and work-facing assignment use; the family has no permissive binary root signature, and a stronger species is not a generic holder-kind occurrence plus another occurrence. A holder-kind pair, interval, assertion, responsibility claim, or generic `U.Kind` domain is not an assignment occurrence. |
| `E24UK-AR-UMETHODDESCRIPTION-RG-01` | `U.MethodDescription`; `same-individual-dependent` under `U.Episteme`, RG | `A.3.2:4`; substantive claims about one admitted method | method use and planning; mention, metadata, approval, publication, or representation is not membership |
| `E24UK-AR-UVIEWPOINT-RG-01` | `U.Viewpoint`; `same-individual-dependent` under `U.Episteme`, RG | `E.17.0:4`; fixed viewpoint-convention membership claims | E.17.0; an identifier, reference, describing use, selected viewpoint, carrier, or structure does not grant membership |
| `E24UK-AR-UVIEW-RG-01` | `U.View`; `same-individual-dependent` under `U.Episteme`, RG | `E.17.0:4`; `EpistemeViewpointConformanceRelation(E,P)` obtains | E.17.0 and A.6.3; authoring, rendering, query execution, or publication does not grant membership |

#### E.24.UK:4.2c - Open Prerequisites, Blocked Candidates, and Non-admission Results

The admission form also consumes public kind names that do not yet have a resolvable accepted admission result. They remain explicit prerequisites rather than being smuggled into the accepted registry. Existing by-value use of an exact current value may continue under its subject pattern, but no new admission may cite the unsettled kind itself as already accepted.

| Exact result or blocker reference | Current disposition | Exact missing or closing basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `E24UK-OPEN-UKIND-01` | `U.Kind` prerequisite unsettled | C.3/C.3.1 govern local kind use, but the pending C.3 repair must first settle kind identity versus signature, reference scheme, and local-use boundaries; the admission card may use an exact already identified C.3 kind as EntityOfConcern, but this row does not assert a separate accepted durable result |
| `E24UK-OPEN-UREFERENCESCHEME-01` | `U.ReferenceScheme` prerequisite unsettled | F.18 identifies the current `FPFCoreReferenceScheme` value and C.2.1 consumes an effective scheme, but no current subject pattern and accepted result state the kind's identity, extent, and non-use boundary |
| `E24UK-OPEN-UCLAIMGRAPH-01` | `U.ClaimGraph` prerequisite unsettled | C.2.1 consumes exact claim content and distinguishes it from graph representations, but no current accepted admission result and direct kind-admission pattern are resolvable from this host set |
| `E24UK-BLK-U-CAPABILITY-01` | `U.Capability` identity-dependent candidate blocked | A.2.2 supplies the holder-indexed identity tuple but not the exact governed capability-to-holder identity-dependence relation, its obtaining condition, and its identity effect |
| `E24UK-NAR-AIPR-01` | `U.ActionInvitationPrecisionRestoration`; `reject` | A.6.A governs a pattern move and the exact `actionInvitation(...)` relation; the title does not admit another kind |
| `E24UK-NAR-EPUB-01` | `U.EpistemePublication`; `reject` | an episteme keeps C.2.1 identity while an exact `EpistemePublicationRelation` may obtain; Plain `published episteme` names that participation and not another kind |

Generic `reuse` and `local-kind` are decision exits, not accepted example results. Close `reuse` only with an exact `ReusedUKindRef` that resolves to this registry; close `local-kind` only with one exact current C.3.2 `LocalKindDeclarationRef`. If either reference is absent, keep the candidate unsettled.

Consumer repair follows the disposition, not one replacement word. Method-description claims retain `U.MethodDescription`; exact viewpoint and view claims retain `U.Viewpoint` and `U.View` only under E.17.0 membership. Every lexical or source use of the rejected spelling `U.EpistemePublication` is recovered by its claim as the selected `U.Episteme`, exact `EpistemePublicationRelation` occurrence, publication form, or `U.PresentationCarrier`; the rejected kind has no occurrences to retype.

Thus `dependent` describes an admission and identity architecture. It is not a shorthand for every object named in a record, every participant of a relation, or every qualifier used to interpret an episteme.

#### E.24.UK:4.2.1 - Accepted Root Settlement For `U.Relation`

FPF has already admitted `U.Relation`; project users do not repeat this ontology decision. The root kind classifies individuable obtaining relation occurrences. A direct relation can obtain before a system explicitly individuates, names, describes, or references one occurrence, but admission under this root requires the direct relation pattern to supply an occurrence-identity rule.

| Admission condition | `U.Relation` settlement by value |
|---|---|
| governed individuals | the extent contains exactly those obtaining relation occurrences for which a direct relation pattern supplies an occurrence-identity rule |
| stable identity or membership | each exact direct-relation `ClaimGraph` states how one occurrence is reidentified and distinguished from another; participant identity, maximal continuous obtaining, constituting work, or another domain discriminator is used only when a current assertion selects it under that rule content |
| reviewable witness | `A.6.REL` supplies the common occurrence discipline; the direct relation pattern supplies relation-participant meanings, the obtaining condition, and the relation-specific identity rule |
| action-facing need | comparisons, qualifications, change claims, nested relations, and receiving direct relations can depend on one occurrence being distinguishable from another |
| non-duplication | relation-kind-specific assertions do not provide one common kind for a relation occurrence used as the EntityOfConcern of an episteme or as a participant of another direct relation |
| direct governing locus | `A.6.REL` governs the root occurrence distinction and progressive individuation; each direct relation pattern defines or constrains whether its relation obtains and how its occurrences are identified |
| shared E.24-family settlement | `E24UK-AR-URELATION-R11-01#settlement` uses the `E.24:4.0a` schema: primary governed subject kind `U.Relation`; A.6.REL common occurrence discipline plus each needed direct relation pattern's obtaining and occurrence-identity rule as the minimal governed relation set; named receiving reliance; and the non-use boundary below. `IdentityBearingDirectRelationIfSelected = none`: no relation whose participants include the `U.Relation` kind, a relation kind, or another relation occurrence is invented merely to admit the root |
| by-value dependence | A.1 part-relation admission, relation-occurrence descriptions, and direct relations whose participant kind admits `U.Relation` rely on this root by value |

The admission does not force explicit materialization of every obtaining relation. Ordinary engineering prose can stop at the direct relation sentence. A system performs explicit-individuation work only when a named receiving episteme, direct relation, or operation-application assertion depends on occurrence identity. The accepted Tech label `U.Relation` is governed separately through its F.18 NameCard; the label does not establish the extent.

Apply the positive extent rule before classifying a nearby object. Predicate content is a rule; an assertion or occurrence description is a C.2.1 episteme; a designator or reference stays under F.18; a reusable form stays under E.24.PUB; and a row, graph edge, or diagram element stays under C.29. None is the obtaining occurrence. Connect it to the occurrence only through its explicit assertion, description, designation, reference, publication, or representation relation.

The rule is not lexical. An individuable publication-relation occurrence is itself a `U.Relation` when the `EpistemePublicationRelation` ClaimGraph supplies its obtaining and identity conditions. A row that represents that occurrence remains a representation element. Reidentify the current object by the rule that defines or tests it instead of inferring membership from words such as relation, edge, link, record, or reference.

#### E.24.UK:4.3 - Practitioner-first Admission Tree

1. **Recover the candidates and criterion.** Identify the decision subject, candidate individuals, stable membership or identity rule, intended extent, nearest non-member, and named action-facing use. For a relation kind, use the rule that defines its participant meanings, obtaining, applicability, and occurrence identity, and cite the PatternID that locates that rule; an `A.6.RCD` application may record a derived or primitive candidate only with a proposed direct subject settlement. If no subject or criterion is recoverable, keep the inquiry open.
2. **Try an admitted durable kind.** If one accepted result already preserves those individuals, the criterion, extent, boundary, and use, record `reuse` through that exact result and stop.
3. **Try bounded classification.** If one project or context needs only typed membership or quantification, record `local-kind` through one exact C.3.2 declaration and stop.
4. **Test the need for a new durable kind.** Continue only when repeated cross-pattern use needs one stable membership law that existing durable kinds and direct relations cannot preserve. Run the eight tests and name each downstream question, its defining or testing rule, and the PatternID that locates that rule.
5. **Choose the positive form.** Use `root` for independently identified individuals, `same-individual-dependent` when one root individual gains an additional stable membership predicate and inclusion law, or `identity-dependent` when a distinct individual has an already governed dependence relation to one root individual plus all discriminators. Fill the shared E.24-family settlement; use one atomic co-decision if ontic and kind are both new. Apply A.11 and A.8 when kernel status is claimed.
6. **Close or reject, then name.** A missing branch law or positive-test condition blocks admission. Otherwise record `reject` and recover the non-kind object under the rule that defines or tests it. Only after one disposition and governed object are stable may F.8, F.5, F.18, or F.17 expose a public name.

The subject pattern remains a locator, not an authority: C.3 contains definitions for local kinds; A.6.REL and each direct-relation ClaimGraph define occurrence semantics; A.6.0/A.6.5 define reusable declarations; E.24 defines ontic-settlement predicates; and F.8/F.5/F.18/F.17 define or constrain names after ontology is settled.

#### E.24.UK:4.4 - Source Ontology Conversion Guide

Use this short conversion guide when a source ontology, schema, standard, class hierarchy, or top-level ontology uses words such as type, class, category, object type, entity type, kind, or subtype. BFO-style, ISO-style, OWL/RDF, database-schema, programming-language, and discipline-local type systems are source ontologies or representation regimes; they do not become FPF `U.*` names by translation.

First recover the source construct by value:

- source name and source ontology or schema;
- source identity rule, membership rule, extent rule, or recognition rule;
- source relations such as is-a, part-of, realizes, participates-in, depends-on, or equivalent local relations;
- intended source use: classification, query, modeling, exchange, validation, reasoning, implementation, or documentation.

Then select the FPF object:

| Source construct use | FPF recovery |
| --- | --- |
| claim quantification, membership, extent, subkind, kind bridge, or bounded local classification | C.3 `U.Kind`, C.3.1 `U.SubkindOf`, and typed-reasoning rules; record `local-kind` only through one exact current C.3.2 declaration referenced by `LocalKindDeclarationRef` |
| public durable FPF kind needed across patterns | use E.24.UK with the shared `E.24:4.0a` settlement; reuse an accepted ontic settlement when present, and use one atomic co-decision with separate settlement and admission outputs when both ontic and kind are new |
| a reusable coordination of one primary governed subject kind, its identity rule, minimal independently governed relation set, optional identity-bearing direct relation selected by the exact subject predicate and occurrence-identity rule, declarations actually reused, and dependent-use reliance | use the `E.24:4.0a` ontic settlement; do not invent a universal core relation or a relation whose participants are kinds, patterns, declarations, or the ontic |
| imported formal symbol or declared range in a signature or mechanism | A.6 `U.Signature` identified by `<content, EntityOfConcernRef, effectiveReferenceScheme>` with direct `SubjectKind` and `RangedValueKind` declarations, a symbol bound by that signature, a Concept-Set row, or an admitted durable U-kind |
| source-name alignment between exact F.17 cells | F.9 Bridge, F.17 term row, F.18 naming, and explicit loss notes |
| quoted source construct with no current FPF classificatory, ontic, naming-alignment, or implementation use | retain source wording with its exact local sense and quote-only or reduced-use boundary under E.10 and E.10.ARCH |
| implementation or serialization category | representation, publication form, record field, schema field, or direct implementation artifact handled under the rule that defines or tests its use |

A source "type" may become an FPF kind and may require an ontic, but only after these tests. If the source construct only supplies local classification or exchange syntax, keep it as C.3 typed reasoning, bridge material, representation material, or source wording. Do not create a rival FPF type layer beside durable U-kind governance and E.24 ontic settlement.

#### E.24.UK:4.5 - Structural Location Rule

A `U.*` spelling in a pattern title, host filename, monolith heading, or ToC row is stronger than a prose occurrence. Structural locations orient readers to the governed object.

Use this rule:

- **Prose occurrence:** recover the local claim, the rule that defines or tests it, and that rule's PatternID locator.
- **Table row or record field:** recover whether it is one SlotSpec, one assertion or description field, one reusable-form element, or an already governed object.
- **Heading:** retain `U.*` only when the section's primary EntityOfConcern is that object or the heading directly references an already admitted U-kind.
- **Pattern title or host filename:** retain `U.*` only when the pattern's primary EntityOfConcern is that root or dependent U-kind.
- **ToC row:** retain `U.*` only when the row points to the passage that carries the accepted settlement; otherwise name the direct governed object or repair the wording with E.10.

Do not keep a false `U.*` structural name for memory or search convenience. Use a Plain label, local heading, Name Card, Concept-Set row, relation name, record field, or quoted source wording when that is the actual object.

#### E.24.UK:4.6 - Failed U-kind Admission Dispatch

When positive admission fails, take the first truthful exit: `reuse` with one accepted result, `local-kind` with one C.3.2 declaration, or `reject` with the actual object handled under its defining or testing rule. A participating entity keeps its intrinsic kind; a declaration component stays an A.6.5 SlotSpec; a designation or claim field stays in its episteme; a structure, publication form, or representation stays under A.22, E.24.PUB, or C.29; and a measure or source expression stays with its measurement or wording-use rule. Public naming waits until that recovery is complete.

### E.24.UK:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### E.24.UK:5.0 - Five Replays Through One Decision Sequence

Use the same five steps in every replay: (1) identify the decision's EntityOfConcern and named use; (2) test an existing durable kind, direct relation, and bounded C.3 classification; (3) state governed individuals, membership or identity, intended extent, and the nearest non-member; (4) run all eight conditions, the shared E.24-family settlement, and the A.11/A.8 branch when current; (5) record one result reference, naming result, non-use boundary, and reopen condition. A future genuinely new candidate must complete this sequence before its public name is admitted.

In each closed replay, the `E24UK-*` result reference identifies the exact C.2.1 decision episteme, the five steps summarize its ClaimGraph, and its effective reference scheme is `FPFCoreReferenceScheme`. A stopped replay names the exact blocker instead of pretending that an admission result exists.

**Reconstructed root — `U.Relation`.**

1. **Subject and use.** The EntityOfConcern is the A.6.REL source construct for the common kind of individuable obtaining relation occurrences. C.2.1 and receiving direct relations need to refer to one exact occurrence without turning an assertion, row, or graph edge into that occurrence.
2. **Coverage.** No other admitted durable kind covers all and only those occurrences. A bounded C.3 kind would not supply the cross-pattern root used by direct relation patterns.
3. **Membership.** An individual enters the extent only when its direct relation pattern establishes obtaining and supplies an occurrence-identity rule under A.6.REL. Predicate content, an assertion, description, designator, reference, tuple, or edge is the nearest non-member.
4. **Eight tests and settlement.** Governed individuals, stable occurrence identity, direct-pattern witness, action-facing occurrence use, non-duplication, A.6.REL plus the direct relation pattern, `E24UK-AR-URELATION-R11-01#settlement`, and by-value reliance are all present. A.11 retains one common root rather than duplicating it for every direct relation; A.8 does not promote relation-specific names into additional universal roots.
5. **Result and flip.** `E24UK-AR-URELATION-R11-01` records `root`; `NC-U-RELATION` retains the Tech label `U.Relation`. Reopen when the common occurrence criterion, direct identity discipline, dependent use, or settlement law changes. If an already admitted kind is found with the same governed extent and use, the disposition changes to `reuse`.

**Same-individual dependent — `U.WorkPlan`.**

1. **Subject and use.** The EntityOfConcern is A.15.2's WorkPlan kind-source construct; `MaintenancePlan_Q3` is a member witness, not the decision subject. Planning and readiness patterns need one durable way to recognize substantive intended-work epistemes.
2. **Coverage.** `U.Episteme` already supplies individual identity, but it does not by itself distinguish epistemes that substantively coordinate intended work. A one-project classification would be tested under C.3 before durable admission.
3. **Membership.** C.2.1 identifies `MaintenancePlan_Q3`; A.15.2's plan-membership predicate classifies that same individual as `U.WorkPlan` and implies its root `U.Episteme` membership. A calendar image or ticket title without substantive intended-work claims is the nearest non-member.
4. **Eight tests and settlement.** Identified epistemes, C.2.1 identity, the A.15.2 membership witness, planning use, non-duplication, A.15.2 as direct locus, `E24UK-AR-UWORKPLAN-RG-01#settlement`, and by-value A.15 reliance are present. Under A.11's test, the result is a same-individual dependent kind rather than a second root or plan object; no new A.8 universal root is claimed.
5. **Result and flip.** `E24UK-AR-UWORKPLAN-RG-01` records `same-individual-dependent`; the existing Tech label `U.WorkPlan` is retained and this replay mints no new name. Reopen when C.2.1 identity, A.15.2 membership, the planning use, or settlement law changes. If only one bounded project needs the distinction and one exact C.3.2 declaration suffices, the disposition changes to `local-kind`.

**Same-individual structure specializations — `BoundedModelUseStructure` and the A.22 conditional crossing-analysis rule.**

1. **Subject and use.** The decision subjects are the A.22 source constructs for base `U.Structure` and its two model-use specializations. A.1.1 and crossing-analysis consumers need durable membership without turning a context, team, subsystem, description, or view into another structure individual.
2. **Coverage.** `U.Structure` supplies the one base identity. The two specialization conditions add stable action-facing membership to that same individual; neither needs an independent root or an identity-dependence relation to a context-like bearer.
3. **Membership and near-misses.** A.22 first identifies `PressControlUse_S` from exact constituents `PressControlModel-5`, `Press-3`, and `PressControllerCode-17`; selected obtaining `ModelApplicabilityRelation`, `ModelUseRelation`, and `ModelExpressionCoherenceRelation` occurrences; an exact applied safety-control constraint claim whose proposition refers to the claim scope used by that selection; and the named use “decide whether operating use and controller-code maintenance belong to one bounded model-use organization.” That claim may state a proposition about the scope or its A.2.6 membership predicate; neither the bare scope nor the membership outcome is the constraint claim. Only then may the same `PressControlUse_S` satisfy `BoundedModelUseStructure`. The supplier-to-billing material currently supplies only a proposed six-part crossing organization—source `SupplierUse_S`, target `BillingUse_S`, direction, required fit, permitted loss, and claim scope. `SupplierToBillingTranslation_R` and `SupplierBillingCrossing_S` are not asserted: no compatible exact crossing predicate and current facts make the crossing obtain, so the A.22 relation-occurrence discriminator and base identity are unavailable. Only after that predicate is defined, current facts satisfy it, and all four A.22 discriminators are established may the same identified structure satisfy the conditional crossing-analysis specialization. `PressControlTeam`, a `BillingContext` label, `ContextMap_v3` as a `U.View`, its diagram, and its publication occurrence identify none of those structures and grant no specialization membership.
4. **Eight tests and settlement.** Governed base-structure and bounded-model-use individuals, A.22 identity and positive bounded-model-use membership witnesses, action-facing model-use needs, non-duplication, A.22 as direct locus, the relevant settlements, and by-value reliance are present. For the conditional crossing-analysis specialization, this replay settles only the same-individual-dependent membership rule and its action-facing need; it has no positive witness and no public F.17 row while the direct crossing governor is absent. A.2.6 contributes only when an applied constraint refers to an exact claim scope. That constraint, not the bare scope, membership outcome, or its representation, occupies the third discriminator.
5. **Result and flip.** `E24UK-AR-USTRUCTURE-R12-01` records `root`; `E24UK-AR-BMUS-R12-01` records the current named `same-individual-dependent` specialization; `E24UK-AR-A22-CROSSING-RULE-R12-01` records only the conditional `same-individual-dependent` crossing-analysis rule without asserting a current member or public term. Each specialization implies `U.Structure` membership only for the same individual that satisfies its exact A.22 condition. If the four base discriminators cannot be recovered, stop at the exact description or representation. If base identity is established but one specialization condition fails, retain only the base `U.Structure`; do not repair the failure with a context label, another structure identity, holonhood, or view typing. Reopen only when the A.22 identity or specialization condition, the A.2.6 applied-scope interface, the named reliance, or the shared settlement law changes.

**Identity-dependent candidate — blocked by a missing identity-dependence relation.**


1. **Subject and use.** The EntityOfConcern is A.2.2's capability kind-source construct; `Pump37MaintenanceCapability_2026` would be one capability individual distinct from holder system `Pump37`. The intended use is reidentifying the capability through its holder while evidence, assignment, and work change.
2. **Coverage.** `U.System` cannot classify the distinct capability individual, and a local kind would not replace a missing identity rule.
3. **Membership and missing relation.** A.2.2 contains a holder-indexed tuple, but no rule for a two-place capability-to-holder identity-dependence relation, obtaining condition, or identity effect. A holder field or reference is not that relation.
4. **Failed tests.** Stable identity, reviewable witness, and shared-settlement condition 7 fail at the same missing governor. The A.11 and A.8 tests are not run, and naming does not begin.
5. **Result and flip.** `E24UK-BLK-U-CAPABILITY-01` is the resolvable result; there is no accepted identity-dependent admission to reconstruct. Reopen only when A.2.2 defines the exact dependence relation and its identity effect. If recovery shows only a capability assertion, evidence item, fit assessment, or record field rather than a distinct governed individual, the disposition changes to `reject`.

**Rejected near-miss — `U.EpistemePublication`.**

1. **Subject and use.** The EntityOfConcern is the proposed kind source construct for an episteme made available to an audience; the use is to speak plainly about that availability.
2. **Coverage.** `U.Episteme` already identifies the episteme, while E.24.PUB defines the exact publication occurrence, selected edition, audience, use, and publication-form boundary.
3. **Failed membership.** Publication participation can begin and end without reidentifying the episteme and supplies neither a stable dependent-membership predicate nor a distinct individual. An unpublished edition of the same episteme is the discriminating near-miss.
4. **Failed tests and settlement.** Stable membership and non-duplication fail; `E24-OS-EPISTEME-ONTIC-01` and the E.24.PUB rules already identify the needed objects and publication relation. Applying the A.11 duplicate-kind test records rejection; do not apply A.8 or begin naming.
5. **Result.** `E24UK-NAR-EPUB-01` records `reject`. Use Plain **published episteme** only in a claim that identifies or permits recovery of the obtaining `EpistemePublicationRelation`; admit no `U.EpistemePublication` name. Reopen only if a later cited rule defines a stable classificatory distinction not reducible to publication participation.

#### E.24.UK:5.3 - Broad rule-content provision/support candidate

A proposal groups phrases such as "this pattern defines or constrains the result", "the framework supports the claim", and "service provision" under one public kind. The phrases do not identify common individuals: one locates defining claim content, another may describe evidence or source use, and the third may designate dated Work, a Method, promise content, or an operational bearer. They share neither an identity or membership rule nor a receiver that needs the proposed instances as one kind.

Recover each material occurrence first under C.2.1 and its exact subject relation. Then return `reject` for the broad candidate. Each result cites the corresponding assertion through `RejectedCandidateRecoveryRef`; it does not cite the shared word list or migration table. Genuine Work, source, evidence, publication, authority, access, and direct-relation claims survive unchanged in their own meanings. An unrecovered occurrence stays unchanged. The rejection admits no `U.Provision`, `U.Support`, generic `SupportRelation`, governance occurrence, or rule-locus description kind.

#### E.24.UK:5.4 - Type And Kind Governance Passage

A passage that says a proposed type must pass A.8 or A.11 is a kernel-level U-kind admission question. A passage that says `U.Kind` and `U.SubkindOf` are used for typed reasoning remains under C.3 rules. A naming passage in F.5 or F.8 waits until the governed object and admission decision are stable.

#### E.24.UK:5.5 - Lower-level Heading

A lower-level heading containing `U.*` does not admit kindhood by heading shape. Recover whether the heading names an already admitted root or dependent U-kind, a declaration-local SlotKind, a claim-bearing `U.Episteme`, a relation-defined participant meaning, or a publication object. Keep the recovered object and the rule that defines or tests it; rename the heading when it advertises a different kind.

### E.24.UK:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern blocks punctuation-bias and taxonomy-bias. A `U.*` spelling, title, filename, table row, or imported type word is not enough to create a durable FPF kind. Recover the governed individuals, their identity or membership rule, and the PatternID that locates that rule first. When the candidate instead names participation in a relation, a SlotSpec, an assertion or description field, a selected `U.Structure`, an `E.24.PUB` form, or a `C.29` representation element, retain that exact object and its defining or testing rule. For a structure specialization, first recover the same base individual through A.22's four discriminators; a context, system, team, subsystem, label, scope, method, work, result, view, representation, publication, or use creates neither that base identity nor dependent membership. Only then decide whether any durable U-kind distinction remains.

### E.24.UK:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Closure condition |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-E24UK-1` | Before the decision card is filled, one exact local kind, proposal episteme, or source-construct entity is selected as its EntityOfConcern; if none is identifiable, the work remains inquiry and stops before an admission disposition. |
| `CC-E24UK-1a` | The proposed criterion, governed individuals, intended extent and non-member boundary, public spelling, and dependent claims remain in the decision ClaimGraph. An extension, member list, rule bundle, title, or spelling never substitutes for the EntityOfConcern. |
| `CC-E24UK-2` | Durable membership follows the admitted kind's direct predicate and reference scheme; its extent contains exactly the independently identified candidates for which that predicate holds. |
| `CC-E24UK-2a` | A C.3 local projection cites the durable predicate in its own `KindSignature` criterion and creates neither durable admission nor an automatic `U.SubkindOf` edge. |
| `CC-E24UK-3` | Every positive root or dependent result cites one exact accepted `OnticSettlementResult` under the shared `E.24:4.0a` schema, plus the kind's direct membership, extent, and branch-specific law; no owner label or universal head relation substitutes for that settlement. |
| `CC-E24UK-3a` | Root `U.Relation` classifies only individuable obtaining relation occurrences. `A.6.REL` supplies the common discipline; each admitted direct or derived relation kind has a direct subject settlement for participant meanings, obtaining, applicability, and occurrence identity. An `A.6.RCD` local-claim or predicate-definition result does not count as kind admission; only a derived or primitive candidate that carries the proposed direct subject settlement can be tested by the E.24/E.24.UK admission rules. |
| `CC-E24UK-3b` | The claim-bearing decision episteme records exactly one typed `AdmissionDisposition` value — `root`, `same-individual-dependent`, `identity-dependent`, `reuse`, `local-kind`, or `reject` — and only the detail fields conditional on that value; it creates no project-side relation occurrence, and naming begins only after disposition. |
| `CC-E24UK-3c` | The practitioner-first admission tree tests exact existing-kind coverage and bounded C.3 classification before new admission; a failed new admission closes only as `local-kind` with one exact C.3.2 declaration or as `reject` with the actual object and direct governor recovered under section 4.6. |
| `CC-E24UK-3d` | When both a new ontic and a new public U-kind are needed, one atomic `E24FamilySettlementDecision` returns separate settlement and admission result refs from common inputs. Neither output is prior evidence for the other, and neither is accepted while the other branch remains unresolved. |
| `CC-E24UK-4` | A same-individual dependent kind states its root kind, direct membership predicate, and the implication from dependent to root membership for the same individual. An identity-dependent kind states an already governed two-place dependence relation to one exact root-kind individual plus every additional discriminator; a root reference alone never closes either case. |
| `CC-E24UK-4a` | `U.MethodDescription` preserves C.2.1 identity and uses the exact stable A.3.2 membership condition: one admitted `U.Method` is the exact EntityOfConcern and at least one substantive claim concerns that method as a way of doing; mention-only content, use adequacy, C.29 representation, publication occurrence, publication form, `U.PresentationCarrier`, approval, and work do not establish membership. `U.Viewpoint` and `U.View` likewise preserve C.2.1 identity and use the exact stable E.17.0 membership predicates; structure selection, bundle membership, a describing use or its selected viewpoint, direct authoring, A.6.3 construction, form, carrier, publication, query execution, evaluation, and work do not substitute for those predicates. |
| `CC-E24UK-4b` | `U.EpistemePublication` is rejected; Plain `published episteme` is relation-defined wording in a claim that states obtaining participation and identifies or permits recovery of the exact `EpistemePublicationRelation` occurrence. The Plain wording is neither a reference nor a designator and does not resolve. |
| `CC-E24UK-4c` | Every retained public example resolves through one exact `E24UK-AR-*` admission-result reference whose row names the disposition, defining-rule locator, named reliance, non-use boundary, and reopen condition. The row is a projection of the decision episteme, not the decision, kind, or evidence. |
| `CC-E24UK-4d` | Under the effective reference scheme, `ViewpointId i` designates exact viewpoint episteme P and resolving `U.ViewpointRef r` that uses i yields P; i, r, and P remain distinct, and neither designation nor resolution grants membership. Membership follows only from E.17.0's predicate. A named describing use may select P, but the use and selection remain separate from designation, reference resolution, conformance, and membership. |
| `CC-E24UK-4e` | Bootstrap co-decision `E24-CO-UONTIC-BOOT-01` returns distinct outputs `E24-OS-UONTIC-BOOT-01` and `E24UK-AR-UONTIC-BOOT-01` without presupposing an admitted `U.Ontic` or making the schema, pattern, decision episteme, or kind an ontology-unit instance. Any prerequisite kind without a resolvable accepted result remains in the open table. |
| `CC-E24UK-4f` | Base `U.Structure` identity is context-independent and comes only from the four A.22 discriminators. `BoundedModelUseStructure` and A.22's conditional crossing-analysis specialization are same-individual dependent predicates over an already identified structure and add no second root identity. Only the bounded-model-use name currently has an F.17 public row. An A.2.6 scope or membership outcome affects identity only through an exact applied constraint that refers to it; the bare value or outcome is not a discriminator. A context, system, team, subsystem, label, scope, method, work, result, description, view, representation, publication, or use alone creates neither the base structure nor specialization membership. |

| `CC-E24UK-5` | Structural locations retain `U.*` only with settlement evidence or direct reference to an already admitted U-kind. |
| `CC-E24UK-6` | A world-side relation participant retains its independently governed kind, while the relation's ClaimGraph states its participant meaning. |
| `CC-E24UK-6a` | A reusable declaration component remains one A.6.5 SlotSpec; its SlotKind does not become a U-kind. |
| `CC-E24UK-6b` | A participant designation or other assertion or description field remains inside the receiving `U.Episteme`. |
| `CC-E24UK-6c` | A selected structure, reusable form, or representation element remains under `A.22`, `E.24.PUB`, or `C.29` respectively. |
| `CC-E24UK-7` | F.8, F.5, F.18, and F.17 are used only after the governed object and admission decision are stable. |
| `CC-E24UK-8` | E.24 remains the head ontic pattern; use E.24.UK for detailed U-kind admission without duplicating that procedure back into E.24. |

### E.24.UK:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Failure | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **U-dot by punctuation.** A heading or filename contains `U.` and therefore survives as a kind. | Public spelling outruns admission. | Apply the durable U-kind test; otherwise rename to the governed object. |
| **Participation or SlotKind becomes kind.** An entity receives a new U-kind because it participates in a relation, or a `RelationSignature` SlotKind is read as a world-side kind. | Participation meaning and reusable declaration are collapsed. | Keep the entity's independently governed kind, state the direct relation, and keep the SlotKind only inside its A.6.5 SlotSpec. |
| **Source type import.** A BFO, ISO, OWL, database, or programming-language type is copied as an FPF U-kind. | Source ontology and FPF ontic admission rules become mixed. | Use the source conversion guide and name the FPF governed object. |
| **Searchable title wins.** A memorable heading remains public even though the body governs a record, publication form, relation structure, or local frame. | Discoverability replaces ontology. | Keep the searchable phrase in entry or retrieval material if useful, and put the governed object in the public pattern name. |
| **Dependent kind promoted.** A dependent distinction is admitted as an independent root U-kind, or a root reference is treated as proof of dependence. | FPF grows duplicate roots, hides the root-inclusion law, or claims an unidentified dependence. | For the same individual, state the dependent membership predicate and its implication to root membership. For a distinct individual, cite an already governed exact dependence relation and its discriminators; otherwise stop admission at the missing governor. |
| **Structure specialization re-rooted.** A context, system, team, subsystem, model-use label, scope, method, work result, view, diagram, publication, or named use is treated as if it created a base structure or one of its specializations. | The A.22 four-discriminator identity is bypassed, and description, representation, use, or a pending label is mistaken for structure membership. | Identify the exact `U.Structure` under A.22 first. Add `BoundedModelUseStructure` only when its A.22:4.1c condition holds; apply the conditional crossing-analysis rule only after independently governed crossings and all four base discriminators exist. Otherwise retain the actual context-like, epistemic, representational, publication, or use object under its defining or testing rule. |

| **Contingent qualification promoted.** Temporary participation in a publication or another direct relation is given a durable U-kind. | The same individual appears to change kind merely because a relation starts or ends. | Keep the exact relation occurrence and use Plain relation-defined wording; for publication use Plain `published episteme` and E.24.PUB. |

### E.24.UK:9 - Consequences

Positive consequences:

- public `U.*` names become reliable orientation signals;
- dependent durable U-kinds can be named without pretending to be independent roots;
- model-use structure specializations can be named without duplicating A.22 base identity or collapsing contexts, systems, views, representations, publications, or uses into structures;
- type and kind wording is handled through C.3, E.24.UK, A.8, A.11, F.8, and F.5 rather than preserved as overlapping ontology;
- structural names are settled before they become misleading public names.

Costs:

- pattern authors must read the governed object before keeping a convenient `U.*` spelling;
- some familiar host filenames, headings, and ToC rows must be renamed;
- structural inventory work becomes part of U-kind governance, not an afterthought.

### E.24.UK:10 - Rationale

FPF needs U-kind names to stay rare and load-bearing because they orient many patterns at once. Without a separate U-kind governance rule, ordinary type words, source-ontology classes, slot labels, filenames, and memorable headings create a second ontology beside E.24 ontic settlement and C.3 typed reasoning.

The admission rule keeps durable classification connected to direct ontology without making every local class public. E.24 and E.24.UK share one settlement; C.3 handles bounded classification. A same-individual dependent kind adds one membership predicate and root-inclusion law to an existing individual. An identity-dependent kind instead requires a governed relation to a distinct root-kind individual plus all discriminators. Missing branch evidence blocks admission, and no public name, reference field, or owner label substitutes for it.

### E.24.UK:11 - SoTA-Echoing

Use these sources as pressure on the admission decision, not as a borrowed taxonomy. The sources disagree at important seams: for example, OntoUML treats a Role as an anti-rigid type of the same bearer, whereas BFO treats a role as a specifically dependent continuant. The FPF dispositions `root`, `same-individual-dependent`, and `identity-dependent`, the C.3 split, and the durable-public threshold are therefore explicit FPF decisions. No source below is cited as if it supplied that three-way taxonomy.

**Type, membership, and dependent form.** Almeida, Guizzardi, Sales, and Fonseca's [gUFO paper, 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.20948) selects a typology of types and explicit patterns for intrinsic and relational aspects. The current [OntoUML Vocabulary](https://dev.ontouml.org/ontouml-vocabulary/) distinguishes identity-providing kinds and subkinds from relational Roles, intrinsic-condition Phases, dependent Quality individuals, and relation-grounding Relators.

FPF mutation: adopt the separation questions, not those categories. First decide whether the same already identified individual gains membership or a distinct individual needs a governed dependence relation.

**Dependence is not parthood.** [ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 BFO](https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html) remains the published standard lineage. The current BFO 2020 Common Logic artifacts keep [specific dependency](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/blob/master/21838-2/common-logic/specific-dependency.cl) and [continuant mereology](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/blob/master/21838-2/common-logic/continuant-mereology.cl) as distinct relation families. The specific-dependency axioms also prohibit a specifically dependent continuant and its bearer from sharing a continuant part.

FPF mutation: require an exact dependence governor for an identity-dependent admission and never infer part-of from dependence.

**Class inclusion, individuals, properties, and labels.** The W3C [OWL 2 Direct Semantics](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-direct-semantics/) and [Structural Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/) are labelled lineage baselines, not current-best admission guidance. They distinguish class extensions, individuals, and object properties; `SubClassOf` makes the first extension a subset of the second; annotation labels have no logical effect; and imports make another ontology's axioms available.

FPF mutation: use the inclusion lesson for the same-individual root implication, but require one cited rule to define identity and membership. A label, import, or class axiom alone admits no durable U-kind.

**Modularity, scope, and reuse.** Shimizu and Hitzler's [2024 modular-ontology direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09601), the [MODL library](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05405), and the operationalized [OBO Foundry principles](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8546234/) support reusable bounded patterns, explicit scope, and reuse of existing relations.

FPF mutation: apply the existing-governor-first rule. Repeated cross-pattern need is necessary but not sufficient for durable admission; one stable membership or identity law, its PatternID locator, named reliance, and a non-use boundary must also be present.

**Designation versus governed object.** [ISO 704:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/79077.html) addresses the links among objects, concepts, definitions, and designations as separately named positions in terminology work.

FPF mutation: choose a public spelling through F.18 and the naming patterns only after the classified individuals, criterion, disposition, and direct governor are settled. A preferred term, filename, heading, or table row is naming pressure, not kind identity or admission.

#### Source-pressure tests for the FPF categories

1. **Same-individual membership and ontology-level inclusion.** `MaintenancePlan_Q3` remains the one episteme identified by C.2.1. A.15.2 may add `U.WorkPlan` membership and the implication to `U.Episteme`; it does not create a second plan individual. OntoUML Role/Phase and OWL subclassing are useful comparators, but only the FPF direct membership predicate and root-inclusion law close this admission.
2. **Identity dependence and non-parthood.** `Pump37MaintenanceCapability_2026` would be distinct from holder system `Pump37`. gUFO/BFO show that dependent aspects can be distinct individuals, but they do not provide the missing FPF capability-to-holder relation or its identity effect. The candidate therefore remains at `E24UK-BLK-U-CAPABILITY-01`; even a future dependence result would establish no part-of claim.
3. **Role and phase near-misses.** A technician role or a damaged-pump phase does not by itself reidentify its bearer. When the distinction is only participation in a current relation or an intrinsic condition for one bounded use, keep the same individual and use the direct relation or a C.3 local kind. Do not mint either another individual or a durable U-kind merely because an external taxonomy offers Role or Phase.
4. **Quality and relation-individual near-misses.** A source model may treat a pressure quality or an obligation-bearing relation individual as a distinct dependent individual. FPF opens a distinct-individual admission only when a defining rule identifies that individual and its exact dependence relation. A measurement value, quality assertion, participant pair, agreement document, or relation record is not that individual and cannot move the case into `identity-dependent`.
5. **C.3 separation and the durable threshold.** `HighRiskPump@Turnaround2026`, defined by one turnaround's risk rule, can support local quantification through one C.3.2 declaration without becoming a public durable U-kind. No selected source mandates this exact FPF split. Record this governance decision under E.24.UK: only repeated cross-pattern reliance that cannot be preserved by existing kinds, direct relations, and one bounded local declaration may proceed to positive durable admission.

Reopen this source basis when a cited edition changes, a stronger current source defeats one of these mutations, or a worked counterexample shows that the FPF result identifies the wrong individual, membership, dependence, inclusion, local-kind boundary, or non-parthood outcome.

### E.24.UK:12 - Relations

- **Shares settlement with:** `E.24` through the one `E24FamilySettlementDecision` schema in `E.24:4.0a`. E.24.UK records the `UKindAdmissionResult`; E.24 records the `OnticSettlementResult`. An existing result may be reused, while a case needing both new outputs is one atomic co-decision with neither output used as prior evidence.
- **Uses for relation admission:** `A.6.REL` defines the common occurrence discipline; each relation's ClaimGraph supplies participant meanings, obtaining, applicability, and occurrence identity; and an `A.6.RCD` application may record a residual claim or a derived-or-primitive candidate with its proposed direct subject settlement. Local-claim and predicate-definition results remain claim content and do not admit a relation kind.
- **Uses for neighboring objects:** `A.6.0` defines reusable signature identity; `A.6.5` defines `SlotSpec` declarations; `C.2.1` defines admission-decision, assertion, and description episteme identity; `F.18` supplies the naming rule for selected Tech labels and designators; `C.29` defines mathematical and data-model representation use.
- **Coordinates with:** `A.22` for context-independent base `U.Structure` identity, the `BoundedModelUseStructure` membership condition, and the still-local conditional crossing-analysis rule; `A.1.1` for the bounded model-use participants and exact obtaining relations; `A.2.6` for claim-scope membership used by exact applied constraints; `C.3`, `C.3.1`, and `C.3.2` for local typed reasoning and membership judgments; `E.24.CD` for candidate detection before an E.24 ontic decision; any resulting U-kind spelling or admission pressure still requires its own E.24.UK decision, and neither pattern determines the other's disposition; `E.24.PUB` for `EpistemePublicationRelation`, publication form, and carrier distinctions; `A.3.2` for `U.MethodDescription` membership; `E.17.0` for `U.Viewpoint`, `EpistemeViewpointConformanceRelation`, and `U.View` membership; `A.6.3` only for an optional viewing construction; `A.8` and `A.11` for kernel parsimony; and `E.10` for source wording that still hides the governed object.
- **Does not replace:** the rule that defines or constrains the classified individuals, their identity or membership, intended extent, and action-facing use, or the PatternID that locates that rule.
