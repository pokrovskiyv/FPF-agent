## E.11 - Practical-Use Guidance and Pattern Discovery

> **Type:** Pattern-language governance pattern (E)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative for public FPF practical-use guidance, bounded card comparison, and reliance-conditioned comparison records.

### E.11:1 - Problem frame

#### E.11:1.1 - Use this when

Use `E.11` when a practitioner, manager, or assisting agent has a recognizable working situation but does not yet know which FPF pattern to inspect first.

Public guidance answers three questions quickly: "Is this my situation? What useful result could I obtain first? Which direct pattern should I open?" A public example remains a template; it is not a project instance, applicability finding, recommendation, plan, decision, or work occurrence.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** One context-free public practical-use guidance episteme and its expansion, published through an E.17-conforming public card unit.

**Conditional support object.** A `PracticalUseCardShortlist@Context` is current only when a named receiving use relies on addressable comparison history. It records that bounded comparison; it is not a second public guidance form or the primary `EntityOfConcern`.

**What this buys.** A cold reader can move from an ordinary project question to one or a few inspectable direct patterns. A wrong first choice remains recoverable, while ordinary comparison stays conversational.

**Not this pattern when.** Use `E.11.PUA` after one direct pattern has been selected and its application to obtain the first result is current. Use `E.11.PUR` when local applicability, recommendation, coordination, or ordering among candidate pattern uses is current. Use the direct subject pattern for the actual result, plan, work, evidence, decision, or publication claim.

### E.11:2 - Problem

Pattern libraries are difficult to enter from a working situation. A reader may see a long table of contents, search by a familiar word, or choose the first appealing pattern title. That choice can be premature because nearby cards may lead to different first results and different stop conditions.

Attempts to help can create a second problem. Public guidance becomes a numbered method, a shadow pattern body, or a form that asks the reader to fabricate project-local values before the direct pattern has been inspected. The discovery aid then competes with the patterns it should expose.

### E.11:3 - Forces

| Force | Pressure on the solution |
| --- | --- |
| Recognition | Public wording starts from situations engineers recognize, not internal pattern topology. |
| Exactness | Every candidate points to a direct `Solution` and an exact first-result kind. |
| No fictitious context | Public guidance has no reader-project identity and cannot contain `@Context` instances. |
| Bounded search | Several cards can remain plausible, so comparison needs stop and return conditions rather than one perfect first guess. |
| Light ordinary use | Card comparison should normally remain in conversation. |
| Durable reliance | A named transfer, replay, audit, or automation use can rely on addressable comparison history. |
| Didactic continuity | Every card needs a readable walkthrough, not only a list of PatternIDs. |
| One source of guidance | README carries the public card set; Preface, ToC, retrieval, and pattern bodies answer different questions. |

### E.11:4 - Solution

Publish fifteen semantic practical-use cards. Each card starts from a recognizable situation and question, states a readable first result, points to direct candidate-use templates, and links to an expansion with boundaries and one walkthrough.

The keys identify situations; they do not order them. A user may compare any finite set that remains plausible.

#### E.11:4.1 - Public card and expansion

```

Exactly one walkthrough ref is present. Use `demonstrativeSliceRef` when the example passes A.22.CGUS admission in its own declared illustrative bounded context. It does not fill a reader-project position. Otherwise use an ordinary walkthrough with an explicit reason why the example is not a CGUS slice.

#### E.11:4.1.1 - Cold-reader recognition and grounded public value

Test every public card and expansion against a first-time engineer, engineer-manager, or assisting agent who has not studied FPF. The heading and first sentence name a recognizable working situation before PatternIDs, FPF kind names, or internal quality, projection, and conformance vocabulary. They then name a first useful result that the reader can imagine producing or requesting in the project. The expansion and direct pattern restore the exact result kind, relation, boundary, and stronger-use conditions; plain recognition is not licence to leave those values vague.

A public benefit claim is grounded only when the card makes recoverable a concrete project need, a first useful result, one specific direct-pattern distinction that changes the next project action, and the direct pattern whose `Solution` governs obtaining that result. Otherwise the claim is marketing copy, even if it sounds plausible. These values may remain readable prose; this rule does not require the reader to fill a card or project record before opening the direct pattern.

Keep the public set representative of FPF's practical range. Wording and description repair remain visible, but they do not dominate architecture, problem shaping, work, comparison, evidence, timing, causal use, mathematical modeling, quality, improvement, and framework authoring.

#### E.11:4.2 - Public helper epistemes

```text

PublicResultCoarseningRow@FPFReadme:
  readableResultPhraseRef: U.Episteme
  exactResultKindRef: U.Kind
  exactResultRelationSignatureRef?: RelationSignature
  governingPatternRef: U.MethodDescription
```

A result relation signature is present exactly when its result kind admits a relation. `return`, `wrongTurnRecovery`, and `strongerNeighbor` boundaries name a receiving pattern and position description. `recognizableCondition` and `stop` leave those positions absent.

The optional obstacle names a recognizable obstacle only when one matters. Practical use may begin from an object to inspect, a result to evaluate, or an existing method to improve without first inventing a problem.

#### E.11:4.3 - Candidate-use templates and basis completeness

```text
PublicCandidatePatternUseTemplate@FPFReadme <: U.Episteme:
  templateKey: PublicCandidateUseTemplateKeyValue
  recognizableConditionRef: PublicPatternUseBoundaryConditionTemplate@FPFReadme
  directPatternRef: U.MethodDescription
  directSolutionSectionRef: PatternSolutionSectionRef
  expectedResultTemplateRef: PublicPatternUseResultTemplate@FPFReadme
  candidateBasisCompletenessConditionRefs[1..*]: CandidatePatternUseBasisCompletenessCondition@FPFReadme

CandidatePatternUseBasisCompletenessCondition@FPFReadme <: U.Episteme:
  candidateBasisPosition: boundedContext | entityOfConcern | entityOfConcernKind | practicalQuestion | optionalProblemCard | candidateSpecificBasis
  admittedBasisValueKindRef: U.Kind
  completenessConditionDescriptionRef: U.Episteme
```

`PatternSolutionSectionRef` is an edition-pinned reference to the cited pattern's `Solution`. A broad result family or pattern title is insufficient.

The completeness condition inherits C.2.1 constitution. Its EntityOfConcern is the reusable candidate-basis position declared by the template; its ClaimGraph states the admitted filler kind and positive completeness condition; its ReferenceScheme explains how current project fillers satisfy that position. It contains no project value and orders nobody to fill a form.

#### E.11:4.4 - Ordinary walkthrough

```text
PublicOrdinaryWalkthrough@FPFReadme <: U.Episteme:
  guidanceRef: PracticalUseGuidance@FPFReadme
  situationDescriptionRef: U.Episteme
  firstResultTemplateRef: PublicPatternUseResultTemplate@FPFReadme
  walkthroughRowRefs[2..*]: PublicOrdinaryWalkthroughRow@FPFReadme

PublicOrdinaryWalkthroughRow@FPFReadme <: U.Episteme:

  expectedResultTemplateRef: PublicPatternUseResultTemplate@FPFReadme
  directPatternRef: U.MethodDescription
  directSolutionSectionRef: PatternSolutionSectionRef
  continuationConditionRef: PublicPatternUseBoundaryConditionTemplate@FPFReadme
```

An ordinary walkthrough is still an explanation, not a project method, work order, or recommendation. It may contain a local pattern mantra: a short repeatable formulation that keeps that pattern's Solution in attention. It may be presented as a CGUS-demonstrative mantra only when A.22.CGUS admits the represented conditional continuations as a `DemonstrativeUnfoldingSlice@Context`.

#### E.11:4.4.1 - Practical-use carry-through check

Check every published card over its public values. This check evaluates whether the card can lead a reader to the direct pattern and an exact result; it does not create a project instance or an applicability verdict.

```text
PracticalUseCarryThroughCheck:
  practicalUseKey: PracticalUseKeyValue
  practicalUseGuidanceRef: PracticalUseGuidance@FPFReadme
  publicSituationDescriptionRef: U.Episteme
  publicPracticalQuestionRef: PublicPracticalUseQuestion@FPFReadme

  ordinaryWalkthroughRef?: PublicOrdinaryWalkthrough@FPFReadme
  walkthroughSelectionRationaleRef: U.Episteme
  principalBlockedOverreadRef: PublicPatternUseBoundaryConditionTemplate@FPFReadme
```

Exactly one walkthrough reference is present. A demonstrative slice passes A.22.CGUS admission and identifies the included positions, C.33 structure-loss notes, alternatives or returns, direct patterns, and transition to the full pattern. An ordinary walkthrough carries its CGUS non-admission rationale. A local mantra inside it remains a compact reminder of the direct pattern's Solution; it does not acquire the Tech kind `DemonstrativeUnfoldingSlice@Context` merely because it is memorable or repeated.

Each candidate-use template passes only when it names one direct pattern, that pattern's Solution, the exact result kind, the relation signature when the kind admits a relation, every candidate-basis completeness condition, and the pattern that can receive the result. Reject a public project instance, a broad family in place of the result, or a PatternID list without selection conditions. The principal blocked overread states the most consequential false project claim that a reader could otherwise infer from the card.

#### E.11:4.5 - Fifteen stable practical-use keys


| Key | Public situation heading |
| --- | --- |
| `ARCHITECTURE` | Shape an architecture from a problem and competing characteristics |
| `WORKING-DOCUMENTS` | Create a working document that another participant can use |
| `OPTION-COMPARISON` | Compare options without hiding trade-offs |
| `PROBLEM-SHAPING` | Turn a vague concern into an accepted problem-side record |
| `IMPROVEMENT` | Improve a named object under an explicit evaluation |
| `COSTLY-ACTION` | Prepare a costly or hard-to-reverse action |
| `TIME` | Make a time-dependent claim usable |
| `CAUSAL-USE` | Decide what a causal claim may support |
| `DESCRIPTION-USE` | Use a description or view without confusing it with its subject |
| `NAMING` | Name a governed value so people can recover its meaning |
| `WORDING` | Repair wording that hides the object, relation, or claim kind |
| `MATHEMATICAL-MODELING` | Choose and bound a mathematical lens |
| `SOTA-PORTFOLIO` | Build a current state-of-the-art synthesis pack |
| `DPF-AUTHORING` | Build a domain or local FPF-grounded framework |
| `SYSTEM-IN-CONTEXT` | Delimit a system and its environment before architecture synthesis |

README owns the current public cards and their expansions. Preface explains why FPF's distinctions work together. ToC locates pattern families. Full patterns carry methods, conditions, costs, consequences, and exact result semantics. None is a second card store.

#### E.11:4.6 - Bounded comparison

When more than one card remains plausible, compare four things: recognizable-situation fit, difference among first results, direct pattern, and stop or return condition. Keep the comparison in conversation for ordinary bounded use. Open the most promising direct pattern before constructing a project candidate.

The comparison rationale has one public guidance subject and exists before a project candidate is constructed:

```text
PracticalUseCardComparisonRationale@Context <: U.Episteme:
  subjectGuidanceRef: PracticalUseGuidance@FPFReadme
  recognitionReasonDescriptionRef: U.Episteme
  firstResultDifferenceDescriptionRef: U.Episteme
  comparisonRationaleDescriptionRef: U.Episteme
```

Stop inspection when one card has enough recognition and first-result advantage to justify direct pattern inspection, when no remaining card can change the starting choice, or when the inspection budget opens an explicit return. No fixed maximum of three is inferred.

Materialize comparison history only when a named receiving use relies on it:

```text
PracticalUseCardShortlist@Context <: U.Episteme:
  namedRelianceConditionRef: U.Episteme
  receivingUseDescriptionRef: U.Episteme
  receivingUseGoverningPatternRef: U.MethodDescription

  firstResultTemplateRefs[1..*]: PublicPatternUseResultTemplate@FPFReadme
  firstResultDifferenceRationaleRef: PracticalUseCardComparisonRationale@Context
  inspectionDisposition: keep | defer | discard | startHere
```

Several plausible cards alone do not make this record current. The named reliance may be transfer, replay, audit, automation, or another use that needs addressable comparison history. Retain only the rows that use needs.

#### E.11:4.7 - Replay and currentness

Replay one public guidance claim from the current card and expansion, the edition-pinned direct `Solution`, the exact result kind and conditional relation signature, the readable coarsening row, the applicable boundary, and the selected walkthrough. The claim remains current only while the direct `Solution` still admits that result and the public situation and question still recognize the same use.

Recheck the smallest affected card slice when the direct `Solution`, result kind, relation signature, recognition condition, first-result difference, or boundary changes, or when use evidence shows a recurrent wrong turn. `G.11` governs edition, telemetry, currentness-window, and decay orchestration; E.11 supplies the card-specific values and change conditions that orchestration inspects.

### E.11:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### E.11:5.1 - Architecture or description?

A team says, "Our diagram no longer explains the system." `ARCHITECTURE` and `DESCRIPTION-USE` both look plausible. The first card offers an architecture question and selected-structure result; the second offers a description-use or representation-transition result.

The team compares the first-result difference, opens `C.30` and `E.17.0`, and discovers that the selected structure is unsettled. It starts with `ARCHITECTURE`. No shortlist record is needed because the comparison is local and reversible.

#### E.11:5.2 - Transfer needs comparison history

The receiving safety review relies on an addressable rationale for why two teams considered `TIME`, `COSTLY-ACTION`, `CAUSAL-USE`, and `SYSTEM-IN-CONTEXT` before a hazardous test, because it will replay the selection after new measurements arrive. The fourth card remains plausible while the test-object boundary, participation, or functioning relation is unsettled.

That named reliance admits a `PracticalUseCardShortlist@Context` with four comparison rows, the stop boundary, and the return condition. The shortlist does not authorize the test or replace evidence, assurance, gate, choice, or WorkPlan relations.

#### E.11:5.3 - A card leads to a physical result without promising it

`WORKING-DOCUMENTS` can lead to a usable machining work instruction. The card's direct result is a method description or WorkPlan, not the machined component. The public expansion names the exact first result and points to A.15 for later work.

The reader can therefore imagine useful progress without inferring that publication or planning performed the machining.

#### E.11:5.4 - Repair the smallest card slice after a direct result changes

Suppose a new `A.6.3.RT` edition makes `RepresentationSchemeTransitionRelation@Context` the exact first result for one `DESCRIPTION-USE` condition. Repair that candidate-use template, its exact result kind and conditional relation signature, its readable coarsening row, and any boundary whose condition changed. Recheck the linked walkthrough against the repaired result.

The public card heading and question remain unchanged when readers still recognize the same situation. Preface and ToC remain unchanged when framework rationale and retrieval location did not move. The `A.6.3.RT` pattern body remains the authority for the relation; E.11 repairs only the public guidance that points to it.

#### E.11:5.5 - A better first-click rate can make discovery worse

Suppose retrieval ranks the most familiar title first and the first-click rate rises. Follow-up comparison shows that more readers now open `DESCRIPTION-USE` when the selected structure is still unsettled, so first-result mismatch and wrong-turn returns also rise.

The visible navigation measure improved while the intended value worsened: readers reached a less suitable direct pattern more often. Keep first-click rate as telemetry, apply `E.13` to the substitution, and judge the guidance by recoverable situation fit, first-result fit, and wrong-turn cost rather than by the click measure alone.

### E.11:6 - Bias-Annotation

- **Title-match bias.** A familiar word selects a pattern before its Problem and first result are inspected. Compare situations and result differences, then open the direct pattern.
- **Public-instance bias.** A README example is filled with project values. Keep public templates context-free; project candidates belong to `E.11.PUA`.
- **Numbered-route bias.** Card order is read as method order. Use semantic keys and condition-specific continuations.
- **Record-first bias.** Comparison emits a shortlist by default. Materialize one only for a named receiving reliance.
- **Card-as-authority bias.** A public card is treated as applicability verdict, recommendation, decision, or authorization. Return to `E.11.PUR` or the direct subject pattern.

### E.11:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Check | Passing condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `E11-1` | Situation first | Card wording begins with a recognizable working situation before PatternIDs or internal topology. |
| `E11-2` | Exact first result | Every candidate template names a direct Solution, result kind, conditional signature, and receiving pattern. |
| `E11-3` | No fictitious context | Public card, expansion, templates, and walkthrough contain no reader-project `@Context` values. |
| `E11-4` | Complete public explanation | The carry-through check names exactly one admitted demonstrative slice or justified ordinary walkthrough, its selection rationale, and the principal blocked overread. |
| `E11-5` | Template completeness | Every candidate template names one direct Solution, exact result kind, kind-conditioned relation signature, complete basis positions, and receiving pattern. |
| `E11-6` | Bounded comparison | Comparison exposes first-result differences and a stop or return condition. |
| `E11-7` | Conditional shortlist | Every materialized shortlist names the receiving reliance that uses its history. |
| `E11-8` | Publication responsibility | README, Preface, ToC, retrieval, and full patterns do not maintain duplicate card bodies. |
| `E11-9` | Cold-reader recognition | A reader unfamiliar with FPF encounters the working situation and imaginable first result before internal vocabulary, while the expansion preserves the exact kind and boundary. |
| `E11-10` | Grounded public value | Every benefit claim exposes the concrete need, first useful result, specific direct-pattern distinction that changes the next project action, and direct pattern; the public set does not present FPF mainly as wording or description policing. |

### E.11:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Misuse | Why it fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pattern list as guidance | IDs do not show recognition conditions or result differences. | Publish situation, first result, direct Solution, and boundaries. |
| Internal vocabulary as the front door | The card starts with PatternIDs, FPF kinds, or quality and conformance terms before the reader can recognize the work. | Put the ordinary working situation and first useful result first, then restore precision in the expansion and direct pattern. |
| Ungrounded public value | The card promises broad help but shows no concrete first result or direct-pattern distinction that changes the next project action. | Name the project need, first useful result, the specific direct-pattern distinction that changes the next project action, and the direct pattern whose `Solution` governs obtaining that result. |
| Card as a form | Readers fabricate project facts before inspecting the pattern. | Keep the card context-free and defer local records to PUA under reliance. |
| Fixed three-card shortlist | Interface convenience becomes ontology. | Use any finite inspected set bounded by the current question and stop condition. |
| Walkthrough as workflow | Presentation order becomes a fixed work sequence. | State continuation conditions and use CGUS only when its structure is actually admitted. |
| README as pattern body | Public copy accumulates methods and conformance doctrine. | Link to the expansion and direct pattern; keep method authority there. |

### E.11:9 - Consequences

**Benefits.** FPF gains human-readable public practical-use guidance without losing exact result kinds or direct pattern authority. Readers can explore and recover from wrong turns. Ordinary use stays light, while transfer and replay can preserve comparisons.

**Costs.** Public guidance remains trustworthy only while the fifteen cards and their expansions stay synchronized with the direct patterns. Every readable result phrase needs an exact kind restoration. Reliance-bearing comparisons add explicit records and return conditions.

### E.11:10 - Rationale

Discovery is a bounded decision under limited attention, not a one-time lookup. A semantic card makes the practical question and first-result difference visible before the reader commits to a pattern. A recoverable return is more useful than pretending the first cue is always right.

Public guidance remains trustworthy only when it is weaker than the direct pattern. It helps a reader decide what to inspect; it does not decide applicability, authorize work, or create the promised result. This division also keeps public explanation teachable: simple phrases can remain visible because expansions restore exact kinds and relations.

### E.11:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Source or practice line | Problem-solving move taken here | Adoption and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Information-foraging and information-scent practice | Put recognizable situation and expected information gain before internal navigation structure. | Adopt through situation-first cards and first-result differences. Do not infer ontology or a fixed shortlist size. |
| Jin, Bai, and Oulasvirta, *Modeling Trial-and-Error Navigation With a Sequential Decision Model of Information Scent*, arXiv:2603.11759 (2026) | Treat inspection, premature selection, wrong turns, and backtracking as a bounded sequence under memory and time constraints. | Adapt through explicit stop, wrong-turn, and return boundaries. Materialize history only for named reliance; the preprint does not establish a universal discovery record. |
| Zhu, Reinecke, and Mitra, *Language Scent: Exploring Cross-Language Information Navigation*, arXiv:2604.03604 (2026) | Keep contextual cues near the governed value while preserving the exact target behind a reader-facing expression. | Adapt to public cue and expansion design. The small study does not establish universal label equivalence or decide FPF ontology. |
| Current FPF E.8, E.17, F.17, F.18, and E.11.PUA | Separate public recognition, publication, naming, and project pattern use. | Adopt as the governing patterns for their stated relations. E.11 defines only the public guidance and reliance-conditioned comparison layer. |

The practitioner implication is concrete: inspect a small plausible set, compare the results each would produce, and keep a durable history only when someone will use it later.

Information-foraging is the lineage anchor, not by itself the current competitive claim. Familiar-title lookup and popularity ranking are the common comparator: they are cheap cues, but E.11 rejects either as the sole selection basis because neither exposes first-result differences or a recoverable return.

The two 2026 studies are current preprint anchors rather than settled consensus. Reopen the bounded-navigation adaptation when peer review, replication, or use evidence changes the observed role of inspection, memory, backtracking, or wrong-turn cost. Reopen the language-scent adaptation when broader studies show that in-situ cues obscure the governed target more often than they help readers recover it. `G.11` orchestrates those currentness and telemetry checks; E.11 changes the affected card cues, comparison, or boundaries.

### E.11:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `E.8` for pattern recognition text, `E.17.AUD` for publication-unit discipline, `F.17` and `F.18` for published terms and naming, and `C.2.1` for public helper epistemes.
- **Leads to:** `E.11.PUA` for applying one selected pattern and `E.11.PUR` for local applicability, recommendation, and coordination.
- **Coordinates with:** `A.22.CGUS` for demonstrative slices, `E.18` for flow-local results, `G.11` for currentness orchestration, and each direct pattern cited by a public template.

### E.11:End
