## E.19 - Pattern Quality Gates: Review and Refresh Profiles

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

### E.19:0 - Use this when

Use `E.19` when you need to decide whether one new, substantially revised, or aging FPF pattern is ready for admission, refresh, or return for repair. It turns quality review into a repeatable pattern-quality run rather than a matter of reviewer taste.

Use it especially when a draft looks structurally compliant but may still fail on first-minute usability, primary `EntityOfConcern` stability, terminology, SoTA grounding, related-pattern boundaries, examples, anti-patterns, or shipping-facing authority claims.

**Not this pattern when.** Use `E.8` to write the pattern body. Use `E.9` to record the content decision that explains why FPF should change. Use `E.9.DA` when the question is whether one concrete `DRR` is adequate for a declared downstream authoring use before drafting or host amendment. Use `E.23` when the aim is repeated quality improvement against an object-under-improvement evaluation rather than one admission or refresh review profile. Use local patterns for the domain rule or constraint being reviewed. Use project gate or release patterns when the question is whether a project publication, work-result record, or release candidate passes a delivery gate rather than whether an FPF pattern is mature. `E.19` reviews whether an FPF pattern remains useful action guidance; it does not certify the world, the project, the publication, or the release.

### E.19:0.1 - What goes wrong if missed

Review collapses into heading compliance or personal taste. A draft can pass because it has the right headings while still being hard for a practitioner to recognise, too thin against current practice, unclear about its primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, or claim record, or misleading about related governing patterns and authority claims.

### E.19:0.2 - What this buys

`E.19` gives authors, reviewers, and stewards a shared review profile: what must be checked, how deep the check should go, which defects block admission or refresh, and what evidence is needed before a pattern-quality claim is made. It also makes the recognition text visible before the heavier assurance machinery begins.

**First useful move.** Name the pattern-quality review or refresh claim, run baseline triage over the reviewed pattern or subset, and add only the risk-selected profiles needed by the present ontology, usability, SoTA, boundary, naming, or authority risk.

**Local-repair boundary.** If baseline triage shows that the current review question has no present ontology, usability, SoTA, boundary, naming, or authority risk beyond a small mechanical repair, close with that repair direction. Do not run every profile just because `E.19` exists, and do not claim an `E.21` quality value unless `E.21` has evaluated the pattern version over its required coordinate set.

**Primary EntityOfConcern in plain terms.** The primary `EntityOfConcern` is one FPF pattern-quality review or refresh claim: the reviewed pattern text, the selected profile, the defects found or cleared, and the boundary of the admission or refresh decision.

**Primary working reader.** The first reader is an FPF reviewer, with the pattern author close behind. The review must still be answerable to the eventual practitioner or manager who will rely on the admitted pattern.

### E.19:1 - Problem frame

FPF evolves by adding and revising patterns. Over time, the framework accumulates two kinds of risk:

1. **Admission risk** — a newly authored pattern can be structurally compliant yet still fail on ontology, semantics, terminology conflicts and vagueness, scope, SoTA in related disciplines, or cross-context hygiene.

2. **Staleness risk** — older patterns can remain internally consistent while drifting away from contemporary practice and newer parts of FPF, current internal vocabulary, or updated related governing patterns. The result is “quiet decay”: the pattern still appears clear, but becomes misleading, incomplete, or incompatible.

FPF already contains many checklists and constraints, but they are distributed across patterns and suites. Authors and reviewers therefore lack a single, repeatable way to answer: *What should be checked, and how deep, before a pattern is admitted or kept?*

### E.19:2 - Problem

Without a unified, explicit review pattern:

* Different reviewers optimize for formal or template compliance and miss deeper ontological, semantic, and naming issues, producing bureaucratic output that does not improve the enforceable Conformance Checklist.
* Authors “optimize for the visible checklist” and miss hidden requirements (lexical discipline, Bridge hygiene, SoTA‑Echoing quality, scope claims, delta‑class impact).
* Older patterns accumulate conceptual staleness and diverge from current practice, current terminology, or current internal invariants.
* The specification's normative content becomes harder to trust: compliance becomes a matter of reviewer taste rather than a repeatable gate.

### E.19:3 - Forces

| Force                                   | Tension                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Uniformity vs Fit**                   | One universal checklist is simple ↔ different pattern kinds carry different risks.  |
| **Rigor vs Editorial cost**             | Deep audits increase quality ↔ they must remain feasible for routine updates.       |
| **Stability vs Evolution**              | Canon should stay stable ↔ it must absorb new SoTA and correct mistakes.            |
| **Conceptual purity vs Enforceability** | Core must stay implementation-agnostic ↔ gates must still be actionable and auditable.     |
| **Local meaning vs Reuse**              | Patterns must remain context-bound ↔ authors want to reuse ideas across domains. |
| **Freshness vs timelessness**           | Some claims should be evergreen ↔ others decay and must be refreshed on cadence.    |

### E.19:4 - Solution — Profile-based gates for admission and refresh

Establish **Pattern Quality Gates (PQG)**: a conceptual review mechanism that applies **profiles of checks** rather than a single monolithic checklist.

A **Pattern Check Profile (PCP)** is a named bundle of check families. Profiles are **additive**: every review applies a baseline profile, then adds risk-driven profiles as needed.

**Terminology note (disambiguation).** PQG and PCP are editorial review constructs in the authoring plane (Part E). They are distinct from enactment and runtime gating constructs such as `OperationalGate(profile)`, `GateProfile`, and `GateDecision` (A.21), which govern Work transitions and gate decision policies elsewhere in FPF.

**Mint vs reuse.** This pattern mints **PQG**, **PCP**, and the profile IDs `PCP-BASE`, `PCP-MOD`, `PCP-PRAG`, `PCP-NORM`, `PCP-SOTA`, `PCP-BRIDGE`, `PCP-SUITE`, `PCP-P2W`, `PCP-TERM`, `PCP-DEONT`, `PCP-REFRESH`, and `PCP-ENTRY`. It reuses existing FPF terms (e.g., **Delta‑Class**, **DRR**, **Bridge**, **CL**, **SoTA Synthesis Pack**) without changing their meanings.

#### E.19:4.1 - Define the reviewed pattern or subset

Name the exact reviewed pattern or landing subset, its edition or other stable version basis, the admission or refresh question, and the baseline and risk-selected profile questions that are in scope. Profile choice narrows review depth; it does not turn the selected questions into a progress record.

**Choose one review form.** An `E.19` review has two forms:

1. **Inspect, repair, and verify.** The same work inspects every selected question, repairs each in-scope defect in the reviewed pattern or subset, and performs a focused verification. The changed pattern or subset and that verification carry the result. A separate findings record is made only for an unresolved blocker, a decision that cannot be made within the current authority, or a transfer to another author.
2. **Independent findings.** The reviewer does not change the reviewed pattern or subset. One findings result or handoff records every actionable defect and blocker, with repair direction precise enough for the author to act without repeating the diagnosis.

A selected question that reveals no defect requires no durable pass entry. Independent review does not accumulate positive recitals, and inspect-repair-verify does not duplicate completed repairs in a parallel findings record. If another governing pattern requires a reusable value or decision—such as an `E.21` coordinate, a `DRR` decision, or a landing result—that value belongs to the result required by that pattern rather than to an `E.19` progress account. The local work method may provide transient attention markers; `E.19` governs the substantive questions and outcomes, not how those markers survive an agent's working context.

**Complete the selected scope.** Inspect every independently answerable question in the declared baseline and risk-selected scope. The first defect, blocker, or already-negative admission conclusion may prevent a positive verdict, but it does not complete the review and does not suppress findings that remain independently obtainable. Stop before the selected scope is complete only when a missing source, missing authority, unsafe boundary, or equivalent condition makes the remaining questions impossible to judge truthfully or safely. In that case, record the unexamined scope and why it cannot be judged; do not present the partial findings set as complete.

A nontrivial pattern-quality review SHOULD state its quality-evaluation purpose before depth is selected. Use `E.22` or an equivalent compact question frame to say whether this review is a `floorEvaluation`, `exceptionalImprovementEvaluation`, `paretoTradeoffEvaluation`, `openQuestionDiscoveryEvaluation`, `absorptionEvaluation`, or a declared combination. If the purpose is absent, `E.19` treats the review as an admission-refresh blocker read, not as a request to raise every evaluated coordinate toward exceptional expression. When coordinate values, `PatternQualityStatus`, or all-`4`/all-`5` claims are needed for one pattern version, the review opens or consumes an `E.21` result instead of assigning those values inside `E.19`.

When the review opens or consumes `E.21`, `E.19` treats `E.21` as a hard pattern-quality evaluation, not as a selectable profile. The review must not accept an `E.21` claim that omits required coordinates, omits `ShortRationale`, omits `PrecisionRestorationProfile`, uses inactive/triggered-coordinate language, narrows the requested use to make the result pass, or replaces coordinate values with blocker triage. In inspect-repair-verify, repair or re-evaluate the affected result where that work is in scope; in independent findings, record the exact defect. Baseline triage can answer only the `E.19` review boundary when no `E.21` quality value, all-`4`/all-`5` claim, landing-quality claim, or pattern-improvement movement claim is being made.

If the aim is repeated improvement against an object-under-improvement evaluation, use `E.23` for the repeated method. `E.19` may supply a review profile and findings inside that loop, but the profile is not the loop method and the review result is not a quality value until the object-under-improvement evaluation evaluates the changed pattern version.

`E.19` reviewer and reviewed-pattern wording is FPF pattern-quality gate wording. It governs FPF admission, refresh, return-for-repair, blocker, and review-profile claims, not `E.21` coordinate assignment and not project-side publication interpretation, explanation interpretation, comparative review-unit use, or participation in a named project-side review relation. When those project-side relations are used, use the publication or project-side pattern that names the object being interpreted or reviewed.

**Project-side reuse boundary.** Use this boundary when an `E.19` pattern-quality result is being reused as project certification, project evidence, safety-assurance material, gate input, release justification, compliance-assurance material, assurance material, work authority, or publication truth. The first E.19 move is to return the result to the governing FPF pattern-quality claim it reviews: admission, refresh, repair return, or selected pattern-quality boundary. If that result is cited for a project-side claim, the project-side governing relation must be opened for that claim named by value: `A.10` for evidence/currentness, `B.3` for assurance, `A.20` for local CV status, `A.21` for gate decision, `A.15` for work, or another governing pattern when that claim needs one. The review result may be evidence about FPF pattern quality; it is not certification of the project world. Plain wording in the reviewed text remains ordinary unless it changes admissible use, evidence, gate, assurance, work, decision, or FPF pattern application.

**Common wrong first interpretation.** Pattern review passed means the project, release, publication, safety claim, or compliance claim is certified. First honest entry: E.19 returns only a pattern-quality result; any project-side reuse must name the project-side governing relation and its evidence or assurance source.

**Misuse guard.** A pattern-quality caution, return-for-repair result, or selected pattern-quality boundary result cannot be reused as project refusal or project approval unless a project-side governing relation states admissible and non-admissible use for that relation.

Formal or template defects (e.g. non-compliance with E.8 structure or not conforming to RFC deontic terminology) have lower review priority than semantic or ontological defects or non-SoTA Solutions. In inspect-repair-verify, repair them within the declared boundary; in independent findings, record them with concrete repair direction.

E.g. if the header block is missing or incomplete, **continue with ontology and semantic review first**. Treat missing header fields as one mechanical defect, not as a reason to stop (PCP-BASE #7).

When a proposed or accepted change needs a best-known **Delta-Class (Δ-0…Δ-3)** and initial **impact radius**, place them in the governing change, decision, or landing result using existing definitions where available (e.g., the LEX-AUTH protocol). `E.19` repairs or reports an omission that matters to the selected gate; it does not copy a successful change account into a second review record.

#### E.19:4.2 - Apply the baseline profile to every run

Every run MUST include **PCP‑BASE** as a triage baseline. Full-depth checking
is selected only where the relevant risk is present; reviewer depth SHOULD
prioritize the FPF-governed sections and enforceable requirements in E.19:4.2.1.

1. **Internal coherence (problem <-> conformance claim <-> solution)**
   The Conformance Checklist matches Problem statement and the Solution (no "orphan requirements" and no "unclaimed requirements").
2. **Lexical discipline & reserved vocabulary**
   Terms and registers follow lexical rules; ambiguous "everyday" synonyms do not silently replace kernel vocabulary.
3. **SoTA-Echoing minimum compliance (E.8)**
   SoTA-Echoing satisfies the E.8 authoring requirements applicable to the pattern kind (Architectural vs Definitional), including explicit adopt/adapt/reject stances and the E.8 two-part SoTA test: current best-known problem-solving practice for the named practice question, and by-value incorporation into FPF-governed pattern loci. If a SoTA Synthesis Pack exists for the topic, SoTA-Echoing binds to it rather than forking an untracked narrative; any divergence of pattern norms from contemporary practice is explicitly stated as such. SoTA-Echoing **MUST** be non-decorative, **MUST** reflect best-known current practice rather than official status, source recency, institutional adoption, or merely popular defaults for the declared problem, and **MUST** govern the Solution and other FPF-governed sections, or those sections **MUST** justify divergence explicitly.
4. **Cross-pattern compatibility & impact radius**
   Relations are consistent with declared dependencies and dependents; declared scope/impact is compatible or explicitly limited.
5. **Didactic grounding**
   Archetypal Grounding is present and teaches the concept with concrete cases or references, not only abstractions.
6. **Reader-fit**
   The pattern body stays addressed to the intended FPF user rather than to FPF developers, package architects, reviewers, evaluators, or release/projection carriers. FPF-governed sections explain admissible use, costs, boundaries, FPF governing patterns named by value, project-side FPF kinds and references named by value, and related relations named by value in user terms. Architecture placement, freeze or merge state, package-boundary rationale, reference boilerplate, quality or projection evidence, corpus-entry evidence, `PatternQualityStatus`, monolith-parity evidence, landing evidence, and broader package-development rationale stay in `DRR`, architecture documents, review handoff, `E.21` result, `E.19` findings, README, ToC, `E.11`, `I.2`, cards, retrieval or projection carriers, release or landing evidence carriers, companions, or ordinary references unless they change the working reader's first admissible move.
7. **Template & section integrity**
   This is lowest priority for review depth and **SHOULD NOT** consume effort that would displace ontology, semantics, modularity, slot discipline, or SoTA checks.
8. **Modularity & contradiction hygiene**
   The pattern **SHOULD NOT** be overloaded or significantly expand requirements or dependencies without an explicit reason and impact record.
   Checks include: scope containment, split/refactor recommendations when warranted, and contradiction scans against neighbor patterns in Relations.
   The pattern SHOULD balance cohesion and coupling across FPF.
   If the pattern defines specialization or an abstraction stack, it SHOULD NOT mix slot interfaces or parameters from different abstraction positions; use explicit `⊑/⊑⁺` or `Uses` cuts instead.
9. **Substantive solution and locus adequacy**
   Baseline triage includes a small reviewed-pattern-specific question set about the actual problem and current change: does the pattern still solve the stated problem, are decision loci and governing-pattern applications correct, are kind boundaries and selected companion or projection functions preserved, did anything get worse, are SoTA rows current enough for the claim they discipline, and is the support material required by that claim neither too thin nor too heavy?
10. **Triggered method, performer, work, and result separation**
   When a method-bearing Solution prescribes actual work or world-side change, the run independently verifies the intended reader, method episteme, admitted performing `U.System` and current role assignment, a dated Work occurrence admitted under `U.Work`, and problem-facing result. The run returns a finding when the pattern episteme, checklist, reader role, plan, or prose is made to perform the work, or when work and result are collapsed. Judgment-only guidance does not trigger fictive performer or work requirements.

##### E.19:4.2.1 - Triage: spend depth on FPF-governed sections without making reviews heavier

PQG is meant to increase *semantic and ontological trust*, not to turn every review into an exhaustive editorial audit on form. To keep reviews feasible while improving the important parts:

* Treat **FPF-governed sections and deontic requirements** as the primary depth loci:
  * the pattern’s **Problem frame**, **Rationale**, and **worked slices** when a new family, profile, or specialization would otherwise be intelligible only from project context,
  * reader fit in **Problem**, **Solution**, **Consequences**, **Rationale**, and worked slices whenever the draft risks mixing user guidance with package-development rationale,
  * the pattern’s **Conformance Checklist** (the enforceable conformance check set): keep items universal, cognitively ergonomic, not overly prohibitive, and avoid duplicating checks that belong to other patterns (modularity),
  * **deontic clauses** (`MUST/SHALL/SHOULD/MAY`) that define requirements on the authoring/validation plane (not laws of nature or mathematical facts; ensure an explicit conformance subject),
  * **admissibility constraints** (`Invariant:` / `Well-formedness constraint:`) that define valid models (cardinality, typing/kinds, totality) and are written as non-deontic predicates (no RFC keywords inside the predicate),
  * **definitions and mint/reuse decisions** (new terms, renamed terms, scope claims baked into names, names that are not overloaded and are properly chosen),
  * **cross-context and cross-plane claims** (Bridge hygiene and “sameness” assertions),
  * **SoTA** (when the pattern claims state-of-the-art rather than a popular-but-outdated solution or vocabulary),
  * **substantive solution and locus adequacy**: one reviewed-pattern-specific content pass checks whether the repaired text still solves the stated problem, assigns claim-bearing material to the correct governing loci named by value, preserves kind boundaries and selected companion or projection functions, keeps quality/projection evidence and executor/reviewer correspondence out of the pattern unless the pattern's own `EntityOfConcern` and user-facing action are that evaluation/projection work, and has not become either under-grounded or over-bureaucratic,
  * **modularity and Slot discipline of A.6.5** that provide evolvability of FPF,
  * **absence of contradictions in a pattern**,
  * **Relations** that define compatibility and impact radius.
* Treat **low-signal text** as “quick-pass” unless it changes meaning: headings, micro-typos, stylistic polish, and non-FPF-governed narrative refactors, including RFC-form deontic cleanup.
* **Do not block semantic review on template and RFC compliance defects.** Missing header block fields (E.8 H-5), missing canonical sections, or a missing footer marker are fixable integrity defects. Record them as repair items and continue with the FPF-governed section checks in the same run.
* **Sentence-level precision matters on FPF-governed prose.** Reviewers SHOULD inspect FPF-governed sentences for generic heads, claim-bearing qualifiers, overloaded trigger words, bare relation shorthand, and hidden process/API metaphors. The default repair order is: restore head kind, then qualifier claim kind or admissible-use boundary, then comparison criterion or escalation condition homogeneity, and only then judge whether a later Plain or coarsened rendering is admissible. This is an MG-DA cold-reader check: after repair, a reader without the `DRR`, campaign notes, or reviewer memory must be able to state the object, kind, relation or claim kind, admissible use, and next governing pattern. Broad replacements such as `object`, `item`, `value`, `relation`, `record`, `condition`, `basis`, `material`, or unqualified `specialization` remain defects unless the specific object, relation position, and governing pattern are named; specialization wording must say what specializes what, by which specialization relation, and which inherited or changed slots or uses matter.
* **Precision-restoration distribution must be preserved.** When an `E.10` scan selects a non-local precision-restoration path, the run checks that `E.10` remains the trigger and applicability pattern, `E.10.ARCH` carries the shared recovery architecture, the relevant realization pattern (`A.6.P`, `C.2.P`, `C.30.P`, `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, `A.19.SPR`, or another selected restoration pattern) performs the ontological unpacking, and affected patterns keep thin declarative pointers rather than local trigger registries or duplicate recovery algorithms.
* **EntityOfConcern and precision-restoration questions travel with the same triage.** When the reviewed change touches EntityOfConcern, same-referent, slot/reference, alignment-path, role-boundary, consumer-disposition wording, description/publication-use guards, phrase apparatus, repeated boundary doctrine, architecture-placement rationale, package-boundary rationale, or quality/projection evidence, the run asks before acceptance: what is the pattern's own `EntityOfConcern` and first useful move; does the text state this pattern's own subject kind, action spine, practical delta, and bounded non-use before auxiliary material; which governing pattern carries any outside claim/relation/boundary; does the prose need `F.19` before word/head/use restoration; do remaining word/head/use problems apply `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `F.18`, or another relation named by value pattern; do role, method, work, evidence, assurance, gate, and decision claims remain with their governing patterns; and has every current-host consumer of the selected-family repair received a semantic, mechanical, compatibility, or not-triggered disposition. When `E.21` is active, these questions are recorded through its `PrecisionRestorationProfile` rather than as separate local E.19 rows.

* **Design-time and run-time both count.** The same precision discipline applies to FPF pattern prose and to any reviewed publication text, worked slice, or performed-work exemplar when that text is being assessed for admissibility, guidance, reuse, gating, release, policy, assurance, or action-selection use.
* **Report ordering (impact-first).** In run outputs and remediation direction, prioritize findings on ontology, semantic, modularity and SoTA-related FPF-governed sections first; group low-signal formatting/typos into one compact tail finding unless they change meaning.

#### E.19:4.3 - Add risk-driven profiles

**PCP‑PRAG (Pragmatic utility & adoption)** — Trigger: the pattern is Normative and claims practice guidance.
Checks include: a visible first-reading recognition text early enough for a cold working reader; a recognisable first-minute working situation; one short `Use this when` or equivalent entry; a plain statement of what goes wrong if the pattern is missed; a plain statement of what the pattern buys in practice; the first admissible action-guiding move the user should take; a visible ordinary `not this pattern when` boundary; a minimally viable example; non-decorative Consequences/Anti-Patterns; at least one worked slice when the pattern is easy to misuse; a visible assurance text carrying declaration, guidance/check, modeling, and review/check scope; reader-fit consistency so that the assurance text does not silently widen or universalize the recognition-text claim; explicit practical payoff in user-facing prose; a short user-facing statement of the primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, or claim record and any minimal modeling lens when typed declaration material has FPF-governed use; nearby pairwise plain glosses for FPF-governed technical terms that appear before the heavier harness; a short working-reader implication for any `SoTA-Echoing` rows that carry explanatory work plus visible linkage to the worked cases or boundary slices they discipline; explicit primary working reader, concern, and viewpoint fields when several working-reader situations are being served; an explicit `So what?` adoption test; and, when the pattern claims universal or transdisciplinary reach, at least three heterogeneous recognition-text situations with `F.16` preferred as the compact example-matrix template.
If an `E.10` trigger scan selects epistemic precision restoration during admission or refresh, `PCP-PRAG` treats type-correct-but-inert wording as a usability defect governed by `E.2` `P-2` and `E.12`: the run must name the remaining admissible reader use or the FPF pattern application and governing ontology that carry the claim, and must confirm any Plain recognition line maps back to the recovered Tech reading when both registers are used. A more expressive recognition line or intentional didactic metaphor may stay ordinary when it carries no FPF-governed use; when it carries ontological, evidence, causal, assurance, bridge, gate, work, decision, or admissibility claim kind or admissible-use boundary, that claim kind or admissible-use boundary must be recoverable through the recovered Tech reading or named FPF pattern application.

For a broad cleanup across several patterns, or any cleanup that touches FPF-governed Problem frames, Problem sections, first-use recognition text, archetypal grounding, examples, or worked slices, check whether the didactic function was harmed. In inspect-repair-verify, restore the working situation and first useful move or the named FPF pattern application and governing ontology that carry the claim; in independent findings, record the exact harm and repair direction. A positive `improved` or `preserved` account is required only when another governing evaluation makes that value one of its substantive results, and it belongs in that evaluation.

**PCP‑MOD (Modularity and abstraction-boundary discipline)** — Trigger: the reviewed pattern or subset shows scope creep or abstraction-boundary mixing (e.g., one pattern bundles universal core rules with frame-specific content and discipline-specific method semantics; or it mixes EntityOfConcern, Description, and Specification positions in one object).

Checks include:

* an explicit **core vs extensions** cut (universal invariants are factored into one stable “core”, and extensions reference it rather than re-stating or mutating it),
* no conflation of **specialization vs dependency**: use `⊑/⊑⁺` for refinement/extension and `Uses` for pipelines; do not mix their semantics,
* no conflation of package-form, governing-pattern relation, and package-relation functions: **Pack vs Kit vs Suite vs Family vs Bundle vs Cluster vs Profile vs Overlay vs Record vs Umbrella** are not interchanged, and the review states carrier status, governing-pattern relation, and package relation explicitly instead of leaving it implicit or varying it for style,
* description-lane descriptions and their publications do not grow mechanism semantics; MVPK faces remain projections and do not become "the place of truth",
* slot-discipline hygiene for any ordered specialization set: SlotKind invariance is preserved and inherited operations do not gain new mandatory inputs (A.6.5 / A.6.1 specialization discipline).

**PCP‑REFRESH (Staleness & compatibility refresh)** — Trigger: staleness signals are present (e.g., outdated SoTA rows, renamed/superseded Relations entries, terminology drift, or an explicit refresh window in LAT/DRR).
Checks include:

* refresh‑sensitive claims are identified (time‑bounded or ecosystem‑bounded) and either (a) updated with post‑2015 evidence **and** matching Solution changes, or (b) explicitly scope‑limited and labeled as historical lineage,
* Relations are updated to current pattern IDs; deprecations/renames are handled via explicit continuity notes (no silent relabeling),
* when one new or substantially revised pattern subset is being prepared for send or landing, inspect the related governing patterns, governing-pattern constraints, companion patterns, Relations entries, and monolith-backed pattern sections that may require aligned edits. Repair an in-scope mismatch or return it as a finding. Successful alignment remains visible in the changed sources and the governing landing or release result, not in an E.19 pass recital,
* any long-lived companion, profile, check sheet, pattern-local companion row, review harness, or analogous selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair kept with the reviewed pattern or subset states its use question, governing pattern or selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair, admissible companion-only use, one real breakage if absent, and demotion or deletion condition when no such breakage exists.
* when the refresh causes Δ‑2/Δ‑3, verify that the governing change or decision result carries its Delta‑Class, impact radius, `DRR` pointer, and any refresh and Bridge obligations required by E.15/F.15/F.9; repair or report an omission rather than copying a successful account into E.19,

Trigger overrides are permitted but intentionally rare. Override a triggered profile only when its risk is genuinely absent in this case and a compensating check covers the live concern. When the override changes an admission, refresh, or other governing decision, place its reason in that decision basis; otherwise E.19 requires no separate positive override account.

**PCP‑NORM (Normative guidance integrity)** — Trigger: the pattern introduces or changes normative requirements, introduces new conformance items, or shifts downstream requirements.
Checks include:

* **Delta‑Class (Δ‑0…Δ‑3)** and **impact radius** are explicit (what breaks, who depends on this),
* requirements are testable in principle (conceptually), scoped, and non-contradictory,
* downstream patterns cited in Relations are compatible with the new guidance.
* where the change is Δ‑2/Δ‑3 or a new normative pattern is being admitted: a DRR exists and references the PQG findings (pointer is sufficient; no duplicated prose).

**PCP‑SOTA (Evidence and SoTA alignment)** — Trigger: the pattern’s Solution asserts “best practice”, “state-of-the-art”, or introduces new synthesis claims.
Checks include:

* each “best practice” claim or SoTA claim in the Solution is explicitly **bound** to SoTA‑Echoing rows (or to SoTA Synthesis Pack identifiers when used), rather than floating as ungrounded prescription, and those rows identify best-known current practice rather than popularity alone,
* the selected SoTA practice or source set answers the declared working problem and the relevant domain or practice tradition rather than merely justifying package placement, naming neatness, or pattern clustering,
* each SoTA row changes at least one FPF-governed outcome for the pattern: what the user may do, what the user must not over-read, which FPF pattern application must be named, or which claim cannot be raised to release, policy, assurance, gate, action-selection, or adjudication use,
* novel synthesis is not presented as established SoTA: it is either (a) framed as a scoped hypothesis with explicit limits, or (b) promoted into or registered as a SoTA Synthesis Pack entry before the pattern is admitted as normative guidance; a merely explanatory SoTA note that leaves the FPF-governed sections untouched is non-conforming,
* where traditions disagree substantively, the pattern makes the disagreement visible and states whether it adopts, adapts, or rejects each relevant source idea instead of silently selecting one tradition,
* retrieval or benchmark methods are used only when the relevant evidence relation is present; their dimensions do not become universal pattern-quality benchmarks,
* refresh‑sensitive claims (those likely to decay) are explicitly marked with scope limits, timespan notes, or lineage labeling when appropriate.

**PCP‑BRIDGE (Cross-context or cross-plane reuse integrity)** — Trigger: the pattern imports claims, terms, or norms across contexts, disciplines, or reference planes.
Checks include:

* explicit Bridge usage where required (no silent identity by spelling),
* Congruence and loss are made explicit where applicable,
* any cross-plane reuse is explicitly acknowledged and its penalties do not leak into unrelated assurances.

**PCP‑SUITE (Mechanism-suite integrity)** — Trigger: the reviewed pattern or subset introduces or revises a suite-level Description that enumerates multiple distinct mechanisms (e.g., `MechSuiteDescription` or a suite specialization) and/or changes suite requirements, conformance pins, or suite protocols.
Checks include:

* the suite remains a **Description-level** object: it enumerates member `U.Mechanism.EntityOfConcern` refs and declares shared requirements/pins, but does **not** define mechanism blocks (`OperationAlgebra`, `Transport`, `Audit`, …) and is not used as a mechanism node,
* membership has **set semantics**: `mechanisms` is duplicates-free and order carries no semantics; any intended ordering is expressed only in `suite_protocols`,
* suite protocols are **closed over membership**: if `suite_protocols` is present, each protocol step references a member mechanism (no “step points outside the suite”),
* the suite is not a family of implementations: it MUST NOT be encoded as a `MechFamilyDescription` (families remain “many realizations of one mechanism”, not “many mechanisms”),
* the suite does **not** mint transport exceptions: any cross-context, cross-plane, or cross-kind requirement remains Bridge-only; loss or penalty handling stays with `R/R_eff` only; the suite does not embed CL/Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane tables (references/pins only),
* CG/CN authority pins remain explicit references to the single governance card and legality gate: if suite protocols include numeric comparison/aggregation/scoring, they cite `CG‑Spec` (SCP + Γ-fold + MinimalEvidence) and (where applicable) `CN‑Spec`, rather than duplicating “local CG‑Spec-like” content,
* suite protocols contain **no hidden tails**: if UNM/UINDM/ULSAM are required, the protocol expresses them as explicit `Uses` steps and suite audit requirements cite the chosen mechanism ids/refs (no “implicit normalization/aggregation inside score/compare/select”),
* gate separation is preserved: mechanisms and guards use tri-state `GuardDecision := {pass|degrade|abstain}` and MUST NOT publish `GateDecision` or `DecisionLog`; `block` remains gate-level only (`OperationalGate(profile)`),
* defaults remain single-sourced: portfolio mode, dominance regime, and unknown/failure behavior are either pinned in `TaskSignature` or one policy-assignment record, or not claimed; the suite does not define competing defaults,
* when the suite claims reusable outputs, publish/telemetry is explicit and terminates via existing publication forms/faces (e.g., G.10 and/or PTM), not as a hidden tail inside a selection step.

**PCP‑P2W (Planned baseline & slot-fillings seam integrity)** — Trigger: the reviewed pattern or subset introduces or revises planned-filling content in one exact `U.WorkPlan` against an exact governed declaration member, including a publication or view of that content.
Checks include:

* `SlotFillingsPlanItem` remains declaration-local `PlanItem` content inside one exact `U.WorkPlan` ClaimGraph; it is not a U-kind, execution log, mechanism, independent record, relation occurrence, or second slot ontology,
* every relied-on row names the intended-performance designator, exact declaration edition, declaration-local member designator and family, the direct pattern that owns the member's reusable meaning and corresponding later actual-use predicate, the positive planned value or designation, the target declaration's effective designation rule and semantic cardinality, and the exact planning conditions; A.15.2/A.15.3, not the target owner, govern the intended-use claim,
* declaration families remain distinct: relation-participant rows target only `SlotSpec`s in exact `RelationSignature` editions, operation rows target exact A.6.1 `ArgumentDeclaration`s or `ResultDeclaration`s, and any other row targets an explicitly governed declaration member with a corresponding actual-use predicate; a method description, kit or suite description, schema field, card, checklist, interface form, database field, or generic slot-bearing description is not a target merely because it displays a field,
* target-declared cardinality remains operative: for a single-valued target, exact conditions and an exact resolution rule make at most one planned value effective for any one intended use; multivalued set, order, repetition, or multiplicity semantics are never inferred from row count or layout,
* a row is positive intended-use content; omission is open-world, while prohibition, exclusion, required absence, and completeness remain separately governed plan claims rather than empty fillers or negated references,
* planned filling stays plan content: a planned value, compatible ValueKind, matching token, WorkPlan, or PlanItem establishes no dated work, obtaining relation participant, operation application, argument or result binding, returned value, change, production, delivery, acceptance, or outcome,
* when later actual use is compared with the plan, the direct relation predicate or exact A.6.1 application-binding predicate must obtain independently; a missing-filler or negative comparison requires an applicable closure or negative criterion and exact case facts; the comparison preserves the cited WorkPlan edition and expresses substitution or variance as a neighboring governed claim rather than backfilling the plan,
* declaration-edition pins, planned-value-edition pins, concrete reference kinds, time, location, capability, readiness, gate, evidence, source-currentness, bridge, publication, baseline, or comparison conditions appear only when the named receiving use relies on them; every policy or reference has its concrete kind, owner, edition, applicability, and effective reference scheme when current, and the profile introduces no unconditional crossing, time-selector, scope, audit-pin, or context bundle,
* a card, table, view, index, or generated summary is read-only publication of selected WorkPlan claim content: it does not add planned fillings, defaults, declaration meanings, cardinality, conditions, baseline semantics, or a second row authority, and
* when no reusable declaration member is needed, lower to ordinary A.15.2 plan content; when the declaration member, reusable meaning, corresponding later actual-use predicate, or direct owner cannot be recovered, return the exact missing-governor blocker rather than manufacturing a SlotSpec, description wrapper, generic field declaration, or actual-use relation.
**PCP-TERM (Terminology & naming protocol)** — Trigger: the pattern introduces new terms, new U-kind pressure, new governed value names, new “unified names”, redefines existing labels, leans on FPF-governed phrases whose head kind or qualifier claim kind or admissible-use boundary is not yet restored, or uses FPF-governed trigger wording as if the word itself carried the needed kind.
Checks include:

* the “mint vs reuse” decision is explicit when a term is introduced or changed,
* naming follows the local-first naming protocol and avoids scope smuggling (roles, metrics, or stages baked into labels; overloaded words used as terms with a local sense). Remediation **SHOULD** use F.18,
* when PCP-TERM is selected, `F.18` winner selection and `A.6.P` follow-through form one chain: inspect the candidate heads or phrases, kind conflicts, lexical conflicts, selected wording, and survival of the repaired phrase; repair a broken chain or return its exact defect rather than recording the successful chain as a pass account,
* classify FPF-governed trigger wording before acceptance by semantic area, not by a local forbidden-word list. Typical classes include admissibility/deontic terms, evidence and review-check terms, action-invitation terms, characteristic/scale and stratification source labels, state-family terms, lifecycle/process terms, pattern-application wording, publication-form terms, and local equivalents. The accepted sentence itself or its governing declaration must make the relevant object, value frame, relation, work, authority reference, pattern application, publication kind, companion function, or conformance claim recoverable; repair or report any case where it does not,
* generic heads and claim-bearing qualifiers are not accepted at face value in FPF-governed prose: restore the head kind first, and do not count a narrowing qualifier as that restoration; only then restore the qualifier claim kind or admissible-use boundary,
* if a sentence compares, escalates, downgrades, or otherwise puts pressure on a phrase after that restoration, check that the comparison criterion is ontologically homogeneous,
* when repaired wording still carries an architectural claim kind or admissible-use boundary, verify that the resulting primary `EntityOfConcern`, first useful move, outside work, and any role-word or package-form decision remain recoverable in the repaired text or the governing decision; repair or report a mismatch, and
* source-side old wording and continuity rules are respected.
**PCP‑DEONT (Deontic clause hygiene: RFC keywords)** — Trigger: the pattern conflates admissibility/validity constraints with deontic obligations (e.g., uses RFC keywords where a non-deontic Invariant: predicate is required).
Checks include:
* Deontic requirements are expressed with RFC-style keywords (see H-8);
* obligations are not smuggled into prose as informal imperatives. Admissibility/validity constraints are stated non‑deontically as `Invariant:` / `Well‑formedness constraint:` predicates and referenced from the Conformance Checklist when enforceable.
* **Subject discipline for RFC keywords.** If a sentence uses RFC keywords, its grammatical subject **MUST** be an agent or a specified published record/model whose required content is being constrained (author, reviewer, record, published model). RFC keywords **MUST NOT** modify modeled-world entities (e.g., “Earth”, “RoleAssignment”, “Role”, “holon”) — express those as `Invariant:` / `Well‑formedness constraint:` predicates instead, and (if needed) reference them from CC items.

**PCP-ENTRY (Pattern-entry discoverability and entry-orientation changes)** —
Trigger: one change substantively affects how one reader recognizes, selects,
rejects, or reclassifies one applicable governing pattern body, applicable projection function,
first-entry pattern-comparison set, Problem-frame recognition signature,
expanded entry-disambiguation case, or entry lexical-query cue.

Trigger classification:

`PCP-ENTRY` is an explicit profile identifier under the existing Pattern Check Profile family. It reuses the `PCP` profile kind; it is an editorial review profile, not a runtime gate, not `GateProfile`, not a workflow state, and not a new route registry.
PCP-ENTRY is risk-triggered rather than universal.
Use one lead review profile for the change, and import other profiles only for
their specific failure mode.

Use this risk-trigger model:

* **Trigger class 0 — micro-edit**
  punctuation, formatting, typo repair, grammar, or meaning-preserving
  compression with unchanged pattern-selection effect.
  No `PCP-ENTRY`, no compact pattern-local note, no evidence mode, and no parity scan
  are required.

* **Trigger class 1 — local recognition wording repair**
  one improved `Use this when`, `Not this pattern when`, or one removed
  sequence-implying phrase with unchanged candidate-pattern set and unchanged
  governing-entry or applicable-projection-function boundary.
  Only the four-question core check is required.

* **Trigger class 2 — substantive entry, companion, or projection change**
  one new or changed README scenario, ToC query cue, `E.11` entry-distribution locus, `I.2` expanded entry-disambiguation case, pattern, or applicable projection function
  newly treated as entry-bearing, one changed wrong-pattern or
  governing-entry or applicable-projection-function boundary, one changed local
  first-entry selection effect, or one substantive lexical-query cue change.
  The author leaves one compact pattern-local note, runs the core check, and adds at
  most one selected risk check if needed.

* **Trigger class 3 — multi-companion-function or high-risk public entry change**
  one change affecting several selected projection or companion functions together, one
  public-entry rewrite, one often-misclassified entry-recognition function, or one newly
  introduced first-entry pattern-comparison set.
  The author runs the core check and adds only the relevant selected risk
  check, usually parity, wrong-pattern, public-entry, or expanded-entry-disambiguation-case
  adequacy.

* **Trigger class 4 — retrieval-facing, observed-failure, or measured-improvement change**
  one retrieval-facing companion or projection function changes, one observed misretrieval or repeated
  search failure is being repaired, or the patch itself claims measured
  discoverability improvement.
  One selected evidence mode may be required, but benchmark-style reporting is
  not the default.

* **Trigger class 5 — normative authority, kind, or durable-name change**
  one entry-selection split, stable-name settlement, label-family change, or other
  normative architectural rewrite is in scope.
  `DRR`, `PCP-TERM`, and `PCP-MOD` are the lead decision or review profiles as applicable;
  `PCP-ENTRY` reviews only the entry-facing effects.

Ordinary non-triggers include:

* punctuation, formatting, and typo fixes;
* meaning-preserving prose tightening;
* one bare mention of a pattern without changed entry-selection effect;

* local wording repair that preserves the current first honest entry-recognition function,
  candidate-pattern set, governing-entry or applicable-projection-function boundary,
  and first-entry pattern-comparison-set membership.

`PCP-ENTRY` stays one narrow additive review profile, not one super-profile
that absorbs `PCP-PRAG`, `PCP-MOD`, `PCP-TERM`, `PCP-NORM`, and every other
review/check scope.
It composes with `PCP-PRAG`, `PCP-TERM`, and `PCP-MOD`; it does not replace
them.
Its distinctive object is changed pattern-selection effect, changed first-use
entry-recognition function, changed first-entry pattern-comparison-set membership, changed tempting-wrong-pattern
boundary, changed Problem-frame recognition function, changed expanded entry-disambiguation case
effect, changed entry lexical-query cue, and changed semantic companion-or-projection function parity.

Its default review scope is one small core triggered check:

1. **No workflow implication**
   Entry text does not imply mandatory sequence, control transfer, handoff, or
   publication, carrier, or record sequence unless another governing entry or applicable projection function
   explicitly governs that semantics.

2. **Governing-entry boundary preserved**
   Entry, index, and lexical-query companion functions do not redefine the governing pattern body's `Problem`
   or `Solution`.

3. **First honest entry-recognition function preserved**
   The change does not make the first entry-recognition function or case signal misleading.

4. **No duplicate high-detail companion or projection function**
   The change does not create one new stale echo or one second high-detail
   companion or projection function outside the one applicable governing pattern body or applicable projection function already
   named for the claim.

A change pays only the review cost of the concern it actually changes.
Learning-order edits do not trigger `PCP-ENTRY` unless they also change
candidate-pattern set, governing-entry or applicable-projection-function boundary,
first honest entry-recognition function, or first-entry pattern-comparison-set membership.
Lexical-only edits do not trigger extra entry-review scope unless they change
pattern-selection effect or entry recognition.
Retrieval fixtures are not required unless retrieval-facing behavior is
explicitly claimed, one machine-consumed projection is in scope, or one
observed misretrieval is being repaired.

When the risk warrants more than that core check, the run may add only the
relevant selected risk checks:

* one parity check when more than one pattern-entry
  discoverability-bearing projection changes;
* one wrong-pattern check when known misclassification is present;
* one lexical check when subject-language divergence is substantive;
* one expanded-entry-disambiguation-case check when `I.2` changes or one high-risk
  first-entry pattern-comparison set still lacks depth;
* one public-entry check when coarse public entry wording substantively changes
  entry-selection effect or carries high public-entry risk;
* one retrieval check when the change is retrieval-facing or repairs one
  observed retrieval failure.

Substantial discoverability changes leave one compact pattern-local note only when the governing discoverability decision needs that rationale; use the current `DRR`, `PCP` result, patch note, or other governing decision result rather than an E.19 progress record.
That pattern-local note may stop at one explicit rationale when the risk is already
controlled by governing-entry or applicable-projection-function inspection, companion-or-projection function
partition, or one local wording repair.
It is not a separate review record unless the change is high-risk, disputed,
public-facing with substantive entry risk, or retrieval-facing.

When one compact pattern-local note is needed, it names only the changed companion or projection function, the
affected first-entry pattern-comparison set or pattern, the changed first-use entry-recognition function or
recognition signature, the governing entry or applicable projection function for the
claim or projection function, and the selected check if any.

One compact risk-triggered gate is enough here:

| Change shape | Default check | Acceptance signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| typo, grammar, formatting, meaning-preserving compression | no evidence run beyond ordinary review | current entry-recognition function, governing-entry or applicable-projection-function boundary, and companion or projection function remains unchanged |
| one Problem-frame recognition-signature wording change or one wrong-pattern clarification | reviewer-only entry check | no workflow implication and no governing-entry or applicable-projection-function drift |
| one README scenario, ToC query cue, `E.11` entry-distribution locus, `I.2` expanded entry-disambiguation case, or changed candidate-pattern set | pattern-selection or wrong-pattern check | intended applicable governing pattern body or one admissible candidate-pattern set is recoverable without one false mandatory sequence |
| one lexical-hook change | lexical query check | subject-domain phrasing recovers the governing entry or applicable projection function without uncontrolled alias drift |
| two or more projection or companion functions change together | companion-or-projection function parity check | one governing entry or applicable projection function stays unique and the changed companion or projection functions agree on first-use entry-recognition function, wrong-pattern boundary, projection-only status, and no claim beyond the Core pattern body's admitted use; they need not share identical wording or examples |
| one high-risk public-facing or substantively changed first-entry companion or projection function changes | cold-reader recognition task | one reader can recover the intended applicable governing pattern body or admissible candidate-pattern set under the named first honest entry-recognition function |
| one retrieval-facing companion or projection function changes or one observed misretrieval is repaired | retrieval or `RAG` fixture | retrieval returns the governing entry or intended projection cue before one stale echo, and answer-to-governing-entry faithfulness remains intact |

Empirical evidence is required only when the change is:

* high-risk;
* disputed;
* retrieval-facing;
* repeatedly misclassified;
* public-facing with substantive entry-selection change, repeated failure, or one
  measured-improvement claim;
* or itself claims measured discoverability improvement.

`PCP-ENTRY-E4` is selected only when retrieval-facing behavior is explicitly
claimed, one machine-consumed projection is in scope, or one observed
misretrieval is being repaired.
Public-facing changes with substantive entry-selection risk usually select `PCP-ENTRY-E1`.
Lexical-hook changes usually select `PCP-ENTRY-E3`.
Changes across multiple projections or companion functions usually select `PCP-ENTRY-E5`.
Observed search or query failures usually select `PCP-ENTRY-E6`, optionally
together with `PCP-ENTRY-E3` or `PCP-ENTRY-E4` when the failure is lexical or
retrieval-facing.

The following evidence modes are selected high-risk tools, not one suite to
exhaust on ordinary authoring passes.
Selected evidence modes may include:

1. **PCP-ENTRY-E1 — cold-reader recognition or pattern-selection task**
   Given one real case signal, can one reader recover the intended applicable
   governing pattern body or one admissible candidate-pattern set?
   One tiny micro-task is enough:

   ```text
   Given this entry-recognition phrase, name:
   1. the first candidate pattern,
   2. one tempting wrong pattern,
   3. the admissible entry stop,
   4. the governing entry or applicable projection function.
   ```

2. **PCP-ENTRY-E2 — wrong-pattern and wrong-entry trap**
   Does the companion or projection function actively prevent the most tempting wrong pattern or wrong
   family?

3. **PCP-ENTRY-E3 — lexical query check**
   Does subject-domain phrasing retrieve the governing entry or applicable
   projection function without uncontrolled aliases?

4. **PCP-ENTRY-E4 — retrieval or `RAG` fixture**
   Does retrieval recover the governing entry or applicable projection function under
   exact-ID or keyword phrasing, under semantic paraphrase phrasing, and under
   projection-vs-governing-entry ambiguity, while keeping retrieved companion material,
   source faithfulness, stale echoes, and post-rationalized citation-like material distinct
   from the applicable governing pattern body?

5. **PCP-ENTRY-E5 — companion-or-projection function parity check**
   Do the companion or projection functions, plus any explicit absence note, preserve
   the same first-use entry-recognition function, governing entry or applicable projection function,
   wrong-pattern boundary, projection-only status, and no-claim-beyond-Core
   claim without requiring identical wording, rows, or examples?

6. **PCP-ENTRY-E6 — observed failure or query-log capture**
   Does one observed misretrieval, wrong-pattern loop, or repeated query miss
   still survive after the repair, or has the failure actually been
   removed?

#### E.19:4.3.1 - Tiny golden case bank for regression and worked examples

One tiny golden case bank is enough here. It is a review-regression echo, not the canonical entry inventory: rows 1-4 mirror README scenarios, `E.11` entry-distribution loci, and `I.2` expanded entry-disambiguation cases that already carry entry companion or projection functions, while rows 5-6 add review-specific search and retrieval stress cases. `E.11` and `I.2` remain the governing entry companions; this bank only tests whether a change preserved them.
It is not one benchmark suite and does not require universal empirical review for ordinary wording or companion-or-projection function edits.
A run may cite one relevant golden case or state that none is relevant. It does
not need to execute the whole bank.
It keeps a stable set of recurring entry-recognition functions recoverable across hardening
passes:

| Case | case_signal | expected_first_entry_pattern_comparison_set | candidate_patterns | tempting_wrong_pattern_or_wrong_relation | admissible_entry_stop | companion_or_projection_functions_that_help | projections_that_do_not_define_semantics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | “we need a shortlist, not one winner” | comparison / pool / selected-set publication pattern-comparison set | `A.19.CN`, `A.17-A.19`, `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.0`, and `G.5` when selected-set publication is claimed | treating `C.11` as one one-off choice when the real entry-recognition function is selected-set publication or candidate-set stabilization | admissible candidate-pattern set stabilised or selected-set publication opened | README scenario or `E.11` entry-distribution cue, one pattern `Problem frame`, one expanded entry-disambiguation case if compact cues still fail | one README blurb, one thin echo, one lexical-query row alone |
| 2 | “we have a vague cue, not yet a claim” | pre-articulation cue pattern-comparison set | `C.2.LS`, `A.16`, `A.16.1`, `B.4.1`, `B.5.2.0` | forcing the cue into one endpoint-claim, quality, or assurance pattern too early | `entry-recognition-reclassified` or cue preserved for the admissible next entry-recognition function | README scenario or `E.11` entry-distribution cue, one pattern `Problem frame`, one case-linked `I.2` expanded entry-disambiguation case when needed | one coarse public entry projection alone |
| 3 | “this is the same EntityOfConcern re-expressed for another audience” | same-EntityOfConcern rewrite pattern-comparison set | `A.6.3.CR`, `A.6.3.RT`, `E.17.EFP`, `E.17.ID.CR` | minting one second `U.Episteme` for the same claim or one second competing explanatory lane instead of one same-EntityOfConcern rewrite | `wrong-pattern-rejected` or same-EntityOfConcern rewrite opened | one expanded entry-disambiguation case, one pattern `Problem frame`, governing-entry pointer | one parallel explanatory blurb treated as one second governing pattern |
| 4 | “the API says X” | boundary-claim unpacking pattern-comparison set | `A.6`, `A.6.B`, `A.6.C`, `A.6.P`, `C.16.Q`, `A.6.A`, `E.17` | treating one boundary phrase as one agent duty, promise, quality verdict, or generic agreement paragraph without atomic claim assignment or quality-term repair with recovered characteristic and scale | `boundary-claim-pattern-opened`, `quality-term-repair-exited`, or atomic claim set opened | one boundary-focused `E.11` entry-distribution cue, one pattern `Problem frame`, one expanded entry-disambiguation case where interface/access/confused-quality wording is common | one query cue or public entry projection treated as the governing entry |
| 5 | “I found a pattern by search, but I am not sure it is the right one” | one pattern-local recognition-signature case under the selected pattern-comparison set | one candidate applicable governing pattern body plus one case-near governing pattern when needed | one lexical near-match or same-family pattern without governing-entry fit | `non-use-confirmed` or `pattern-selected` | one pattern `Problem frame`, one `E.11` entry-distribution cue, one lexical-query hook | one search-query row alone |
| 6 | “the LLM retrieved a helpful-looking paragraph but not the pattern” | one retrieval-facing first-entry pattern-comparison case | one applicable governing pattern body plus one applicable projection function | one stale thin echo or one projection-only companion function answered as if it were the governing entry | `governing-entry-opened` or `expanded-entry-disambiguation-case-needed` | one governing-entry reference, one projection-only status marker, one retrieval-facing pointer to the applicable governing pattern body | one thin echo chunk without governing-entry reference or projection-only cue |

These six cases are enough to keep:

* entry-recognition consistency;
* wrong-pattern or wrong-entry rejection;
* admissible entry-stop honesty;
* lexical-query discipline;
* thin-echo retrieval hygiene;
* and governing-entry and projection separation recoverable as the amendment
  lands.

When one empirical or retrieval evidence run is actually selected, the run
makes recoverable only the fields needed by that run, such as:

```text
viewpoint_class
task_prompt_or_query
expected_governing_entry_or_admissible_candidate_set
near_miss_patterns_or_projection_functions_if_any
time_budget_if_relevant
success_criterion_if_relevant
success_or_failure_note
observed_failure_mode_if_any
rationale_or_repair_action
```

When retrieval evidence is selected, keep retrieval result, answer
faithfulness, and stale-echo result distinct without forcing benchmark-style
reporting on ordinary edits.
One minimal retrieval fixture checks exact ID or keyword retrieval, semantic
paraphrase retrieval, projection-vs-governing-entry disambiguation,
and, when thin echoes are used, thin-echo governing-entry reference presence.
Ordinary local guidance stays prose-only rather than minting one stable
governing-entry reference by default.

#### E.19:4.3.2 - Common hardening questions are triggered by review need

Open a common hardening question when the concern has FPF-governed use, is disputed, or is explicitly invoked by the reviewed pattern or subset. Inspect the relevant source and the reviewed loci. In inspect-repair-verify, repair any defect and verify the affected use; in independent findings, record the defect and repair direction. When the question reveals no defect, make no durable absence or pass recital.

Use these questions only for the selected entry-recognition function:

1. **Usability and working-reader fit.** Open this when first-reading recognition text, assurance text, first-minute working-reader usability, practical payoff, worked slices, primary-reader fit, or `E.8` / `E.12` / `E.13` / `E.14` / `E.17.*` / `F.16` checks can change the admission or refresh result. If a separate evaluation assigns a value, use that evaluation's result rather than copying it into E.19 findings.
2. **Scenario, anti-case, and utility-fit source set.** Open this when a scenario pack, anti-case corpus, pilot bank, utility tree, fitness catalog, or analogous source is actually relevant or substantively disputed. Record only a missing, misused, or failing source/case as an E.19 finding.
3. **Packaging, governing-pattern relation, package relation, and shipping fit.** Open this before a send-facing, landing-facing, monolith-facing, governing-pattern-relation, or package-relation claim. The changed sources and governing landing or release result carry successful alignment; E.19 repairs or reports a mismatch.
4. **Domain-tightened profile depth.** Open this when a domain-specific note actually tightens a selected profile. Apply its questions; do not add a second account of positive results.
5. **Accepted-decision or accepted-source-material carry-through.** Open this when the work claims to implement an accepted `DRR`, returned-finding set, intake, architecture source material, or other accepted source material named by value. Inspect each independently applicable decision against the reviewed loci or its named governing FPF pattern, companion document, result, or accepted source material. Repair or report partial, missing, wrongly rejected, or wrongly routed carry-through. The accepted source remains the decision source; E.19 does not duplicate decisions that are expressed sufficiently, inherited unchanged, correctly absent, or outside the reviewed subset. Do not rename an `E.17.ID.CR` comparative review unit, `PublicationUnit`, publication form or face, source-pinned interpretation case, source material, or project-side review relation as an `E.19` reviewed pattern or subset.

For `PCP-ENTRY`, the ordinary compact pattern-local change note remains enough when the governed discoverability decision requires one; no separate E.19 account is created merely because the profile was checked.

#### E.19:4.3.3 - Pattern-Edition Use-Value Replay

Use this replay when an exact candidate pattern edition changes materially under `E.8:4.1.2`. Run it on the stable candidate before acceptance or landing, not after each edit. First verify the author-selected branch against the exact edition basis and changed locus. Treat a change as mechanical only when the smallest relevant comparison shows that every materiality value named in `E.8:4.1.2` is preserved. A genuinely bounded local semantic edit opens only its affected use probe and changed wording group; physical rewrite size is not evidence.

Judge each selected use probe separately when its result can differ by branch, exact edition or candidate-only basis, working use or relying work, expected first useful result, boundary, necessity, or evidence mode. One review may contain probes from both branches. A grouped verdict such as `uses preserved or added` or `usability preserved` cannot substitute for those judgements. E.19 does not prescribe a per-probe progress store: inspect-repair-verify repairs and verifies failed probes, while independent findings records only regressions, insufficiencies, invalid transfers, unsupported decisions, and blockers. When `E.8`, `E.21`, or another governing evaluation requires reusable dispositions or values, keep them in that evaluation's result rather than copying them into E.19 findings.

**Changed-wording check inside each affected prior-edition probe.** Keep the selected use probe as the outer unit. When a predecessor-bearing candidate materially rewrites a normative sentence or inseparable sentence group that carries the governed extension, action discriminator, first useful result, stop, or neighboring-pattern exit, give that wording group its applicable differential disposition below before closing the outer probe. Keep sentences together only when they serve one reader task and must receive one disposition; split them when their extension, action, result, or route can differ.

For each changed wording group:

1. pin the old and candidate wording and the exact use it serves;
2. state in plain language the subject, concrete action or choice, visible result, and stop or exit;
3. compare the old head and modifiers, modal force, admitted referents/actions, excluded near-misses, and local interpretation burden;
4. probe the nearest alien case the candidate might newly admit and the nearest valid case it might newly exclude, naming any case that crosses the boundary; and
5. apply the differential disposition. `preserved` requires no unauthorized widening or narrowing and no greater decoding burden: a reader must not need campaign memory or an ontology-development memorandum to recover the action.

For a new action-guiding paragraph with no predecessor, do not invent history. Test one nearby alien case that must remain outside and verify that the local wording itself exposes a recognizable situation, concrete action or choice, visible first result, and non-use or neighboring-pattern exit.

Keep the cheap path cheap. Formatting, typo, link, citation, or exact-reference corrections remain mechanical when the smallest comparison proves that no `E.8:4.1.2` materiality value changed. A bounded semantic edit checks only its affected wording group and use probe. Reuse an earlier hunk or lexical result only when the object and compared editions, changed scope, and assurance question match this extension, modal-force, near-miss, and interpretation-burden test; idea presence or broad-use preservation is not enough. This is one same-increment stable-candidate pass before acceptance or landing, not per-keystroke review, a new ledger, or a one-finding handoff.

**Prior-edition differential.** For one candidate pattern edition × one prior-edition use probe, distinguish the applicable disposition when the governing decision needs it:

| Disposition | Semantic test and recoverability |
| --- | --- |
| `preserved` | The situation, action, result, and required boundary remain semantically available; every material changed wording group retains its head-and-modifier extension, modal force, admitted valid cases, excluded near-misses, and no-greater-decoding-burden condition. The declared use remains admissible and replayable from the pinned editions. |
| `improved` | The required old use and every required changed-wording boundary remain preserved, and a separate replay demonstrates an action, result, boundary, affordability, or interpretation-burden gain. |
| `transferred` | A discoverable handoff reaches one named neighboring pattern whose Solution carries the needed action guidance and exposes its result. A bare pattern ID or unreachable action is `regressed`. |
| `intentionally retired` | An accepted decision drops a harmful or false old action and supplies the corrected positive action or boundary as the recoverability endpoint. |
| `regressed` | A required action, result, risk disclosure, cheap exit, or usable handoff is absent; or changed wording admits an unauthorized alien case, excludes a valid case, changes modal force, or makes the reader decode more unstated ontology. Repair or an explicit retirement decision is required. |

A use classified as unsupported historical residue before replay receives no differential disposition and supports no compatibility claim. New evidence of a valid old use reopens that classification instead of restoring wording silently. A required `regressed` probe prevents a positive conclusion, but it does not stop inspection of the remaining independent probes.

**Candidate-only adequacy.** Review one candidate pattern edition × one new intended-use probe against its exact candidate-only basis, never against invented history. Distinguish these outcomes when the governing decision needs them:

| Outcome | Semantic test |
| --- | --- |
| **adequate for the candidate-only use** | The selected basis, recognizable situation, concrete action or choice, first useful result, action-changing boundary, intended reader, and one nearby alien case that stays outside are recoverable from the local candidate wording and executable enough for the declared use. |
| **absent or insufficient for the candidate-only use** | The use is only promised, named, over-broad, ambiguous, or unsupported; the intended reader cannot perform the action, distinguish the first result, reject the nearby alien case, or recognize the non-use/neighbor exit from the local wording. |

A missing candidate-only decision or basis is `absent or insufficient`; it never licenses a fabricated prior edition. Absence for a required new use prevents a positive conclusion but does not stop the other independent probes. Absence for optional breadth is non-blocking by itself but cannot support breadth, transfer, or exceptional-expression claims. If no exact new intended use is selected, no candidate-only check opens.

**Replay the positive Solution separately.** Judge the following over the candidate edition when their answers can differ:

1. the governed subject;
2. the recurring problem and ordinary failure;
3. an executable proposed move;
4. a first useful result rather than completed review apparatus;
5. each prominent boundary or guard and the credible neighboring case whose action it changes;
6. guards that inspect an already present positive Solution instead of supplying its outline; and
7. for a method-bearing Solution that prescribes actual work or world-side change, the intended reader, method episteme, admitted performing `U.System`, current role assignment under which that system performs the work, dated work, and problem-facing result as separately recoverable positions. Treat the item as defective if the episteme, checklist, reader role, plan, or prose performs the work; leave it not applicable when the pattern only guides a judgement.

Refine item 5 by boundary whenever boundaries can pass, fail, or route independently. Follow the short first-use rendering's action and result logic against a concrete situation. Merely finding words such as `situation`, `move`, `result`, or `stop` is not evidence. Repair each failed item or record it as an exact finding with remediation direction; do not replace the replay with one prose-quality impression.

**Replay each triggered enumeration.** Verify the semantic resolution selected under `E.8:4.1.2`: a declared closed set has one explicit membership rule covering every member; named-kind or proposition examples remain subordinate and explicitly non-exhaustive; heterogeneous neighbors do not assert a false common kind; an implicit kind, relation, or structure reaches an existing direct governor or remains blocked; and a hidden action or claim is stated before its examples. Review a member separately when its membership can fail independently or require a different repair. A genuinely small closed set may be judged together only when one rule yields one truthful conclusion for every member and no member can differ. Nearby nouns that assert no common membership, and an unchanged declared set or example list still covered by its exact rule, need no durable positive recital. A blanket `all lists are coherent` conclusion cannot replace review of a triggered enumeration.

Desk replay is the ordinary evidence mode for use branches, changed wording groups, new action-guiding paragraphs, the positive Solution, and enumerations. Escalate to a cold reader, AI agent, or observed-work exercise when competing actions remain plausible, a near-miss boundary or result distinction is not recoverable by inspection, a transfer is uncertain, or a missed failure has high consequence. When a claim extends recurring applicability beyond the exact cases, or high consequence makes one observed slice insufficient, select a proportionate qualitative practitioner survey, action-research cycle, or case study. Evidence escalation is risk-selected; it is not a universal benchmark or an ordinary-rewrite requirement. E.19 returns repairs or findings while leaving ordinal coordinate values and `PatternQualityStatus` to the full E.21 evaluation.

#### E.19:4.4 - Decision outcomes

Complete the selected review scope before making an admission, refresh, or return-for-repair conclusion. A first defect or already-negative conclusion does not end the search for other independently obtainable findings. If a condition makes the remaining questions impossible to judge truthfully or safely, name the unexamined scope and the condition instead of presenting a partial result as complete.

**Inspect, repair, and verify.** Repair every in-scope defect and run a focused verification over the affected questions. The repaired pattern or subset and the focused verification are the substantive result. Record only an unresolved blocker, a decision outside the current authority, or work that must transfer to another author; do not create a parallel list that retells completed repairs.

**Independent findings.** Leave one compact set of all actionable in-scope defects and blockers, ordered by semantic impact, with repair direction precise enough that the author need not rediscover the diagnosis. If the selected questions reveal no defect, do not create an empty pass report or a positive checklist recital.

If a governing admission, refresh, `E.21`, `DRR`, landing, or release decision requires a durable conclusion or value, use its existing result. That result may cite E.19 findings or the repaired candidate; it does not turn per-question positive outcomes into a second review record.

**Precision-remediation order.** When a defect sentence combines a generic head, a claim-bearing qualifier, and mixed comparison-criterion pressure, remediation SHOULD repair them in that order: restore head kind, then qualifier claim kind or admissible-use boundary, then comparison-criterion homogeneity. A narrowing qualifier does **not** by itself repair the head-kind defect. Only after those repairs may the review keep or reintroduce a Plain, didactic, or coarsened restatement, and only if the more precise upstream interpretation remains recoverable.

**Kind-restoration verification.** A wording, naming, or F.19 phrase-level repair does not succeed merely because the old trigger word disappeared. Recheck the pre-repair and post-repair kind, relation or claim kind, admissible use, and scope. If the repair narrows, widens, splits, or changes them without an accepted decision, repair it or keep the defect unresolved. The repaired object, focused verification, or governing decision carries this evidence; E.19 does not require a per-repair pass account.

**Ordering and effort.** Put ontology, semantics, modularity, and SoTA defects in FPF-governed sections before compact low-signal formatting findings. If semantic defects are present, address them before mechanical edits; formatting and micro-typos must not dominate the work by volume.

### E.19:5 - Archetypal Grounding — Tell–Show–Show: System / Episteme

| Scenario | U.System grounding | U.Episteme grounding |
|---|---|---|
| **Tell** | A safety-critical engineering team proposes a new pattern describing how to gate a subsystem before deployment. The draft looks polished, but it quietly imports domain terms, assumes cross-team equivalences, and introduces requirements that are not listed in the pattern checklist. | A research group refreshes an older pattern that summarizes how to evaluate evidence-sufficiency class. The pattern still appears clear, but its SoTA references and terminology no longer match current practice, and its Relations point to patterns that were renamed or superseded. |
| **Show (failure without PQG)** | Reviewers focus on whether the idea is good and whether the template exists. The pattern is admitted, but later users disagree on what it requires because the Conformance Checklist is incomplete and key constraints are only in prose. | The pattern remains unchanged because “nothing looks broken”. Over time, it becomes a conceptual fossil: newcomers treat it as current guidance, but it encodes an outdated stance and stale vocabulary. |
| **Show (repair with PQG profiles)** | PCP‑BASE finds missing internal coherence (requirements in prose not reflected in CC). PCP‑TERM finds naming drift and scope-smuggling in new terms. PCP‑BRIDGE finds implicit cross-context identity claims without explicit alignment. The same work repairs and rechecks all three defects before admission; the final CC becomes the canonical conformance body. | Independent review records the outdated SoTA‑Echoing, excess scope, and stale Relations as findings with repair direction. The author updates the Solution and evidence, limits historical material to historical lineage, repairs Relations, and returns the changed pattern for focused verification. |

### E.19:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Universal** (applies to all patterns and all clusters).

Bias risks and mitigations:

* **Governance bias (Gov):** reviewers may over-prioritize compliance signals and under-prioritize teaching value.
  *Mitigation:* PCP‑BASE includes didactic grounding and internal coherence checks and priority for ontology and semantics, not to form.
* **Epistemic monoculture (Onto/Epist):** SoTA‑Echoing can become single-tradition name-dropping.
  *Mitigation:* require explicit multi-tradition coverage and usage of F.18 for neutral naming.
* **Pragmatic bias (Prag):** a pattern can be “correct” yet unusable.
  *Mitigation:* consequences and anti-patterns remain mandatory sections, surfacing trade-offs and misuse paths.
* **Didactic bias (Did):** narrative quality can be mistaken for truth.
  *Mitigation:* conformance and SoTA‑Echoing sections bind claims to explicit requirements and lineage.

### E.19:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC-E19-1 (Baseline triage is mandatory).** | Every PQG review **MUST** apply **PCP-BASE** to the reviewed pattern or subset. When the complete baseline finds no risk requiring a risk-selected profile, the review may finish after any small mechanical defect is repaired and verified or returned as an independent finding. This is only an `E.19` review boundary; it cannot support an `E.21` coordinate value, `PatternQualityStatus`, all-`4`/all-`5` claim, landing-quality claim, or improvement-movement claim without the complete governing `E.21` result. | Ensures one shared triage floor without turning every review into a full audit or substitute quality measurement. |
| **CC-E19-2 (Profile selection covers the live risks).** | The review scope **MUST** name PCP-BASE, every risk-selected PCP, the risk selecting each additional profile, and any override. It **MUST** consider the whole current profile set rather than only the easiest visible family. When an override affects a later admission, refresh, or other governing decision, its false-positive reason and compensating check belong in that decision basis; successful profile choices need no per-profile pass entries. | Makes review depth repeatable without a separate record of successful checks. |
| **CC-E19-3 (Delta-Class & impact for breaking change levels).** | If the reviewed change is **Δ-2/Δ-3** per E.15, the governing change or decision result **MUST** carry Delta-Class, impact radius, a DRR pointer, and the required refresh and Bridge consequences. E.19 repairs or reports a missing or false account; it does not duplicate a successful one. | Keeps evolution controlled while leaving change evidence with the change decision. |
| **CC-E19-4 (Conformance-claim coherence is enforced).** | Inspect-repair-verify **MUST** eliminate orphan and unclaimed requirements by aligning the reviewed pattern's Conformance Checklist, deontic clauses, admissibility constraints, and Solution. Independent findings **MUST** identify each surviving incoherence and give concrete repair direction. | Preserves the CC as the enforceable conformance check set in both review forms. |
| **CC-E19-5 (Triage & noise discipline).** | The run **SHOULD** prioritize FPF-governed sections and deontic requirements (e.g. CC, content of deontic clauses and content of admissibility constraints, definitions, Relations, SoTA, modularity) and keep purely mechanical edits (e.g. RFC-form deontic cleanup) minimal. Template defects **MUST** be fixed before admission (or before closing a refresh run) but **MUST NOT** be used to skip semantic review. | Improves semantic trust without turning review into form-only compliance. |
| **CC-E19-6 (Review form and findings completeness).** | The review **MUST** choose one form from E.19:4.1 and inspect every independently answerable in-scope question even after the first defect, blocker, or negative conclusion. Inspect-repair-verify ends with every in-scope defect repaired and focused verification performed; independent review ends with one complete set of actionable defects and blockers plus concrete repair direction. A question that reveals no defect gets no durable pass entry. Early stop is allowed only when the remaining questions cannot be judged truthfully or safely, and then the unexamined scope and cause **MUST** be named. | Prevents both first-defect stopping and a third, report-producing review form. |
| **CC-E19-7 (Recognition text, assurance text, and self-containment).** | Admission or refresh runs for new and substantially revised patterns **MUST** check that a first-reading recognition text appears early enough for the intended reader, that the heavier assurance text remains visibly second rather than becoming the first real point of entry, and that the assurance text does not silently shift the recognition-text claim. The run **MUST** check for a recognisable working situation, what goes wrong if the pattern is missed, what the pattern buys, the first admissible action-guiding move the user should take, and an ordinary `not this pattern when` boundary; for any FPF-governed typed declaration or modeling lens, the run **MUST** confirm that a short user-facing statement exposes the primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, or claim record and the minimal lens that keeps it reviewable; the run **MUST** also check that the primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, or claim record keeps one stable kind across title, opening function, declaration function, worked slices, and related-pattern or companion guidance named by value rather than drifting between the named primary `EntityOfConcern`, an act, a work-result record, and carrier-placement labels. When a broader umbrella name and a narrower operative branch are both used, the run **MUST** check that the recognition text makes that stack explicit enough to identify the umbrella, the active branch, the primary `EntityOfConcern`, the move, and the wider work or process that still remains outside. The recognition text **MUST** start from a recognisable problem-owning domain or practice moment whenever that can be done without loss of precision, rather than opening first with internal package architecture or taxonomy language. Early FPF-governed technical terms **MUST** receive nearby pairwise plain glosses; transform-like families **MUST** carry concrete worked slices plus ordinary-vs-FPF-governed wording guidance where needed; and any `SoTA-Echoing` used as explanatory grounding **MUST** state a short practitioner or manager implication plus visible linkage to the worked cases or boundary slices it disciplines. If SoTA or practice tradition has FPF-governed use, the run **MUST** check that primary-EntityOfConcern choice, narrowed-branch choice, and practical payoff remain answerable to the relevant domain or practice rather than only to internal package architecture. If a pattern claims universal or transdisciplinary usefulness, the run **MUST** check that this breadth is already demonstrated in the recognition text through at least three heterogeneous situations, with `F.16` preferred as the example-matrix template. | Prevents architecturally correct but reader-opaque patterns and keeps broad claims from appearing only late in the assurance text. |
| **CC-E19-7a (Epistemic precision cleanup cannot leave inert recognition).** | If admission or refresh includes `E.10`-triggered epistemic precision restoration, check that recognition remains useful under `E.2` P-2 and `E.12`: the intended reader can still recover why the distinction matters, the remaining admissible use, or the FPF pattern application and governing ontology that carry the claim. Check that Plain or didactic wording either remains ordinary or maps back to the repaired Tech reading under `E.10:6.2`, and preserve intentional metaphors that satisfy that boundary. In inspect-repair-verify, restore any harmed working situation or first useful move; in independent review, record the exact harm. Positive improved/preserved recitals belong only to a separate governing evaluation that requires them. | Prevents type-correct cleanup from destroying practical guidance without imposing positive review accounts. |
| **CC-E19-8 (Sentence-level precision restoration).** | Review FPF-governed sentences for generic heads, claim-bearing qualifiers, overloaded trigger words, bare relation shorthand, hidden slots or relation positions, use-relation or claim-kind shorthand, and hidden process/API metaphors. An `E.10` scan closes only not-triggered and local lexical cases; episteme/publication/source-use cases open `C.2.P`, and state-family cases open `A.19.SPR` or their already-recovered governor. Restore head kind before qualifier claim kind or admissible-use boundary, then any live slot, relation position, use relation, claim kind, and comparison-criterion homogeneity. Verify pre/post kind, relation, admissible use, and scope; broad umbrella wording must expose the umbrella, active branch, primary `EntityOfConcern`, first useful move, and outside work when those distinctions carry the claim. Naming repair follows the `F.18 -> A.6.P` chain. Inspect-repair-verify leaves the repaired wording and focused check; independent review records only a broken chain, failed restoration, or blocker. | Keeps controlled technical writing from collapsing into free shorthand without demanding a positive phrase-by-phrase account. |
| **CC-E19-9 (Package-form, governing-pattern relation, and package-relation function-word discipline).** | Check that `primary carrier`, `specialization`, `profile`, `overlay`, `family`, `bundle`, `cluster`, `suite`, `pack`, `kit`, `record`, `umbrella`, and local equivalents match the actual ontology rather than drifting by style. If a repair introduces or retains a head already occupied elsewhere in FPF, verify intentional reuse or repair/report the collision. | Keeps governing-pattern relations, package relations, review functions, and package forms legible without recording successful collision checks. |
| **CC-E19-10 (Reader-fit discipline).** | Check every pattern host or monolith section for the intended FPF user, an explicit primary reader/concern/viewpoint when several readers are served, and separation of user guidance from package-development, review, evaluation, projection, landing, or release reasoning about the same pattern version. Part E patterns may govern authoring or review as their declared subject matter, but that does not admit development correspondence about the current version. Repair each leak or return its exact locus as a finding; sections with no leak need no scan recital. | Keeps reviews from accepting conceptually correct but reader-confused patterns. |
| **CC-E19-10a (Quality/projection carrier leakage).** | Check whether pattern prose, including Relations, Rationale, SoTA-Echoing, worked slices, examples, tables, and the Conformance Checklist, contains corpus projection, retrieval/cold-reader evidence, monolith parity, landing evidence, `PatternQualityStatus`, all-`4`/all-`5` posture, or development correspondence about that pattern version. This is a sentence-function check, not a lexical search. Return such material to its `E.21`, E.19 findings, README/ToC/E.11/I.2, projection, release, or landing result and retain only the pattern's admissible user-facing move or boundary. | Prevents quality and projection proof from becoming pattern prose. |
| **CC-E19-11 (Precision before relaxation).** | If remediation preserves or introduces a Plain, didactic, or coarsened restatement of a repaired FPF-governed sentence, the run **MUST** keep a more precise upstream interpretation recoverable and must not let the softened form become the only wording with authority-reference claim kind or admissible-use boundary. | Keeps later readability aids subordinate to an explicit more precise interpretation. |
| **CC-E19-12 (Integration impact is checked).** | Before send or monolith-facing motion for a new or substantially revised subset, inspect related governing patterns and constraints, companion notes, Relations entries, and monolith sections. Repair each in-scope mismatch or return it as a finding and name any genuinely outside boundary. Successful synchronization remains in the changed sources and governing landing or release result. | Prevents an isolated local improvement without duplicating synchronization evidence. |
| **CC-E19-13 (Usability and proxy-to-value are checked).** | For a new or substantially revised subset, check recognition versus assurance text, first-minute situation, practical payoff, ordinary boundary, worked slices, primary reader/viewpoint, and the applicable `E.8`, `E.12`, `E.13`, `E.14`, `E.17.*`, `F.16`, or local-equivalent questions. Repair or report a usability defect. If a score, coordinate, benchmark, projection signal, or all-`5` posture is used as value evidence, the governing `E.13` result—not an E.19 pass account—must carry intended value, proxy use, gains, losses, minimally viable value slice, and reopen condition. | Prevents visible review success from replacing practical value. |
| **CC-E19-14 (Scenario, anti-case, and utility fit are checked when applicable).** | When the domain has a relevant scenario pack, anti-case corpus, pilot bank, utility tree, fitness catalog, or analogous common source, use its applicable cases and qualities. Repair a failing case or return the exact failure, missing source, or out-of-scope boundary as a finding; do not record cases that revealed no defect merely to prove consultation. | Keeps common validation sources active without a separate consultation record. |
| **CC-E19-15 (Packaging, governing-pattern relation, package relation, and shipping fit are checked).** | Before a send-, landing-, or monolith-facing claim, inspect the relevant package form, governing-pattern relation, package relation, publication function and authority reference, and the actual send, landing, and monolith facts. Repair or report any mismatch. The governing release or landing result carries the successful state claim; E.19 does not repeat it. | Keeps shipping claims truthful without a second state account. |
| **CC-E19-16 (Domain-tightened profile depth is applied).** | When a domain-specific depth note such as semio `FIT-*` applies, use it to tighten the selected PCP questions. Repair or report any defect it reveals; do not add positive or not-found recitals to an E.19 result. | Keeps domain-specific depth operative rather than optional folklore or extra reporting. |
| **CC-E19-17 (Companion-material retention is justified).** | When a new or refreshed pattern subset keeps a long-lived companion, profile, check sheet, pattern-local companion row, review harness, or analogous selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair, the result **MUST** make its companion function explicit: companion use question, governing pattern or selected non-pattern FPF kind-reference pair, admissible companion-only use, one real breakage if absent, and retention, accepted-source-material-only, or removal condition when no such breakage exists. | Prevents companion material from remaining by inertia or becoming hidden authority after the pattern body already carries the usable guidance. |
| **CC-E19-18 (Substantive solution and locus adequacy is checked).** | A new, refreshed, or materially repaired subset **MUST** receive a pattern-specific substantive adequacy check unless the change is purely mechanical. Check whether it still solves the stated problem, assigns claims to the correct governing loci, preserves kind boundaries and selected companion/projection functions, keeps SoTA grounding current enough, remains usable without excess apparatus, and worsens no content relation. Repair each in-scope failure or return it as a finding and name any needed wider boundary. Questions that reveal no defect need no separate account. | Prevents clean checklists and terminology from hiding wrong content. |
| **CC-E19-19 (Accepted-decision carry-through is checked).** | When the work claims to implement an accepted `DRR`, returned findings, intake, architecture source material, or other accepted source named by value, inspect each applicable decision against the reviewed loci or its named governing pattern, companion, result, or source. Repair or report partial, missing, wrongly rejected, or wrongly routed carry-through. The accepted source remains the decision source; do not duplicate decisions expressed sufficiently, inherited unchanged, correctly absent, or outside the subset. Keep `E.17.ID.CR` units, `PublicationUnit`, publication forms/faces, source materials, and project-side review relations in their governing kinds. | Prevents accepted decisions from disappearing without making E.19 their second authority. |
| **CC-E19-20 (Pattern-quality review is not project certification).** | If an `E.19` result is reused outside FPF pattern-quality review, the project-side governing result **MUST** name the project-side claim, relation, and required evidence or assurance. `E.19` alone **MUST NOT** be treated as project evidence, gate input, release justification, compliance or safety assurance, work authority, or publication truth. E.19 repairs or reports misuse; it does not create a duplicate project-side account. | Prevents pattern review from supplying false project-world certification. |
| **CC-E19-21 (Precision-restoration distribution is preserved).** | When the reviewed change applies or edits `E.10`-triggered precision restoration, the run **MUST** check that the selected precision-restoration architecture remains distributed: `E.10` states trigger and applicability, `E.10.ARCH` states shared recovery architecture, realization patterns perform ontological unpacking for the EntityOfConcern, relation, claim, characteristic-space item, state-family field, or other selected ontological neighborhood named by value, and affected patterns carry only thin pointers named by value unless they themselves work over the recovered primary entity, relation, claim, characteristic-space item, state-like field, or phrase or record named by value. A review fails this row when an affected pattern silently grows a second trigger registry, a duplicate recovery algorithm, or a local architecture that contradicts the selected restoration pattern. | Prevents pattern admission or refresh from re-centralizing wording-use restoration or duplicating `E.10.ARCH` inside affected patterns. |
| **CC-E19-22 (EntityOfConcern and precision-restoration triage is applied).** | When a change touches EntityOfConcern wording, source aliases, same-referent preservation, slot/reference migration, alignment paths, role/method/work boundaries, description/publication-use guards, semio-bias repair, phrase apparatus, architecture or package rationale, quality/projection evidence, or repeated boundary doctrine, recover the pattern's own `EntityOfConcern`, first useful move, positive subject-kind/action spine, source-wording and retargeting result, alignment path, ordinary references, and governing patterns for outside claims. Use the active evaluation's own result—`E.21` `PrecisionRestorationProfile` when active—and repair or report each mismatch. A grouped “E.10/E.19 passed” statement cannot replace these questions, while successful questions need no E.19 recital. | Keeps precision restoration auxiliary to the pattern claim without a second evaluation record. |
| **CC-E19-23 (Pattern-edition use-value replay preserves distinct outcomes).** | When `E.8:4.1.2` selects a material edition change, judge separately every selected use probe whose branch, basis, working use, expected result, boundary, necessity, evidence, or repair can differ. Inside each affected prior-edition probe, give every materially changed normative sentence or inseparable reader-task group its applicable differential disposition after comparing head/modifiers, modal force, admitted and excluded cases, nearest alien/valid boundary cases, and interpretation burden. A new action-guiding paragraph supplies a local situation, action, result, non-use/neighbor exit, and nearby alien case without invented history. Replay the positive Solution and independently contestable enumeration members, continue after failures, and reuse prior results only when object/versions, scope, and assurance question match this exact test. Run this once on the stable candidate before acceptance or landing; do not create per-keystroke review, a second ledger, or positive recitals. | Prevents broad-use preservation from hiding sentence-level extension drift or ontology-bureaucratese while keeping bounded edits cheap. |

### E.19:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Why it fails | How to avoid / repair |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary-EntityOfConcern drift** | The draft appears to govern one thing in the opening, another in the declaration block, and a third in the examples or related-pattern or companion guidance named by value. | Review cannot tell whether the pattern governs a `PublicationUnit`, an interpretive move, a work-result record, or a whole process, so later naming and boundary decisions become unstable. | Stabilise one primary `EntityOfConcern` early, keep its head kind explicit, and mark note, sheet, UI, rendering, or process labels as either examples of that object or separate related entities rather than stylistic substitutes. |
| **Reader-fit clean but pragmatically foggy** | The draft is addressed to the right reader in principle, but cold working readers still cannot recognise the situation, practical payoff, primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation named by value, claim record, or first useful move early enough. | The run passes reader-fit hygiene while still failing pragmatic fit and first-minute usability. | Pull a recognisable working situation upward, add one minimally viable worked case, make the practical payoff explicit in nearby user-facing prose, expose the primary `EntityOfConcern` and any minimal modeling lens in plain terms, add plain glosses for early claim-bearing terms, and require `SoTA-Echoing` rows that carry claim kind, admissible-use boundary, or explanatory work to name the practitioner or manager implication plus the case they discipline. |
| **Architecture-clean but domain-thin** | The text is internally well placed in the package, but the primary `EntityOfConcern`, narrowed branch, or practical payoff are justified mainly through package architecture while the problem-owning domain, practice, or SoTA appears late or decoratively. | The pattern passes internal architecture checks while drifting away from the domain whose work it claims to improve. | Pull the problem-owning domain moment into the recognition text, make the narrowed branch and primary `EntityOfConcern` answerable to the relevant domain or practice, and require FPF-governed `SoTA-Echoing` to discipline the practical cases rather than merely bless them after the fact. |
| **Type-correct but inert epistemic precision cleanup** | An `E.10`-triggered epistemic precision restoration removes the overread and restores kind language, but the recognition text no longer tells the reader why the distinction matters, what reader use remains, which FPF pattern application now carries the claim, or how a Plain recognition line maps back to the recovered Tech reading when both registers are used. | The review accepts typed wording while losing action guidance. | Return the draft to same-boundary repair: restore a remaining admissible reader use, name the FPF pattern application and governing ontology, repair the Tech-to-Plain mapping, or demote the phrase to reduced-use cue, quote-only wording, blocked transfer, or rewrite incomplete. |
| **Expressive overread rebound after epistemic precision cleanup** | The pass makes the text more engaging after cleanup, but the added Plain or didactic wording carries ontological, evidence, causal, assurance, bridge, gate, work, decision, or admissibility claim kind or admissible-use boundary not recoverable from the Tech reading or named FPF pattern application. | The review mistakes readability for recovered semantic work. | Rewrite the expressive line as ordinary recognition aid, recover its claim kind or admissible-use boundary through the Tech fields under `E.10:6.2`, name the FPF pattern application and governing ontology that carries the claim, or demote the phrase to reduced-use cue, quote-only wording, blocked transfer, or rewrite incomplete. |
| **Verdict-only review** | Independent review ends with pass/fail or prose complaints but no complete actionable finding set, or repair-mode review reports defects without repairing and rechecking them. | Leaves later work to rediscover diagnosis or mistakes an intention to repair for a completed repair. | In independent review, record every actionable in-scope defect and blocker with precise direction; in inspect-repair-verify, repair and verify them. Questions with no defect get no durable pass recital. |
| **Single giant checklist** | Review becomes a long, unfocused ritual that few complete. | Increases cost; reduces fit and rigor in practice. | Use a minimal baseline plus risk-selected profiles; use `E.21` only when a pattern-version quality value is being evaluated. |
| **Template-only compliance** | All headings exist, but requirements are vague and untestable. | Looks uniform; fails enforceability and auditability. | Enforce normative clause hygiene and CC/Solution coherence. |
| **SoTA name-dropping** | SoTA-Echoing is a list of buzzwords with no stance. | Breaks evidence lineage; invites monoculture. | Require adopt/adapt/reject with reasons per item. |
| **Terminology drift by “synonym”** | Authors swap kernel terms for nicer-sounding words. | Increases ambiguity; harms cross-pattern composability. | Apply PCP-TERM and require explicit mini-definitions on first use. |
| **Lexical substitution accepted as repair** | The reviewed text no longer contains the trigger word, but the replacement changes the FPF kind, relation, current ontic slot, relation position, use relation, or claim kind, admissible use, or scope. | The review rewards surface cleanup while ontology drift remains or gets worse. | Require a `KindRestorationCheck`; if pre/post kinds or slots, relation positions, use relations, or claim kinds do not match or an accepted split/change decision is absent, keep the finding blocking. |
| **Form-only review** | Review time goes to formatting and micro-edits while the normative content, terms, Bridges, modularity, slot discipline and SoTA stance are barely checked. | Raises editorial cost without raising semantic trust. | Use the triage rule: treat FPF-governed sections as depth loci and keep mechanical cleanup subordinate to semantic correction. |
| **Checklist-clean but content-wrong** | The named profiles, lexical checks, and conformance rows are marked complete, but the repaired text no longer solves the stated problem, assigns a claim to the wrong locus, creates shadow authority, loses a selected companion or projection function, or adds needless boilerplate or support material. | Review accepts a locally tidy pattern while weakening the actual `FPF` guidance. | Apply substantive solution and locus adequacy: name local content questions, check the actual problem and governing loci named by value, ask what became worse, and widen the declared boundary by value when the fix belongs outside the initial reviewed pattern or subset. |
| **Architecturally right, didactically thin** | The family is admissible, but readers still need project notes to understand what the pattern really governs. | Trust in the monolith depends on external context rather than the pattern text. | Add the missing problem frame, worked slices, local definitions, and governing-pattern or project-side FPF kind and reference named by value guidance before admission. |
| **Scenario-name grounding** | Grounding names a situation but does not show what the source and resulting publication actually look like. | Readers cannot tell why the case stays in the family or where it leaves the family. | Add concrete source and resulting-publication slices, especially for transform families and easy boundary confusions. |
| **Generic-head underspecification** | An FPF-governed phrase uses a generic head such as `note`, `view`, `guidance`, `output`, or `artifact`, but the run leaves that head uninterpreted. | Review discusses the sentence before the object kind is even stable. | Restore the head kind first in pattern-local terms before accepting or comparing the sentence. |
| **Qualifier-smuggled claim kind or admissible-use boundary** | A modifier such as `comparative`, `safe`, `interactive`, `reliable`, or `faithful` is doing the semantic work while the run treats the phrase as already precise. | The review blesses apparent precision without recovering the actual claim kind or admissible-use boundary. | Unpack the qualifier into explicit claim kind or admissible-use boundary, comparison criterion, or downstream-use boundary before acceptance. |
| **Mixed comparison criterion** | One sentence compares or ranks publication-form, carrier, process, authority-reference, or project-record values on one comparison criterion. | The sentence remains ontologically incoherent even after local wording is polished. | Restore head kind, then qualifier claim kind or admissible-use boundary, then rewrite the comparison through a homogeneous claim-kind criterion, threshold, or named governing-pattern/source-relation condition. |
| **Sentence-level shorthand drift** | A few innocent-looking words (“species”, “branch”, “flow”, “input/output”) quietly carry the claim kind or admissible-use boundary. | Review passes while key relations remain implicit or wrong. | Inspect FPF-governed sentences one by one and replace shorthand with explicit governing-pattern relations and package relations or publication language. |
| **Package-form, governing-pattern relation, and package-relation drift** | The text slides between `family`, `bundle`, `cluster`, `profile`, `overlay`, `suite`, `kit`, or `record` without showing that the ontology changed. | Reviews miss governing-pattern or authority-reference blur because each local sentence still sounds plausible. | Require one intended package-function word, check governing-pattern relation and package relation explicitly, and treat stylistic noun-swapping as a semantic defect. |
| **Reader-fit leakage** | Pattern sections explain why the pattern was isolated, what landing form is safest, or why merge/freeze is premature. | Review accepts a package memo disguised as a user pattern. | Move package-development reasoning to companions; rewrite pattern sections in terms of what the user may do, must avoid, and which governing FPF pattern or named project-side FPF kind and reference governs the release, policy, assurance, gate, action-selection, or adjudication case. |
| **Quality-carrier leakage** | Pattern prose explains corpus projection, retrieval evidence, monolith parity, landing evidence, `PatternQualityStatus`, all-`4`/all-`5` posture, or development correspondence as if it were user guidance. | Review accepts quality proof or package evidence disguised as pattern content. | Move it to the governing `E.21`, E.19 findings, README/ToC/E.11/I.2, projection, release, or landing result; keep only the user-facing move or boundary justified by that evidence. |
| **Apparatus overwrap** | A simple claim, relation, object, action, or placement is wrapped in role-word, carrier, locus, flow, state, status, text, package, or process language that adds no new kind or user-facing action. | Review accepts bureaucratic prose as precision, or replaces it with prettier prose that loses the FPF kind. | First ask whether the extra word changes a recoverable kind, relation, claim kind, admissible use, evidence value, or user-facing action. If yes, use precision restoration. If no, rewrite in plain FPF terms and verify kind preservation: same `EntityOfConcern`, head kind, relation or claim kind, and established FPF term. |
| **Companion material retained by inertia** | A companion note, profile, check sheet, companion row, or review harness remains attached to a pattern family after the pattern body already carries the usable guidance, but the text does not say what real breakage returns if that companion material is absent. | Companion material becomes permanent local folklore, hidden authority, or reader cost without a corresponding use gain. | State the companion-use question, governing source, companion-only use, real breakage if absent, and retention, accepted-source-material-only, or removal condition; otherwise fold the useful example into the pattern or keep it only in the accepted source material. |
| **Pattern-quality result as project certificate** | An `E.19` pass is cited as proof that a project release, safety claim, compliance state, work result, publication, or gate has passed. | Collapses FPF pattern-quality review into project-world evidence or gate authority. | Keep `E.19` as pattern-quality review; open `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `A.15`, or another governing pattern for the project-side claim being made. |

### E.19:9 - Consequences

| Benefits                                                                         | Trade-offs and mitigations                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Repeatable admission decisions** — reviewers share a common review language.     | More explicit editorial work; mitigated by a small baseline and risk-selected profiles.        |
| **Higher trust in normative content** — CC becomes the enforceable conformance check set. | Authors must align prose and CC carefully; mitigated by coherence checks.                  |
| **Controlled evolution** — runs prevent conceptual bit-rot.              | Periodic workload; mitigated by prioritizing high-dependency and high-risk patterns first. |
| **Less hidden drift** — terminology and cross-context reuse become explicit.     | Some drafts will be delayed; mitigated by early profile selection during authoring.        |

### E.19:10 - Rationale

Patterns are both **teaching publications** and **normative guidance publications**. A specification that grows without explicit quality gates becomes a patchwork: locally good, globally inconsistent. A profile-based gate is the smallest structure that keeps reviews repeatable while remaining sensitive to risk and pattern kind.

The baseline profile protects cross-pattern comparability and editorial sanity. Risk-selected profiles keep depth where it matters: norms, SoTA claims, cross-context reuse, terminology changes, staleness refresh, and reader fit. A pattern that is admissible in package terms but speaks to the wrong reader is still a review defect.

### E.19:11 - SoTA-Echoing - post-2015 review and validation practice alignment

**Evidence binding note.** If a SoTA Synthesis Pack exists for review and validation discipline or refresh discipline in your Context, cite it and keep this section consistent with it. Otherwise, use the table below as the current source-use basis for this pattern revision; do not duplicate it elsewhere as a seed list or treat reference sources as automatic SoTA.

| Claim (E.19 need) | SoTA practice (post-2015) | Source-use relation | Primary source (post-2015) | Alignment with E.19 | Adoption status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A stable structure improves comparability and reduces ambiguity. | Standards specify required viewpoints, concerns, consistency rules, and description structure. | **Current-standard and reference-only source use.** This source supplies the conformance-vs-tooling and structured-description analogy; it is not imported as FPF pattern ontology or as the current-best answer for pattern review. | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022, *Software, systems and enterprise - Architecture description*. | `PCP-BASE` includes structural integrity, internal consistency, and named profile scope without turning review into one architecture-description process. | **Adopt and adapt.** Adopt conformance mindset; adapt to pattern-language template and didactic grounding. |
| Pattern writing benefits from explicit guidance plus critique culture. | Pattern-language communities emphasize clear template usage, consequences, examples, and critique for quality. | **Current practice and writing-guidance source use.** This row contributes recognition-text and section-quality review, not FPF ontology. | Iba (2021), “How to Write Patterns: A Practical Guide for Creating a Pattern Language on Human Actions” (PLoP 2021 PLoPourri). | Baseline checks enforce meaningful sections; anti-patterns make critique concrete; `E.19:7` checks recognition text, worked slices, consequences, and SoTA row usefulness. | **Adopt.** Directly improves admission quality. |
| “Living” guidance needs refresh discipline. | Reporting and review guidance is updated and versioned; reviewers track changes and report deltas clearly. | **Current reporting-reference source use.** PRISMA supplies transparent updated-guidance and delta-reporting discipline; it is not imported as a mandatory FPF review workflow. | Page et al. (2021), “The PRISMA 2020 statement: an updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews”; Page et al. (2021), “PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration: updated guidance and exemplars for reporting systematic reviews”. | Runs require explicit decisions and deltas in SoTA-Echoing; `PCP-REFRESH` asks whether stale SoTA, renamed relations, terminology drift, or refresh windows change the pattern. | **Adapt.** Use the versioned-guidance and explicit-delta principle without importing medical-review reporting forms or process mandates. |
| Retrieval-facing entry changes need selected evidence dimensions, not universal benchmarks. | RAG evaluation practice separates context relevance, answer faithfulness, answer relevance, and retrieved-context adequacy. | **Current practice source use for retrieval-facing evidence dimensions.** RAGAS and ARES are representative current RAG evaluation source refs for the selected retrieval fixture only; they are not current-best source material for all pattern entry or pattern quality. | Es, James, Espinosa-Anke, Schockaert (2023 arXiv; 2024 EACL demo), “RAGAS: Automated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation”; Saad-Falcon, Khattab, Potts, Zaharia (2023 arXiv; 2024 NAACL), “ARES: An Automated Evaluation Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems”. | `PCP-ENTRY-E4` and related evidence modes select tiny retrieval fixtures only when retrieval-facing behavior or observed misretrieval is present; the row does not authorize a universal benchmark for every pattern entry. | **Adopt lightly.** Keep retrieval hit, source-material relevance, authority, and faithfulness dimensions only when retrieval-facing behavior is present; ordinary entry prose remains prose-only. |

Action result from the pattern-review and validation practice grounding: an `E.19` pass, caution, return-for-repair result, clean checklist, or clean retrieval-entry check does not become project certification, project evidence, safety-assurance material, gate input, release justification, compliance-assurance material, assurance material, work authority, publication truth, or project refusal or approval. The local E.19 result is a pattern-quality review or refresh claim over the named reviewed pattern, selected profile, defects found or cleared, admission, refresh, repair-return, or selected pattern-quality boundary. Reopen the pattern-quality result when the reviewed text, accepted-source-material decision, SoTA grounding, related governing pattern, selected companion or projection function, profile trigger, review boundary, or attempted project-side reuse changes.

### E.19:12 - Relations

* **Builds on:**

  * `E.8` (authoring conventions; canonical section order; SoTA‑Echoing authoring requirements)
  * `E.10` (lexical discipline, trigger detection, and applicability)
  * `E.10.ARCH` (distributed precision-restoration architecture and realization/governing-pattern split)
  * `E.9` (design rationale records for changes that affect semantics)
  * `E.9.DA` (scoped DRR decision-adequacy evaluations before pattern drafting or host amendment; an `E.19` finding may expose that an upstream `DRR` did not decide enough, but `E.19` keeps the pattern-review finding while `E.9.DA` evaluates only the upstream `DRR` decision-adequacy claim. An `E.19` pass, return, or absence is not `E.9.DA` coordinate evidence.)
  * `E.22` (improvement-oriented quality-evaluation question framing; distinguishes floor blocker review, exceptional-improvement review, Pareto trade-off inspection, open-question discovery, and absorption impact before the `E.19` review result is formed.)
  * `E.23` (repeated quality-improvement method; an `E.19` profile can supply findings inside such a loop, but `E.23` governs repeated absorption, object-under-improvement evaluation re-evaluation, method-family selection, and stop, continue, switch method, open-new-frame, or hold decisions.)

  * `E.15` (authoring/evolution protocol; harness mindset; refresh planning)
  * `A.6.5` (slot discipline; SlotKind/ValueKind/refMode invariants)
* **Coordinates with:**

  * `F.8` (mint vs reuse decisions)
  * `F.18` (local-first naming protocol)
  * `F.9` (cross-context alignment discipline)
  * `F.15` (conceptual harness and regression framing)
  * `E.17` (MVPK / `U.View` projection discipline)
  * `E.11` (pattern-entry discoverability discipline, for `PCP-ENTRY` only as a review hook, not as a semantic prerequisite)
  * `E.13` (pragmatic utility and proxy-to-value alignment when a pattern-quality pass, score, coordinate value, checklist result, benchmark, projection signal, or release posture is being used as value evidence)
  * `E.21` (scoped pattern-quality characteristic space, coordinate evidence discipline, `PatternQualityStatus`, and stop condition; `E.19` findings may supply evidence for a later `E.21` value only when they identify content defects or strengths in the reviewed pattern version, but final coordinate values and `PatternQualityStatus` are assigned by `E.21`, not by `E.19`)

  * `A.6.7` (`MechSuiteDescription` suite-level semantics)
  * `A.15.3` (`SlotFillingsPlanItem` P2W planned-baseline seam)
  * `G.11` (refresh/decay orchestration principles, where applicable)
