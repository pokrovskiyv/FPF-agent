## E.11.PFP - Framework Publication Form Profile

> **Type:** Specialization of E.11
> **Status:** Candidate
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative.

### E.11.PFP:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when one FPF, DPF, or LPF edition needs a public Markdown form that a cold reader can enter and a small deterministic checker can recognize. The framework's pattern set, product boundary, and edition values must already be selected for the publication being assembled or checked.

The first useful result is a form application that names the edition source, the public units that bear its projections, and each missing, reordered, duplicated, unresolved, or mismatched form element. A passing form check does not accept the edition, prove framework adequacy, identify a carrier, or establish a publication occurrence.

Do not use this pattern to decide whether one pattern set is a framework, whether a catalogue or guide is another product, or whether an edition is current or available. Use the E.4 family for the product and framework boundary, E.24.PUB for publication occurrence and carrier relations, and the applicable decision, quality, and currentness patterns for those claims.

### E.11.PFP:2 - Problem

FPF-family publications can expose the same useful material through different headings, edition labels, index layouts, and Readme cards. A familiar reader can compensate. A cold reader or parser cannot reliably tell which edition is present, which index is authoritative, whether several Part tables form one index, or whether a support table is a rival front door.

The opposite repair is also harmful. A rigid carrier template can put authorship, credits, dates, status, dependencies, build details, and maintainer records ahead of the reader's question whether or not those facts change the reader's choice. It can also force a catalogue, inquiry programme, guide, or other adjacent product to pretend that it is a framework edition. The common form must therefore be exact where shared recognition matters, practitioner-first in its opening, and explicitly limited to framework editions.

### E.11.PFP:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Cold-reader entry | Stable labels and order reduce search cost, but edition administration must not displace practical entry or the pattern bodies. |
| Exact edition return | Readers need a stable public designation and locator, while dates, filenames, statuses, and build digests must not become edition identity. |
| One logical index | FPF-family editions need one authoritative pattern index, while visible Part or placement groups remain useful. |
| Product variation | FPF, DPF, and LPF editions share a front form, but their body, reference tail, and choice-relevant public cues differ. |
| Product boundary | Support units may belong to one framework product; independently useful adjacent products need their own identity, form, access, and maintenance. |
| Deterministic checking | Syntax checks should be reproducible, but they must not infer table purpose, product truth, or reader value from prose. |
| Form and carrier separation | One form may be borne by several carriers, and one outer carrier may expose several products, without merging their identities. |
| Accessibility and translation | Predictable headings and navigation aid many readers and tools, while one English label set cannot silently stand in for every language or access need. |

### E.11.PFP:4 - Solution

Apply one common reader-facing publication form to one FPF, DPF, or LPF edition. The profile is the reusable rule for that form. It is not the form itself, the presentation carrier that bears the form, the edition expressed by it, or the publication occurrence that makes the edition available.

#### E.11.PFP:4.1 - Preserve the compact product opening

For an all-in-one Markdown publication, preserve the product-declared compact opening and use this H1 route:

1. `# <product-declared publication title>`;
2. `# Table of Contents`;
3. the exact product-declared Readme H1;
4. the exact product-declared Preface H1;
5. the pattern bodies or pattern collection in the order selected by that edition; and
6. reference and maintenance material under headings declared by the product pattern.

The title and Readme H1 are separate product declarations. A checker receives both exact strings; it does not derive the Readme H1 by concatenating `Readme` to a longer carrier title. The common profile does not insert a metadata block, edition record, warning, or other lines into a compact predecessor opening merely to make products look alike. A product-specific builder may pin a compact front shape, including the line at which the ToC begins, when that shape protects an established reader entry.

Between the title and ToC, retain only the shortest public cues already justified by product use. An exact edition designation or locator belongs there only when its possible values change the reader's next use, reliance, return, language, dependency, or access choice. When such a cue is present, project it from one product-owned edition or relation record; do not maintain a second editable copy. Add authorship, credit, date, dependency, language, access, or a product-declared maintenance status, support window, or currentness window only under the same next-working-move test. A date is a cue, not edition identity, and a visible status or window is not evidence of acceptance, currentness, maintenance, availability, access, or authorization.

Reader front matter extends from the opening title through the Readme and Preface up to the first pattern-body collection H1. It must not contain campaign keys; candidate, review, or result identifiers; local disk or repository paths; source or candidate digests; Git commits or blobs; generated comments; build commands; machine warnings; or "do not edit" instructions. Detailed edition, provenance, rebuildability, and maintenance records remain adjacent maintainer evidence or product-declared reference-tail material unless a separately selected public use justifies a reader-facing projection.

#### E.11.PFP:4.2 - Put public units into the established Table of Contents

Immediately after the single `# Table of Contents` H1, continue the product's established ToC grammar. Represent the exact Readme and Preface before the logical pattern index using the same kind of labelled segment and rows already used for non-pattern units in that product. When an established ToC already represents Preface and pattern groups, add Readme there; do not invent a generic `Publication route`, a second mini-menu, or a new table shape. A non-pattern publication unit receives no fabricated PatternID. Its product-declared entry remains mechanically recognizable and, when the carrier supports links, resolves to the exact unit.

Place the one authoritative logical pattern index after those public-unit entries. It may be one table or several ordered, uniquely labelled Part or placement segments. Every authoritative segment uses:

```text
| § | ID & Title | Status | Keywords & Search Queries | Dependencies |
```

Across all segments, every pattern body has exactly one row, every row resolves to exactly one body, and no PatternID appears twice. A Part label groups rows for navigation; it is not a pattern row, a semantic parent, or another index.

PatternID, title, Part, and `§` position remain separate even when one row displays them together. PatternID supplies the stable public address within the named framework; the title explains the pattern; Part and `§` show where the current edition places it. Within each Part, the ToC rows and pattern bodies follow the same order. That order need not ascend by PatternID, and moving or retitling a pattern does not by itself change its PatternID.

When the surrounding text does not already identify the framework, name the framework together with the PatternID. To select the body published in one edition, also name that framework edition. For a DPF, `E.4.DPF` supplies the choice of reference code and local locator, and the continuity decision; this profile only makes the selected distinctions visible in the publication.

Reserve `Support index — <lookup job>` for a secondary pattern lookup. Its exact header is:

```text
| PatternID | Pattern title | Lookup use |
```

Ordinary relation, source-return, maintenance, and reference tables may cite PatternIDs under truthful headings and other complete headers. Do not infer that they are indexes from their cell values. Reject a second `# Table of Contents`, a `Pattern Index` heading for the same job, an authoritative header outside the authoritative ToC region, or a support heading and header that do not occur together. Public-unit entries are navigation inside the one ToC, not another pattern catalogue.

#### E.11.PFP:4.3 - Keep one practical-entry set and two visible forms

Start the Readme body with `## Practical entries`. The product maintains one declaration for every selectable example and assigns each key exactly one public form: ordinary practical entry or Practical-Use Card. Each declared key occurs once, at H3 for an ordinary entry or at H4 for a card. A compact locator may precede or follow these examples, but it is a finding aid rather than another editable entry set.

The Readme says plainly that its entries are selected examples, not a catalogue or coverage boundary. It tells the reader to bring the actual question and to use the product's index, direct patterns, or another finding aid when no example fits. The selected examples should make two uses visible without implying that every question belongs to either displayed case:

- an ordinary entry shows how one direct pattern or one bounded direct route can answer a comparatively simple difficulty without a mantra; and
- a Practical-Use Card shows a recurring complex difficulty whose useful answer spans several direct pattern contributions and whose long dependency is easier to retain with a mantra.

Use this ordinary-entry form:

```text
### <ordinary-entry key> — <plain title>

- **Situation:** <recognizable working situation>
- **Question:** <practical question>
- **First useful result or honest blocker:** <smallest useful result or exact blocker>
- **Start with:** <direct PatternID or bounded plausible set>
- **Stop or return:** <ordinary stop, wrong-turn return, or reopen condition>
```

When the product selects at least one card, place all selected cards under one group:

```text
### Practical-Use Cards

<plain statement that these are selected examples of extended cross-pattern use, not a catalogue or prescribed workflow>

#### <card key> — <plain title>

- **Situation:** <recognizable recurring difficulty>
- **Question:** <practical question>
- **First useful result or honest blocker:** <smallest useful result or exact blocker>
- **Mantra:** <plain repeatable wording that retains the cross-pattern dependency>
- **Start with:** <direct PatternIDs or bounded route>
- **Stop or return:** <ordinary stop, wrong-turn return, or reopen condition>

##### Expansion for <card key>

<optional explanation only>
```

`### Practical-Use Cards` is a group inside the one `Practical entries` set, not another front door or selectable key. Omit the group when the product selects no cards. The card's canonical structural field is `Mantra`; its value begins directly with the repeatable wording and needs no `Local`/`Long` prefix. A local reminder for one direct pattern or bounded result may remain in that pattern, an ordinary entry, or other teaching material, but it does not by itself select the richer card form. `E.11` owns this content decision.

Every selectable ordinary entry and card shares one product-wide semantic-key namespace. The product declaration assigns each key one form, so a key cannot occur as both H3 and H4. An H5 expansion repeats its enclosing card key only to attach optional explanation; it is not another selectable occurrence. A card has zero or one expansion. Its compact portion ends after `Stop or return`; the expansion ends at the next H4-or-higher heading or the end of the group. The expansion may explain branch choices, examples, or exact result support, but cannot contain another H4 card or H5 expansion.

The product-language application declares one deterministic reading-burden measure and two maxima: one for the mantra and one for the complete compact card. The measure must suit the publication language; whitespace counting is suitable only where it meaningfully measures reading burden. The maxima protect scanability and recall. They are not targets, proof of reader value, a fixed card count, or authority to delete a choice-changing distinction. Content that a compact card cannot carry truthfully returns to the direct patterns or, only when first choice needs it, the same-key expansion.

Applying this grammar does not select a card, prove that the examples cover the product, or show that every cited pattern is needed in a particular case. `E.11` defines the direct-entry/card comparison, cross-pattern mnemonic-gain test, and non-exhaustive discoverability purpose. The product-specific E.4 pattern declares its selected example keys, forms, reading-burden measure, and two limits. A validator consumes those values and checks structure; it does not decide content value.

This profile keeps structural field keys in canonical English. A translation may translate surrounding prose and values and may add a human-readable gloss, but it does not silently replace or reorder the field keys. A translated structural-key profile needs a separately selected recovery and checking rule. Test translated and low-tool publications with actual readers and navigation tools rather than treating English parser success as accessibility evidence.

#### E.11.PFP:4.4 - Keep support units and adjacent products distinct

A Readme, Preface, ToC, pattern-body collection, framework-scale structure or coverage account, relation or edition note, and refresh route may be publication units of one framework product when they share its declared readers and use, edition boundary, access, maintainer, and change cadence. A unit does not become another product merely because it is outside the pattern set or stored in another file.

An adjacent result is a separate maintained product when people need to change, cite, use, or maintain it independently. Look for its own useful identity, version or current state, users and use, rule saying what content belongs, access route, maintenance commitment, refresh or retirement rule, or cross-framework reuse or reliance. Examples include a source registry, MethodDescription collection, decision-support publication, inquiry evidence package, practitioner guide, pedagogical companion, catalogue, tool reference, access service, or inquiry programme. This is an open list; those labels do not decide the boundary by themselves.

When the adjacent result is independently maintained, point from the framework to its exact edition or state. An annex may carry a declared snapshot or projection, but it returns to the authoritative product and does not fork it. When no independent boundary is useful and ordinary framework use needs the material, include it as a named support publication unit of the framework product.

One outer presentation carrier may expose several products. The carrier stays neutral: each product keeps its own identity, edition or state, status, form, access, and maintenance boundary. Apply this profile only to FPF, DPF, or LPF constituents. A catalogue, evidence package, guide, service, programme, or other non-framework product uses the form selected for its own kind and receives no invented framework family, dependency field, or pattern index.

DRRs, build manifests, quality runs, digests, logs, and campaign state are process or maintainer evidence by default. They become reader products only after a separately selected public use gives them their own product boundary.

#### E.11.PFP:4.5 - Check syntax and product truth at the right boundary

The common form check handles only recoverable syntax and projection agreement:

- the product-declared title and Readme H1, the compact opening, and absence of prohibited development or machine material from reader front matter;
- the required H1 sequence plus the product-declared body and reference tail;
- product-declared Readme and Preface entries in the established ToC grammar, before the logical pattern index, with no generic rival mini-menu;
- authoritative index segments, aggregate row/body bijection, duplicates, and reserved support-index grammar;
- the Readme's one practical-entry set; its explicit examples-not-coverage statement; the product's declaration of example keys and forms; exactly one H3 ordinary entry or H4 card per declared key; five ordered ordinary-entry fields; a non-empty card-group explanation; six ordered card fields; the shared reading-burden measure and mantra/card limits; and zero or one same-key H5 expansion with the declared boundary; and
- equality and source agreement of every optional public cue that is actually projected.

For Markdown grouping, one canonical bounded invocation runs the focused source-hazard guard and a parser-backed render together. It returns the rendered heading outline and block, list, table, code, and link structure for inspection while the candidate is already loaded. The agent does not discover a second renderer or reread the same file merely to close that form question. A clean mechanical result supports but does not replace the reader-visible judgement.

The product-specific check compares every visible cue with the exact edition or relation record from which it was projected and checks the product-specific body, reference tail, and any pinned compact-front shape. A syntax-valid but unresolved value fails there. A field absent from the public opening is not a form defect unless a selected reader use and product-specific rule require it.

Neither check decides framework scale from pattern count. Report `pattern_count = 1` as a diagnostic. Use E.4, E.4.PFAD, E.4.DPF.DA, E.11, E.21, and the applicable subject patterns to judge whether the result is a usable pattern language for its declared field and first use.

#### E.11.PFP:4.6 - Return the form result without overclaiming

Return the exact framework edition, edition-record source, carriers checked, form units found, public-cue agreement, logical-index result, practical-entry declaration and form result, product-specific tail checked, and every mismatch or unresolved ref. Say separately whether the edition, carrier, publication occurrence, availability, currentness, or framework adequacy has an applicable result. Do not infer those claims or the truthfulness of card selection from form conformance.

### E.11.PFP:5 - Archetypal Grounding

**DPF with non-ascending pattern addresses.** A Systems Engineering DPF edition orders `SYSE.1`, `SYSE.16`, `SYSE.17`, and `SYSE.2` because that sequence helps readers. Its ToC rows and H2 bodies follow the same order. The `§` column reports each current position; it is not part of the PatternID. A later move changes the rows and bodies together without renumbering a continuing pattern. A citation outside the carrier says `Systems Engineering DPF, SYSE.16`; one intended to recover the earlier body also names the edition.

**DPF, all-in-one and low-tool.** A horticulture DPF is distributed as one Markdown file and a printed copy. Both open with the public framework name and `Edition: Horticulture DPF 2.1`; the Markdown line links to a public edition page and the print line gives the same public address. The ToC, practical entries, Preface, four pattern bodies, coverage account, and refresh note follow. Authorship, source provenance, and change history remain reachable after the bodies. Readers can identify and return to the edition without crossing build records before their first working question.

**FPF, split carriers.** One website exposes an FPF edition through a front page and a separately downloadable Readme. The front page already identifies the edition, so its embedded Readme begins with practical entries. The standalone Readme repeats only the short edition line because it can circulate alone. Both return to the same public edition record; neither mints another edition or editable status copy.

**LPF with a choice-relevant cue.** An LPF supports two public language editions whose maintenance windows differ. The product-specific rule shows one short language-and-support cue after `Edition` because it changes which edition a practitioner should use. It does not copy the maintainer, build digest, source path, or complete dependency record into the opening.

**Adjacent product.** A separately maintained horticulture source registry has its own current state, users, selection rule, access route, and refresh commitment. The DPF points to that state; copying a snapshot into an annex does not create a second authoritative registry. One combined website may expose both, but the registry retains its catalogue form and receives no invented framework fields.

**Near miss.** A relation table has rows whose first cells are PatternIDs and titles, followed by relation and source-return columns. It remains a relation table. A checker that calls it another pattern index from those cell values is guessing semantics from data shape and fails this profile.

### E.11.PFP:6 - Bias-Annotation

**Scope:** Limited to the public Markdown form of an FPF, DPF, or LPF edition and faithful low-tool projections of that form. It is not a universal publication template and does not prescribe the form of an adjacent guide, catalogue, service, programme, evidence package, or maintainer record.

| Lens | Likely drift | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gov | A visible status or form pass is read as acceptance, authority, release, or currentness. | Keep those claims under their own decisions and relations; the form only exposes selected public cues. |
| Arch | A file, website, or combined package is treated as the product or edition, or every nearby result is forced into the framework form. | Name edition, publication form, carrier, occurrence, support unit, and adjacent product separately; apply this profile only to framework constituents. |
| Onto-Epist | A date, filename, digest, or editable front block becomes edition identity or evidence that a relation obtains. | Use one stable public designation and edition-record return; project only exact facts from their own records. |
| Prag | Administrative completeness displaces the reader's first question, or an optional cue appears without changing use. | Put the smallest useful edition cue first, then the ToC and practical entries; require a named reader decision for every extra front cue. |
| Did | Predictable labels become rigid English-only machinery, terse navigation hides the patterns needed to act, examples read as a coverage catalogue, or compactness deletes a choice-changing distinction. | Keep recognizable headings, the five-field ordinary form and six-field card form, explicit non-exhaustive wording, one product-language burden measure with mantra/card maxima, useful detail, and direct-pattern return; test translations, low-tool carriers, navigation, and mnemonic recall with intended readers. |

### E.11.PFP:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Passing condition |
| --- | --- |
| CC-PFP.1 Scope truthful | The form expresses one named FPF, DPF, or LPF edition; no carrier or adjacent product is relabelled as that edition. |
| CC-PFP.2 Practitioner-first opening | The compact product-declared opening leads directly to the ToC; the common profile has not inserted a record or completeness block ahead of the reader's question. |
| CC-PFP.3 Edition return works when needed | When exact edition return changes use or reliance, the shortest public designation and locator resolve without repository knowledge; otherwise no unused return field is mandatory. |
| CC-PFP.4 Extra cues earn their place | Every cue before the ToC is projected from its exact record and changes a named reader decision or action; no common optional field is required merely for completeness. |
| CC-PFP.5 Development state excluded | Reader front matter contains no campaign or candidate identifier, local path, digest, Git identity, generated comment, build command, machine warning, or maintainer instruction. |
| CC-PFP.6 Entries and order recognizable | The title, compact cues, ToC, Readme and Preface entries in the product's established ToC grammar, Readme, Preface, pattern collection, and product-declared reference tail occur in the selected order; every declared target resolves where links are used. |
| CC-PFP.7 Logical index and order truthful | One logical index may use several labelled segments, but every pattern row resolves to one body, every body has one row, and PatternIDs are unique within the named framework. PatternID is separate from title, Part, and `§` position; ToC and body order agree within each Part even when PatternIDs are non-ascending. When the surrounding text does not identify the framework, a citation names the framework together with the PatternID; a citation selecting the body published in one edition also names that edition. |
| CC-PFP.8 Other tables remain truthful | Only the closed authoritative and support-index grammars are treated as indexes; relation and reference tables are not reclassified from cell values. |
| CC-PFP.9 One entry set and declaration | One `Practical entries` set contains every selectable ordinary entry and selected card. One declaration for the product assigns every key exactly one form; each key has exactly one selectable H3 ordinary-entry or H4 card occurrence, and no rival key list or entry set exists. |
| CC-PFP.9a Ordinary entry usable | Every ordinary entry gives the five fields in order and retains any richer content needed for the first useful result and stop boundary. No mantra is forced onto a locator or ordinary entry. |
| CC-PFP.9b Selected card usable | Every selected card gives the six fields in order, begins its `Mantra` value directly with repeatable plain wording, preserves a real path through several direct pattern contributions, returns to those patterns, and has zero or one same-key H5 expansion outside the compact card. Applying the form is not evidence that the card should have been selected. |
| CC-PFP.9c Product-language guard shared | The product declares one measurable language-appropriate reading-burden rule plus mantra and compact-card maxima, and authoring and validation consume the same values. Canonical English field keys do not make whitespace limits universal. The limits check compactness; they neither select cards nor prove example coverage. |
| CC-PFP.10 Readme projection restrained | A standalone Readme repeats a short edition cue only when circulating without it would change use or return; it does not duplicate the edition or rebuildability record. |
| CC-PFP.11 Product boundary preserved | Framework support units share the declared framework boundary; independently useful adjacent products retain their own identity, form, access, and maintenance. |
| CC-PFP.12 Combined carrier neutral | Every constituent product keeps its own form and identity; E.11.PFP applies only to framework constituents. |
| CC-PFP.13 Claims remain separate | Form conformance is not reported as acceptance, adequacy, carrier identity, publication, availability, access, maintenance, or currentness. |
| CC-PFP.14 Scope examples survive | The rule remains usable for FPF, DPF, and LPF editions and for a low-tool or non-clickable carrier without introducing a second edition identity. |
| CC-PFP.15 Navigation remains usable | The ToC represents Readme and Preface in its established product-native grammar before the singular pattern index; headings and labels describe their purpose, and the integrated rendered-structure summary plus intended-reader inspection exposes grouping defects without a second full read. |

### E.11.PFP:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Complete record before entry | A maintainer detail—such as authorship, assistance, date, dependency, provenance, a product-declared maintenance status, support window, or currentness window—or the whole edition record appears before the ToC merely because it exists. | Preserve the product's compact opening; project only cues whose possible values change a named reader move and keep the full record in maintainer evidence or the justified reference tail. |
| Development state as public identity | Candidate keys, local paths, digests, commits, blobs, generated comments, or machine warnings describe the publication to readers. | Keep them in builder or maintainer evidence; publish a stable designation and public return. |
| Date as edition identity | Two editions on one day become indistinguishable. | Use a stable public designation linked to the exact edition record; show a date only when it changes reader use. |
| Fresh navigation grammar | A generic mini-menu is inserted ahead of an established ToC, duplicating units and making one product unlike itself. | Extend the product's existing non-pattern ToC segment and make the checker recognize that exact grammar. |
| Flat-index compulsion | Visible Part grouping is removed merely to satisfy one-table code. | Check one logical index across consistently headed, uniquely labelled segments. |
| Index by cell guess | A relation or source-return table is rejected because it cites PatternIDs and titles. | Recognize only the closed authoritative and support-index grammars. |
| Position used as PatternID | Patterns are renumbered when the ToC changes, or identifier order is read as dependency, Method order, or semantic hierarchy. | Keep PatternID stable while the pattern continues, show current `§` position separately, keep ToC and body order aligned, and state every substantive relation in its own field or claim. |
| Readme as another edition | The standalone Readme mints its own designation or copies a full editable record. | Repeat only the shortest cue whose absence would change use or return when the Readme circulates independently; never duplicate the edition or rebuildability record. |
| Outside the pattern set means another product | A Preface, coverage account, or refresh note is split into a product with no independent use. | Keep it as a named support unit when it shares the framework boundary. |
| Shared use means one product | A cross-framework registry or service is absorbed into one DPF. | Treat shared use as a prompt to inspect the boundary; preserve an independent product when its own use and maintenance make that useful. |
| Combined carrier merges products | A framework and catalogue receive one identity and one framework index. | Keep the outer carrier neutral and each constituent in its own selected form. |
| Parser pass as accessibility | Canonical English labels parse, so translation, assistive navigation, low-tool return, and cold-reader use are assumed. | Test the actual carrier and reader route; repair headings, labels, links, projections, and mnemonic wording without weakening source return. |
| Rival entry sets or key registries | Ordinary entries and cards are maintained as separate front doors or the same key appears once in each list. | Keep one `Practical entries` set and one declaration for the product that assigns every selectable key one form and one occurrence. |
| Card classification by syntax | An H4, six fields, a short body, or a historical label is treated as proof that the reader needs a card. | Use `E.11` to compare the same truthful content without a mantra; the form checker only verifies the selected form. |
| One candidate's labels, example inventory, and limits made universal | Another product must publish the same topics or another language must use one candidate's labels and whitespace limits even when they do not support its readers. | Preserve the shared field order and direct-versus-cross-pattern distinction, but let each product select its non-exhaustive examples and declare one suitable measure with mantra/card maxima. |

### E.11.PFP:9 - Consequences

Readers retain each product's compact familiar opening and find Readme and Preface in the ToC grammar already used by that product, before the one authoritative pattern index. Inside the Readme they see one explicitly non-exhaustive practical-entry set: ordinary examples show cheap direct use, while only honestly selected cross-pattern cards add a visible mantra and an optional bounded expansion. Optional public cues remain recoverable from one source when they change use, while development and rebuildability records stay out of reader front matter. Builders gain checks that fail on missing public-unit entries, duplicate or cross-form keys, card grammar, structural, projection, and development-state drift without guessing table meaning, deciding card value or coverage, inventing a rival navigation block, or forcing a second renderer-discovery pass.

### E.11.PFP:10 - Rationale

The shared rule fixes only the recognition points whose reuse pays across FPF, DPF, and LPF: a compact product-declared opening, Readme and Preface represented in the established ToC grammar, one logical pattern index, one explicitly non-exhaustive practical-entry set with five-field ordinary examples and six-field selected cards, truthful product boundaries, and recognizable major units. It leaves titles, optional public cues, the exact product-native ToC segment, example selection, the reading-burden measure and two limits, front line shape, and reference tails with the product-specific rule because their value depends on the reader's choice and publication language. Limiting the profile this way preserves deterministic checking without turning one product's navigation experiment, example inventory, or maintenance record into a universal reader experience.

### E.11.PFP:11 - SoTA-Echoing

The comparisons below apply the canonical definition and positive comparison contract in `E.8:11`; this section does not redefine SoTA or rank a source by status.

| Practice question | Best-known line | Serious alternative or default | Defect overcome and E.11.PFP mutation | Source roles and limits | Reopen condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| How should one public FPF, DPF, or LPF edition give a cold reader an actionable front without confusing navigation, product identity, or maintainer evidence? | The best-known line for this bounded use combines `E.11` situation-first entry with the edition, body, publication, and carrier boundaries in `E.4.FPF`, `E.4.DPF`, and `E.24.PUB`: use a compact product-declared opening, one authoritative ToC, one non-exhaustive practical-entry set, exact returns to full pattern bodies, and only those public cues whose possible values change the reader's next move. | A metadata-first documentation template or wholesale adoption of a four-mode documentation architecture is the serious popular default. Diátaxis supplies the strongest current form of the action-first alternative; WCAG 2.2 supplies the serious narrower comparator for headings, labels, consistent navigation, and more than one finding route. | The metadata-first default delays use and duplicates maintainer records; a rigid document-mode taxonomy can split or replace the FPF pattern body; accessibility criteria alone cannot decide edition identity, body membership, or product truth. **Adapt:** sections 4.1–4.5, Grounding, and `CC-PFP.2–10/14–15` keep the reader move, authoritative index, truthful labels, stable headings, and source return together. **Reject:** a universal document taxonomy, a mandatory metadata front, and any claim that form or parser conformance establishes accessibility, identity, adequacy, or publication. | Current FPF patterns supply the selected product-specific line. Diátaxis [*Start here*](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/) and [*How-to guides*](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/) are popular-practice comparators because their content starts from a reader goal, not because they are widely praised or maintained. [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) is a narrow accessibility comparator because its navigation and labelling criteria change the checks; its Recommendation status supplies no rank and it does not validate this profile or define an FPF-family product. | Reopen if translated, assistive, low-tool, or cold-reader use shows that another front reaches the first relevant body and return at lower effort while preserving edition identity, truthful labels, navigation consistency, and the maintainer/public boundary. |
| When should the practical-entry set promote an ordinary entry to a selected card, and how much card apparatus is justified? | The best-known current FPF line is selection by demonstrated mnemonic gain: keep one non-exhaustive entry set, use the lighter five-field ordinary entry by default, add the six-field card only when the longer reminder improves recognition or return, and let each product declare one reading-burden measure and its own maxima. | Card-per-pattern fanout and the opposite no-card rule are the serious defaults. The first turns a navigation aid into a rival catalogue and fixed quota; the second withholds a useful longer reminder even when cross-pattern choice repeatedly fails. | Both defaults ignore the actual reader decision. **Adapt:** section 4.3 and `CC-PFP.9a–c` preserve one entry set, an explicit examples-not-coverage statement, stable field order, one same-key expansion, product-language limits, and zero-card permission. **Reject:** universal card counts, copied FPF numeric limits, syntax as proof of mnemonic gain, and a second card front door. | `E.11` supplies the selected mnemonic-gain rule; the current FPF examples, LPF compact locator, and direct-answer DPF Suite Reference are comparison and counterexample evidence. They show that a useful direct entry need not become a card and that a framework may legitimately declare zero cards. No external source, current edition, or local example validates a universal quota or reading measure. | Reopen the smallest affected entry form or check if actual product-language or cold-reader comparison of the same content with and without the card changes its classification, exposes a missing visible field, or shows that the declared burden guard prevents reliable choice and return. |

Source identity, publication date, maintenance state, and currentness remain in their evidence or refresh records. A newer, official, or more widely used source does not raise either comparison unless its substantive answer defeats the selected line and changes one of the governed loci above.

### E.11.PFP:12 - Relations

- **Specializes:** `E.11` for the common reader-facing form of one FPF, DPF, or LPF edition; `E.11` retains practical-use discoverability and first-result routing.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4`, `E.4.FPF`, and `E.4.DPF` for framework/product boundary, product-specific publication units, optional reader cues, body order, and carrier assembly.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.24.PUB` for publication occurrence, selected edition, form expression, carrier bearing, audience, bounded use, availability, and access; and `E.17` for bounded publication projections and source return.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.PFR` for exact dependency and edition relations, `G.11` for currentness and refresh, `E.4.DPF.DA` and `E.2.DA` for applicable package or whole-FPF adequacy, and `E.21` for pattern quality.
- **Does not replace:** product-specific builders or validators, the edition record, `FPFEditionRebuildabilityRecord`, `FrameworkPackageManifest`, an architecture decision, or a public product boundary.
