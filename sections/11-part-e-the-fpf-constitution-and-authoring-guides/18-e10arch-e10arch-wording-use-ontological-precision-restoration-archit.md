## E.10.ARCH - Wording-Use Ontological Precision Restoration Architecture

> **Type:** Architectural (E)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

**Plain-name.** Wording ontology repair architecture.

**Intent.**
Keep FPF wording-use precision restoration distributed without letting every pattern of concern or subject pattern grow its own first-stage wording-recognition table. `E.10` recognizes overloaded wording use; `E.10.ARCH` says which applicability rows exist, how one row selects the first applicable restoration or governing pattern, and when repeated repair-only prose should be extracted from a subject pattern.

`E.10.ARCH` is not a generic language-cleanup pattern. Its mechanism is ontological reconstruction: recover what kind of thing is being talked about, which adjacent EntityOfConcern values, relation records, claim records, slot or use-position values, and FPF kinds named by value or references are admissibly involved, which relation, source-use disposition, or state-family value is current, and, when plain ontology is not enough, which mathematical lens under `C.29` or which pattern-defined formal apparatus makes the candidate structure checkable. The output returns to wording only after that kind, slot or use-position, and use structure is recoverable. When the kind is recoverable but phrase-level apparatus still hides it, use `F.19` for ontology-first plain technical rewriting.

**Builds on.** `E.10`, `A.6.P`, `A.6.F`, `C.2.P`, `C.2.P.DR`, `C.30.STRAT`, `A.19.SPR`, `A.6.3.CSC`, `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.6.0`, `A.6.1`, `E.20`, `E.24`, `E.24.CD`, `E.24.PUB`, `F.18`, `E.8`, `E.19`, and `E.2`.

**Coordinates with.** `A.22`, `C.30`, `C.30.P`, `C.30.STRAT`, `C.30.ASV`, named `C.30.*` structure or view patterns, `C.16`, `A.17`, `A.18`, `A.19`, `C.25`, `C.27.TA`, `C.27`, `C.29`, `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.3.3`, `A.3.4`, `A.6.0`, `A.6.1`, `E.18`, `E.20`, `E.24`, `E.24.CD`, `E.24.PUB`, `A.15.2`, `A.15.1`, `A.10`, `F.19`, `E.21`, `E.11`, `I.2`, and evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, causal-use, release, and publication patterns governing those claims when those claims are being made.

### E.10.ARCH:0 - Use this when

Use this pattern when a recurring FPF-governed wording-use problem cannot be closed by one local `E.10` rewrite because the wording hides a stable primary-EntityOfConcern use field set, a stable recovery apparatus, and a useful remaining reader move.

Use it especially when a subject or adequacy pattern contains repeated first-stage repair prose such as:

- architecture-vs-diagram, model, graph, ADR, dashboard, view, layer, level, tier, stack, block, expert, cache, router, or gate triage before the architecture, structure, control, module-interface, flow, scale, publication, or gate pattern can start;
- axis, dimension, feature, property, metric, indicator, score, strong, weak, robust, level, coordinate, threshold, or scalar-quality triage before a characteristic or scale pattern can start;
- quality-term repair that decides between relation construction, quality characterization, evaluative characterization, Q-bundle use, pattern-quality coordinate use, action invitation, bridge, or governing pattern;
- state-family wording such as state, status, posture, readiness, stance, or currentness before the bearer, state frame, value set, admissible use, or governing pattern is recovered;
- admissibility-like, legal, lawful, authority, validity, readiness, pass-looking, fail-looking, or conformance wording before bearer, claim kind, source relation, value frame, bounded use, and direct governing pattern are recovered;
- method, algorithm, program, proof, solver, workflow, process, procedure, access path, query plan, control strategy, or programming-paradigm wording before its slot or use-position is recovered as method, method description, formal substrate, mathematical-lens use, mechanism, work plan, dated work, evidence relation, or quote-only source wording;
- graph, path, query, table, dashboard, checklist predicate, publication face, evidence path, or pattern-relation wording overread as a route, call, dispatch, invocation, work sequence, permission, release, evidence result, or pattern application;
- source, publication, publication form, face, `PublicationUnit`, dashboard, documentation, or source-return wording whose project-side use is not yet recovered;
- relation-like, function-like, evidence-like, assurance-like, gate-like, work-like, decision-like, causal-use, release, or naming wording whose governing pattern is already known or must be recovered before the sentence is admitted.

**What goes wrong if missed.** FPF accumulates many small local wording-recognition lists. One pattern says "architecture is not a diagram", another says "metric is not proof", another says "quality is not one scalar", another says "a path is not a route", and a reviewer cannot tell which pattern carries the repair. The text looks more precise, but the reader does not get a stable first move.

**What this buys.** `E.10.ARCH` gives one architecture for distributing wording-use repair: `E.10` recognizes the wording-use row; `E.10.ARCH` selects the row and extraction criterion; a realization pattern or governing neighboring pattern recovers the ontology; the subject pattern returns to its own primary `EntityOfConcern` and first useful move.

**First useful move.** Decide whether the wording can close locally under `E.10`, already has a governing pattern, or needs one applicability row with stable `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, `ontologicalNeighborhood`, recovery apparatus, and remaining reader move.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If a sentence is repaired locally under `E.10`, stop there.
- If the governing pattern and primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, or claim record are already recoverable by value, use that governing pattern directly.
- If the kind under repair is evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, causal-use, release, mathematical-lens use, grounded architecture adequacy, structural-view adequacy, characteristic-space construction, Q-bundle construction, pattern-quality evaluation, method, mechanism, method description, formal substrate, graph path, evidence path, publication face, or another FPF kind named by value, the governing pattern governs its own invariant. `E.10.ARCH` only governs the wording-use restoration distribution.
- If the wording problem is phrase-level apparatus around an already recoverable kind, use `F.19` rather than creating a new wording-use restoration row.

### E.10.ARCH:1 - Primary EntityOfConcern and applicability-row scope

The primary `EntityOfConcern` for this pattern use is the local FPF architecture of `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityRow` rows.

A `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityRow` is a pattern-local row over one `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, one `semanticArea`, one `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, one recurring `entityOfConcernUseFields` field set, and one `ontologicalNeighborhood`. It states:

- the trigger source recognized by `E.10`;
- `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, and `semanticAreaSenseFamily`;
- the primary `EntityOfConcern` kind and encountered FPF kind or reference;
- the relation between the encountered FPF kind or reference and the primary `EntityOfConcern`;
- the FPF kind or relation named by value recovered when current;
- current-claim or admissible-use classification when current;
- source-use disposition when current;
- state-family value or governing-pattern result when current;
- sentence role;
- admissible use;
- non-use boundary;
- remaining reader move;
- first applicable restoration or governing pattern;
- recovery product;
- first return to the subject pattern.

`WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityRow` is not a `U.*` kind, not a conformance record, not a process task, not a deontic obligation, and not a durable project record by itself.

`WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityTable` is the pattern-local publication table of such rows. It is not a pattern cluster, workstream, campaign, module, semantic parent, or authority-bearing record.

`semanticAreaBaseConcept` is the Base concept, source-side phrase, or already settled row cue by which the reader first recognizes the candidate semantic unit.

`semanticArea` is the Part-F semantic unit used by one wording-use restoration row: one Concept-Set row, one UTS row, or an explicitly bounded row-set whose rows remain sense-uniform enough for one recovery apparatus.

`semanticAreaSenseFamily` is the Part-F `senseFamily` or FPF kind named by value-family discriminator that prevents the row from becoming a theme, domain, workstream, or pattern-nest label.

`ontologicalNeighborhood` means the FPF applicability neighborhood around that named `semanticArea`: primary `EntityOfConcern` kind, admissible adjacent FPF kinds or references, relations, descriptions, publication forms or carriers, source-use dispositions, state-family values, use boundaries, applicable FPF patterns, remaining reader move, and the stable apparatus that makes the recovery checkable. It is not the semantic unit by itself and is not textual proximity, filename proximity, ToC proximity, alphabetic proximity, workstream grouping, topic grouping, discipline column, domain label, or pattern-nest placement.

`pattern nest` means a numbering or placement grouping such as `A.6.*`, `C.16.*`, or `C.30.*`. One applicability row may point to a realization pattern in one pattern nest, but the row and the nest are not the same concept.

### E.10.ARCH:2 - Distribution architecture

The standing construction is:

1. `E.10` recognizes an FPF-governed wording use and either closes it locally or selects a governing pattern, controlled precision-reduction pattern, durable-name application, or fail-closed non-use disposition.
2. `E.10.ARCH` maintains the shared recovery algorithm and the `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityTable`.
3. A realization pattern or retained governing pattern such as `A.6.P`, `A.6.F`, `C.2.P`, `C.2.P.DR`, `C.30.P`, `C.30.STRAT`, `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, `A.19.SPR`, `A.3.1`, or a direct evidence, graph, method, mechanism, work, gate, authority, release, or publication-use governing pattern unpacks the wording according to the shared algorithm for one named `semanticArea` and its `ontologicalNeighborhood`.
4. Additional applicability rows, and only when needed additional realization patterns, appear when repeated FPF-governed wording hides a stable primary-EntityOfConcern use field set, a stable recovery apparatus, and a useful remaining reader move that no existing governing pattern already carries.
5. `E.8` governs publication-form and placement wording such as `pattern nest`, and requires authoring prose that uses `ontologicalNeighborhood` to expose the governing `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, and `semanticAreaSenseFamily` rather than treating neighborhood as the semantic unit.
6. `E.19` checks that authored pattern hosts preserve this distribution and do not keep rival first-stage repair doctrine.

This architecture keeps `E.10` compact. It also keeps subject patterns centered on their own primary EntityOfConcern values, decisions, characteristics, structures, mathematical lenses, consequences, and worked uses.

#### E.10.ARCH:2.1 - EntityOfConcern and recurring hidden-field distribution

For wording such as `EntityOfInterest`, `EoI`, `EoIClass`, `describedEntity`, `DescribedEntityRef`, and `primary described entity`, or for selected EntityOfConcern-family heads such as `EntityOfConcern`, `entityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernClass`, and `publicationUnitPrimaryEntityOfConcern`, the repair is distributed by the current FPF-governed use:

`EntityOfInterest`, `EoI`, `EoIClass`, `describedEntity`, `DescribedEntityRef`, and `primary described entity` are active repair triggers. FPF-governed wording must recover the EntityOfConcern-family use named by value, publication-unit primary-EoC use, or local FPF kind, then rewrite to `EntityOfConcern`, `entityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernClass`, `publicationUnitPrimaryEntityOfConcern`, or the local FPF kind named by value. If no use is recoverable by value, the wording remains quoted source or trigger wording and cannot be used for reliance.

- `C.2.1` carries the selected episteme slot and reference ontology: `EntityOfConcernSlot`, `entityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernRef`, `EntityOfConcernChangeMode`, and `EntityOfConcernClass`.
- `C.2.P` carries episteme, publication, and source-use precision restoration when the sentence still hides source wording, claim-bearing episteme, publication or publication-form construction, project-side reliance, pattern-application wording, or use or non-use disposition.
- `F.18` carries durable naming, selected head settlement, and source-string and durable-name discipline after the kind under repair and use are recovered.
- `E.17.AUD.OOTD` carries `publicationUnitPrimaryEntityOfConcern` for one bounded publication unit with one carried move and one outside-work boundary; it must not create a second C.2.1 slot.
- `A.6.3`, its retained `entityOfConcernRef`-preserving specializations, and `A.6.4` carry preservation or retargeting of the EntityOfConcern across episteme morphisms.
- Evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, architecture, characteristic, mathematical-lens, or project-side patterns receive their own claim being made or admissible-use boundary directly when it is already recoverable.

This selected-family case is the standing example for recurring hidden-field architecture. When a new hidden-field family recurs, it is not solved by adding local warning prose to every subject pattern. It either uses an existing governing pattern, gets one applicability row in this table, or justifies a new realization pattern only when the hidden field set, recovery apparatus, and remaining reader move recur across FPF-governed texts.

#### E.10.ARCH:2.2 - Ontic-Level and Facet-Level Restoration Distribution

Use this distribution before adding or specializing a wording-use precision-restoration pattern.

`E.10` is the shared recognition scan. It recognizes an FPF-governed wording-use problem and selects the first applicable restoration or governing pattern. `E.10.ARCH` owns the distribution rule. A specialized restoration pattern owns only the stable ontological recovery for one selected ontic, semantic area, or high-pressure facet.

Use a direct governing pattern when the current kind, relation, claim, slot, or use-position is already recoverable by value. A direct `A.3.4`, `A.6.F`, `C.29`, `E.18`, `C.30`, `A.15`, `A.10`, gate, decision, publication, or evidence use does not need a restoration detour only because a familiar trigger word appears.

Use an ontic-level restoration pattern only when recurring wording hides a small ontic or ontic-neighborhood: several linked slots, adjacent governed fillers, and admissible neighboring patterns must be recovered before ordinary wording repair is possible. The pattern should recover the ontic, its current slot or filler, and the governing pattern that applies to the recovered value; it should not become a second copy of every slot-specific repair table.

Use `E.24.CD` only when the recurring wording may need an ontic candidate decision: the material clusters around one EntityOfConcern family, reusable slot relation, stable semantic area, ontological neighborhood, and action-facing gain that no direct governing pattern already carries. Use `E.24.PUB` only when the repair must distinguish ontic, ontic-description episteme, publication form, view, record, card, table, schema, data-structure expression, rendering, or source relation. If the subject ontology is already governed by a pattern such as `A.22`, `A.19`, `C.30`, `A.3.4`, or `C.2.1`, use that pattern directly and cite `E.24.CD` or `E.24.PUB` only as the relevant thin boundary reference.

Use a facet or slot-neighborhood restoration pattern
 only when one recurring facet cuts across several ontics or subject patterns and has its own stable ambiguity. Function-like wording under `A.6.F` is the standing example: function wording may point to transformation behavior, transformer-side bearer material, mathematical function, module allocation, capability, quality, role, work, method, evidence, assurance, gate, or decision. That facet is too broad to duplicate inside every ontic-level restoration pattern and too specific to leave as ordinary prose.

Do not create one precision-restoration pattern per slot. A slot gets a separate restoration pattern only when the same slot-neighborhood ambiguity recurs across several patterns, changes the governing FPF kind or relation, and would otherwise force subject patterns to carry repeated first-stage repair prose. Otherwise, keep the slot inside the governing ontic pattern or apply the direct governing pattern for the filled value.

When both an ontic-level restoration pattern and a facet restoration pattern are applicable, apply them by recovered question, not by word order. The ontic-level pattern asks which ontic, slot, filler, and neighboring governing pattern are current. The facet pattern asks how the overloaded facet word is assigned after that recovery. For example, transformation wording that includes `function`, `functional`, or `functioning` may use a transformation-ontic restoration pattern to recover `U.Transformation`, `TransformationFlowStructure`, transformer-side filler, input boundary, output boundary, or `FunctioningRef?`; detailed function-kind discrimination remains with `A.6.F`.

A conforming specialized restoration pattern states:

- the ontic, semantic area, or facet-neighborhood under repair;
- the recognition wording family selected by `E.10`;
- the recovered kind, slot or use-position, filler, relation, and governing pattern;
- any direct governing pattern that should apply instead when the value is already recoverable;
- any facet restoration pattern that owns a narrower recurring ambiguity;
- the temporary recovery product and the retained user-facing move after wording repair.

### E.10.ARCH:2a - Rationale and source-use lines

This distribution is selected because the recurring failure is not "too few word rules". The failure is that repair-only trigger prose migrates into subject patterns and begins to compete with their primary `EntityOfConcern` and first useful moves. A common symptom is a non-semio pattern whose Solution mainly teaches that a description, view, publication, record, card, diagram, source, or file is not a permission, promise, prescription, evidence record, assurance verdict, decision, gate passage, release, work occurrence, or authority source. Those guards are often correct, but their ontology is publication pragmatics, description pragmatics, and neighboring-pattern assignment, not the subject matter of the architecture, method, role, evidence, or characterization pattern. A workable FPF answer therefore needs three separations at once: a cheap shared trigger scan in `E.10`, a shared recovery architecture in `E.10.ARCH`, and local realization only where a named `semanticArea` has stable row identity, a stable field set, an `ontologicalNeighborhood`, and a remaining reader move.

| Source or practice line | Source-use role | What the line changes in `E.10.ARCH` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current FPF distribution: `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `A.6.P`, `A.6.F`, `C.2.P`, `C.30.P`, `C.30.STRAT`, `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, `A.19.SPR`, `F.18`, `E.8`, `E.19`, `E.11`, and `I.2`. | Current FPF-internal architecture source line for the selected distribution. | Keeps `E.10` compact, puts the shared recovery algorithm in `E.10.ARCH`, assigns relation, source-use, architecture, stratification-source-label, characteristic, quality, state-family, function-like, naming, entry-distribution, and expanded entry-disambiguation cases to realization or governing patterns named by value, and gives `E.19` a distribution-preservation check. |
| Pattern-language locality and FPF primary-EntityOfConcern discipline in `E.8` and `E.19`. | Current FPF authoring and review source line; not an external standard imported as ontology. | Forces thin governing-pattern pointers and blocks local wording-recognition-table copies inside patterns of concern whose real work is architecture, structure, characteristic, quality, evidence, gate, work, decision, state-family precision, or release. |
| Terminology and controlled-vocabulary practice named in `E.10:11a` only where it concerns designations, labels, discoverability, and controlled vocabulary publication. | Current-standard and reference-use source line; it does not define FPF kind ontology. | Provides explicit recovered heads and reusable-name discipline, but rejects a central word list or controlled vocabulary as the solution to every wording-use repair. |
| Current governing-pattern growth in FPF. | Reopen pressure, not proof of this pattern's authority. | Requires a row to be removed, narrowed, or changed when a new governing pattern can carry the EntityOfConcern under repair, relation, claim, or local field directly, or when realization patterns start copying the shared algorithm back into local prose. |

The selected architecture is lowered or reopened when one of those source lines changes: if `E.10` can close the issue locally, if a new governing pattern removes the need for a restoration row, if a realization pattern needs a different stable field set, or if subject patterns again start carrying duplicated first-stage trigger registries.

### E.10.ARCH:3 - Shared recovery algorithm

#### E.10.ARCH:3.1 - Method, work, and P2W governing-pattern constellation in wording restoration

Use this branch when one source label, project handle, or project concern points to changing, producing, selecting, deriving, controlling, or maintaining an `EntityOfConcern` rather than to one typed FPF value.

Do not name a new recovery object. Recover the project concern first only to find the linked relation positions. Then recover the typed FPF values separately through their governing patterns. Typical filled values include `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.Mechanism`, formal-substrate declaration, mathematical-lens use, `U.WorkPlan`, dated `U.Work`, evidence relation, source relation, gate relation, result relation, publication relation, and temporal relation when current.

This branch is an `E.10.ARCH` use of existing subject ontology and relation and slot discipline. It is not `U.ChangeConcern`, not `MethodWorkChangeOnticGraph`, not a process model, not a workflow, and not a super-kind over method, mechanism, plan, work, evidence, source, gate, result, or temporal values.

A compact local restoration note may record the affected entity, bounded context, change or maintained-condition statement, state or delta predicates when current, and references to the separately recovered typed values. That note is not a project record, evidence record, gate record, method, mechanism, work plan, work occurrence, or ontic. It is only the local record of how the wording restoration found the governing typed values.

Each filled reference remains governed by its own pattern. `A.15` carries the role-method-plan-work alignment part; `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.6.0`, `C.29`, `A.6.1`, `E.20`, `A.10`, gate, source, result, publication, temporal, and evidence patterns carry their own typed values. Do not assign one typed value as both `U.Method` and `U.Mechanism` unless a governing pattern explicitly admits that dual typing. Slot-position labels do not create alternate ontology.

If a current `U.*` name in the constellation looks like only a slot-position label, apply `E.24`: retain the `U.*` name only when an existing governing pattern gives it standalone `EntityOfConcern` identity, stable identity criterion, and action-facing gain. If not, demote that use to a SlotKind or relation label rather than keeping the U-kind by inertia. If repeated method, work, and process material actually needs a durable ontic, open an E.24 ontic-introduction decision and write the governing head pattern before citing that ontic as current FPF ontology.
Use this recovery order for FPF-relevant wording-use restoration cases. Each realization pattern may publish a compact local form, but the order stays shared.

1. **Trigger and bounded text.** Name the bounded text span or publication unit, trigger span, local sentence role, register classification, and whether the text is conformant FPF, project text deliberately using FPF-governed terms, pattern references, relation names, or conformance claims, or source text being unpacked for possible FPF use.
2. **Cheap local closure.** Check whether the wording has no FPF-governed use or only a small local head, register, or morphology repair. If yes, repair locally under `E.10`, state the remaining reader move, and stop.
3. **Head kind and candidate ontology.** Recover the head kind, register classification, EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary, specification-use gate when specification use is current, candidate referents, candidate EntityOfConcern values, relation records named by value, claim records, candidate relations, candidate slots or use-positions, candidate carriers or publications, and scope, time, viewpoint, or context facets. Include literal and intended candidates when metonymy or compression is plausible.
4. **Semantic area, ontological neighborhood, and governing-pattern selection.** State `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, and `semanticAreaSenseFamily`; then select the `ontologicalNeighborhood` and first applicable governing pattern by primary `EntityOfConcern` kind and admissible adjacent FPF kinds, references, or relations: relation construction, function-like kind and relation recovery, episteme, publication, source-use, selected structure or architecture description, characteristic or scale construction, quality characterization, evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, causal-use, naming, controlled coarsening, or another governing FPF pattern.
5. **Formal apparatus or stable substrate.** State the stable apparatus that makes the repair checkable: relation or signature slots under `A.6.0`, `A.6.5`, and `A.6.P`; publication relation set; source-use disposition; selected structure; architecture question; characteristic or scale construction; quality bundle; mathematical lens under `C.29`; evidence path; gate record; work occurrence; decision record; assurance argument; causal-use record; or governing-pattern field set. When the same object is used in several relation, signature, or lens positions, record the object kind and slot or use-position separately and cite the governing pattern; `E.10.ARCH` selects the restoration architecture rather than duplicating that pattern's ontology.
6. **Normalized ontology and lexical projection.** Produce the repaired wording, compact repair note, record-shaped value, governing-pattern application, or non-use disposition. Do not replace one umbrella word with another. The replacement candidate is itself a bounded wording use until it passes the `E.10` trigger scan or is demoted to ordinary wording, quote-only wording, reduced-use cue, blocked use, or incomplete rewrite.
7. **Admissible use and remaining reader move.** State the admissible use, non-admissible claim escalation or adjacent use, and one useful reader move. If the wording is type-correct but inert, the repair is incomplete.

Perform a terminology-source audit only when the wording imports a source ontology that can change the recovered object, kind, relation, slot or use-position, admissible use, or governing pattern. For slot-shaped material, use `E.24` slot-language unless a governing boundary or interface pattern makes interface meaning current. Do not turn stable ordinary prose into type annotation merely because the repair can name its ontology.

The sequence is shared; each wording-use restoration case differs by `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, primary `EntityOfConcern` use fields, slot or use-position field set, `ontologicalNeighborhood`, governing pattern, substrate, and result.

| Method, algorithm, program, solver, proof, recipe, workflow, process, procedure, access path, query plan, control strategy, or programming-paradigm wording; primary recoverable use is a slot or use-position in the method-description-work-mechanism chain | `A.3.1` first when method-like wording hides the slot; direct governing pattern after recovery; `C.2.P.DR` first when representation overread is the current problem | algorithm, program, solver, proof, recipe, method, workflow, process, procedure, access path, query plan, control strategy, imperative, functional, logical, constraint, object-centric event, effect-handler, pipeline, orchestration, or similar wording. | current slot or use-position: context-local semantic way of doing (`A.3.1`), episteme describing a method (`A.3.2`), formal-substrate declaration (`A.6.0`) and mathematical-lens use (`C.29`) when current, mechanism declaration or realization governed by `A.6.1` and `E.20`, planned work (`A.15.2`), dated work (`A.15.1`), evidence relation (`A.10`), source relation, gate relation, result relation, direct governing pattern, or quote-only source wording.

Do not assign the same typed value as both `U.Method` and `U.Mechanism` unless a governing pattern explicitly admits such dual typing.

### E.10.ARCH:5 - Direct known governing-pattern rule

If the governing pattern and its primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, claim record, slot, or use-position are already recoverable by value, use that governing pattern directly. Do not send direct `C.30`, `C.16`, `C.29`, `E.21`, `E.18`, `A.10`, `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.6.0`, `A.6.1`, `E.20`, evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, causal-use, release, naming, controlled-coarsening, action-invitation, `A.6.M` module-interface, publication-face, or mathematical-lens cases through a restoration pattern only because a familiar trigger word appears.

Apply `A.6.P`, `A.6.F`, `C.2.P`, `C.2.P.DR`, `C.30.P`, `C.30.STRAT`, `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, `A.19.SPR`, or `A.3.1` only when wording hides the EntityOfConcern under repair, relation, characteristic, scale, score, quality characterization, comparison reference set, source-use disposition, state-family value, method-like slot, declarative-representation use, admissible use, or remaining reader move.

### E.10.ARCH:6 - Admission and extraction criterion

Add or retain a `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityRow` when all of the following are true:

- the wording recurs across FPF-governed texts or project text deliberately using FPF-governed terms, pattern references, relation names, or conformance claims;
- the hidden primary-EntityOfConcern use field set is stable;
- the recovery apparatus or field set is stable enough to teach;
- repeated in-place repair distracts from the subject pattern's primary EntityOfConcern and first useful move;
- a useful remaining reader move survives after overread removal;
- no existing governing pattern already carries the row without duplicating repair-only doctrine inside subject patterns.

Do not add a new realization pattern when an existing governing pattern such as `A.6.F`, `A.6.A`, `A.6.M`, `A.15.4`, `A.6.6`, `A.6.3.CSC`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `A.15`, `C.11`, `C.28`, or another governing pattern already carries the EntityOfConcern under repair, relation, claim, or field. Record that pattern as the `governingPattern`.

Extract repair-only material from a subject pattern when the material is only wording-recognition lists, false-friend rows, anti-umbrella prose, or repair fields that must run before the subject pattern can start. Leave a narrow first-use cue or governing-pattern relation in the subject pattern.

Keep material in the subject pattern when it states the subject pattern's own invariant, worked case, conformance condition, characteristic construction, structural construction, mathematical lens, source-return condition, or user action.

### E.10.ARCH:7 - Subject-pattern thin-pointer rule

Subject patterns keep at most one local first-use cue when the EntityOfConcern under repair, relation, claim, or field is hidden, then name the selected precision-restoration pattern as a pattern through ordinary reference apparatus or `Relations`. They do not turn that reference into local reference boilerplate, and they do not copy:

- the full `E.10` wording-recognition table;
- this shared algorithm;
- the `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityTable`;
- broad false-friend lists whose only job is first-stage repair;
- old migration history written in place of current architecture prose.

A thin pointer is acceptable when it helps the working reader choose the right first move, for example:

- use `C.30.P` when architecture or structure wording hides whether the use under repair is selected structure, architecture-description use, structural-view use, source, model, diagram, graph, dashboard, or ordinary prose;
- use `C.30.STRAT` when `layer`, `level`, `tier`, `stack`, `ladder`, `rung`, `block`, `expert`, `cache`, `router`, `gate`, or a close source label hides whether the use under repair is a control-layer relation, module-interface relation, architecture-to-`TransformationFlowStructure` relation, scale or coarse-graining relation, publication relation set, gate relation, neighboring use named by value, ordinary source label, quote-only cue, or blocked use;
- use `C.16.P` when metric, score, axis, dimension, feature, property, indicator, strong, weak, robust, level, coordinate, threshold, or comparison wording hides characteristic or scale construction;
- use `C.16.Q` when quality or evaluative characterization wording hides Q-bundle, pattern-quality coordinate, relation construction, action-invitation, bridge, or characterization use named by value;
- use `A.19.SPR` when state, status, posture, readiness, stance, currentness, or a local state-like field hides bearer, state frame, value set, admissible use, or governing pattern;
- use `C.2.P` when source, publication, publication form, face, `PublicationUnit`, dashboard, documentation, or text-work wording hides source-currentness relation or project-side reliance;
- use `A.3.1` when method, algorithm, program, proof, solver, workflow, process, procedure, access-path, query-plan, control-strategy, or programming-paradigm wording hides whether the current slot is method, method description, formal substrate, mathematical-lens use, mechanism, work plan, dated work, evidence relation, or quote-only source wording;
- use `C.2.P.DR` when a declarative representation, graph relation, evidence path, publication face, checklist predicate, query, dashboard, or pattern relation is being overread as an imperative route, call, dispatch, work sequence, permission, release, evidence result, or pattern application;
- use the direct governing pattern, with `A.19.SPR` only when hidden state-family wording remains, when admissibility-like, legal, lawful, validity, pass-looking, fail-looking, readiness, conformance, or authority wording already recovers its bearer, claim kind, source relation, value frame, and admissible use.

### E.10.ARCH:8 - Name and placement discipline

`semanticArea` is the selected Part-F Tech term for the semantic unit used by a wording-use restoration row. Plain speech may say "semantic area" or "meaning area" only as a gloss for that declared Part-F row or bounded row-set.

`meaning area`, `theme`, `pattern area`, `pattern cluster`, `workstream`, `campaign`, `module`, and `branch` are not selected as Tech architecture terms for this distribution. Tech prose must resolve those cues into `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, `entityOfConcernUseFields`, `ontologicalNeighborhood`, `governingPattern` named by value, and realization pattern.

`pattern nest` is allowed for ID and placement grouping such as `A.6.*`, `C.16.*`, or `C.30.*`. It is not a semantic parent relation and not an authority relation.

`SelectedLocusObligationClosure` is the current `E.9.DA` coordinate name for selected-locus obligation closure. Do not reintroduce `ReceivingLocusObligationClosure` as a general obligation kind, locus kind, pattern role, or restoration vocabulary.

### E.10.ARCH:9 - Examples and near misses

| Wording | Applicable result | Blocked overread |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "The architecture is the diagram." | `C.30.P` recovers whether the diagram is publication form, structure view, architecture description, source relation, or ordinary source cue; then `C.30` or `C.30.ASV` applies only after the selected architecture or structural-view use is recovered. | diagram-as-architecture; diagram-as-proof; diagram-as-gate. |
| "`ArchitectureOf@PlantOps` is defined over structures S1 and S2 under context C." | Direct `C.30`; no `C.30.P` unless selected structure, architecture-description use, structural-view use, source use, model use, diagram use, graph use, dashboard use, or ordinary prose remains hidden. | unnecessary restoration detour. |
| "The model has three layers." | `C.30.STRAT` treats `layers` as a source label until the recovered FPF kind, relation, claim-use, or source-use disposition is recovered: control-layer relation, neural-network block sequence, publication relation set, mathematical scale or coarse-graining relation, or ordinary source wording. Then the governing pattern applies to the recovered result. | layer-as-universal-kind; source label as proof of structure. |
| "The query plan calls the next pattern." | `C.2.P.DR` recovers whether the query plan is a representation, method description, formal substrate, evidence or provenance relation, or ordinary source wording; if a pattern relation is current, the relation is stated declaratively rather than as a call. | query-as-work sequence; pattern relation as invocation. |
| "The evidence path authorizes release." | If a provenance relation for a claim is current, use `A.10`; if authorization or release is current, use the authority, gate, or release pattern. `C.2.P.DR` applies only when `path` wording turns the relation into an action route or permission. | evidence path as permission; graph relation as release. |
| "The solver algorithm is the mechanism." | `A.3.1` first recovers whether the current slot is method, method description, formal substrate, mathematical-lens use, mechanism declaration or realization, work, evidence, or quote-only wording. Use `A.6.1` and `E.20` only when operation algebra, laws, admissibility predicates, transport, audit, or governing-definition assignment is current. | algorithm-as-default-method; method-as-mechanism by vocabulary. |
| "This record is admissible." | Recover bearer, claim kind, source relation, value frame, admissible use, and governing pattern. Use `A.19.SPR` only if hidden state-family wording remains; otherwise use the direct evidence, gate, mechanism, temporal, authority, release, or source-use pattern. | admissible-as-generic status; pass-looking word as gate. |
| "This score proves readiness." | `C.16.P` recovers characteristic, scale, value, score, threshold, comparison reference set, and gate, evidence, and decision pattern applications. | score-as-proof; score-as-release permission. |
| "This source supports the claim." | `C.2.P` is used if source-currentness relation or publication relation set is current; relation slice applies `A.6.P`; final use states recovered relation or non-use disposition. | source-as-proof; support-as-generic relation. |
| "Quality improved." | `C.16.Q` recovers quality characterization or evaluative characterization, or names the `C.16.P`, `C.25`, `E.21`, `A.6.P`, action, work, or bridge pattern application governing the recovered claim. | quality-as-one scalar; quality-as-gate. |
| "The function improved maintainability." | `A.6.F` first recovers the FPF kind named by value, relation, or claim when hidden; quality or maintainability wording is then governed by `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, `C.25`, or the quality pattern governing the current claim. | function-as-default-architecture; maintainability-as-unscaled verdict. |
| "Read this pattern for improvement proposals." | Recover whether the current FPF-governed use is source-publication use, bounded comparative review unit, or improvement-oriented evaluation. Use `E.22` only for improvement-oriented quality review under a declared pattern-under-improvement evaluation. | generic reading as a pattern. |
| "This summary is enough for action." | `E.10` checks whether the wording is precision restoration or controlled precision reduction. If coarsened source-to-rendering use is current, `A.6.3.CSC` names source-bearing side, loss mode, narrower admissible use, non-admissible downstream use, and reopen condition. | summary-as-full source; coarsening without declared loss. |

### E.10.ARCH:10 - Conformance checklist

| Check | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-E10ARCH-1` | `E.10` remains the compact trigger-and-applicability pattern; `E.10.ARCH` carries the shared algorithm and applicability-row architecture. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-2` | Each `WordingUseRestorationApplicabilityRow` names `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, primary EntityOfConcern kind and use fields, `ontologicalNeighborhood`, first applicable restoration or governing pattern, recovery product, non-use boundary, and remaining reader move. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-3` | Direct known governing-pattern cases use the governing pattern directly instead of creating a restoration detour. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-4` | A new realization pattern is added only when no existing governing pattern carries the stable recovery apparatus without duplicating repair-only doctrine inside subject patterns. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-5` | Subject patterns of concern keep their primary `EntityOfConcern` and first useful move central and carry only thin first-use cues to precision restoration when wording is hidden. Generic guards about description and publication use are kept in a named description and publication-use boundary section or description-publication pattern governing that use; they do not become the subject Solution. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6` | `reading`, `read`, and `quality-read` wording remains trigger wording and does not mint `ReadingPrecisionRestoration`. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6a` | EntityOfConcern-like hidden fields follow the selected distribution: `E.10` recognizes the wording-use row, `C.2.1` carries slot and reference ontology, `C.2.P` restores episteme, publication, and source-use wording, `F.18` settles durable heads and source-string decisions, `E.17.AUD.OOTD` carries publication-unit primary entity of concern, and governing patterns carry their own claim being made or admissible-use boundary. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6b` | State-family wording follows the selected distribution: `E.10` recognizes the wording-use row, `A.19.SPR` realizes recurring hidden bearer, state-frame, value, and use recovery, and governing patterns carry already-recovered evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, temporal, mathematical-lens, pattern-quality, source-use, or process cases directly. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6c` | Stratification and source-label wording follows the selected distribution: `E.10` recognizes the wording-use row, `C.30.STRAT` realizes recurring source-label repair, and governing patterns carry already-recovered control-layer, module-interface, architecture-to-`TransformationFlowStructure`, scale or coarse-graining, publication relation set, gate, work, decision, or ordinary non-use cases directly. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6d` | Admissibility-like, legal, lawful, validity, pass-looking, fail-looking, readiness, conformance, and authority wording does not mint a generic admissibility object. The repair recovers bearer, claim kind, source relation, value frame, admissible use, non-admissible overread, and the direct governing pattern; `A.19.SPR` is used only when hidden state-family wording remains. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6e` | Method-like and algorithm-like wording first recovers the project concern and then recovers separately governed typed values through the existing method, work, and P2W governing-pattern constellation. `A.3.1` governs the semantic way of doing, `A.3.2` governs descriptions of that way, `A.6.0` and `C.29` govern formal-substrate and mathematical-lens use, `A.6.1` and `E.20` govern mechanism meaning, and work, plan, evidence relation, source relation, gate relation, result relation, or quote-only cases go to their direct governing patterns. One source label may link several typed values, but no typed value is both `U.Method` and `U.Mechanism` unless a governing pattern explicitly admits dual typing. Slot-position labels do not create alternate ontology. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6f` | Declarative representation overread follows `C.2.P.DR` unless a direct graph, evidence, publication, method, work, gate, authority, or pattern-relation pattern already governs the recovered claim by value. Graph paths and evidence paths remain legitimate graph or provenance relations when that is the current claim; they become repair triggers only when read as routes, calls, dispatches, permissions, releases, work sequences, or evidence results by metaphor. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-6g` | Terminology-source audit is bounded: source-ontology labels are recovered when they affect object, kind, relation, slot or use-position, admissible use, or governing-pattern selection; otherwise stable ordinary prose stays ordinary. Slot-shaped material follows `E.24` slot-language, and `interface` is used only under a governing boundary or interface pattern. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-7` | `function`, `functional`, `functionality`, and `effect` wording keeps `A.6.F` as first unpacker when the FPF kind named by value, relation, claim record, view, or governing-pattern application is hidden and does not default to architecture. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-8` | `semanticArea`, `ontologicalNeighborhood`, and `pattern nest` follow `E.8` placement discipline: `semanticArea` is the Part-F semantic unit, `ontologicalNeighborhood` is its applicability neighborhood, and `pattern nest` is placement. None of them becomes workstream, campaign, module, or authority-bearing record. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-9` | Repair removes overread and preserves one useful admissible reader move. Type-correct but inert wording is not recovered by value. |
| `CC-E10ARCH-10` | Validation checks cover duplicate wording-recognition tables, stale quality-term-restoration links, broad `U.*` heads, shadow restoration apparatus, and entry or index drift. |

### E.10.ARCH:11 - Common anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Classification without repair | The text says "this belongs under `A.6.P`" or "this belongs under `C.2.P`" but leaves no recovered wording, record, source-use disposition, direct governing-pattern application, or blocker. | Apply the selected pattern or fail closed. |
| Trigger registry copying | `E.19`, `C.30.P`, `C.16.P`, `C.16.Q`, or a subject pattern copies the full `E.10` trigger list. | Keep one thin cue in the subject pattern of concern and cite `E.10` and `E.10.ARCH` through ordinary reference apparatus or `Relations`. |
| Umbrella-to-umbrella replacement | `support` becomes `basis`, `surface` becomes `view`, `reading` becomes `evaluation`, or `function` becomes `role` without recovered kind and use. | Recover kind, relation, apparatus, admissible use, and remaining reader move; otherwise demote or block. |
| Source-ontology smuggling | `interface`, `schema`, `record`, `profile`, `path`, or another familiar source-domain word is used because it sounds precise, but the recovered slot, relation, boundary, or object kind is different. | Recover the source ontology and the FPF slot or use-position first; keep the source word only when its governing pattern makes that meaning current. |
| Over-annotated restoration | A clear subject sentence is expanded into type labels or source-ontology commentary even though no object, kind, relation, slot, admissible use, or governing pattern changes. | Keep the ordinary wording; annotate only the claim-governing term under repair and use `F.19` if phrase apparatus remains. |
| Sterile precision | The wording is ontologically well-formed but no working reader can tell why the distinction matters or what move remains. | Restore the didactic or recognition function in admissible wording, or classify as reduced-use cue, quote-only, blocked use, or incomplete rewrite. |
| Shadow precision-restoration pattern | A subject pattern contains its own first-stage repair algorithm beside this distribution. | Extract repair-only material to the applicable realization pattern and leave a first-use cue. |
| Reference boilerplate in subject pattern | A subject pattern explains where the repair belongs, why the package was split, or what this text does not contain instead of stating the subject pattern's own repaired wording or first move. | Move architecture-placement rationale to `DRR` or architecture notes; replace routing prose with a normal pattern id, citation, or `Relations` row. |
| Apparatus-preserving paraphrase | A repair changes wording but keeps phrase-level apparatus around a recoverable kind. | Apply `F.19` first; return to `E.10.ARCH` only for remaining word, head, or use precision. |
| Legacy placement as pattern prose | Old placement or alias text explains history instead of current use. | Keep only migration or entry rows where needed; write current pattern prose in the selected placement. |
