## E.4.DPF - Domain Principle Framework Authoring and Publication-or-Access Carrier Assembly

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative.

### E.4.DPF:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when a group needs to create a domain principle framework or local practice framework grounded in FPF: for example a hydroponic-cucumber framework, a neural-network architecture framework, or a Codex-process framework.

Primary `EntityOfConcern`: the authoring method for a bounded FPF-grounded framework edition. The first useful output is whichever current relation closes the immediate authoring question: a pre-PFAD organization-design proposal, a settled PFAD architecture decision, a post-existence architecture-description use card, or a post-PFAD dependency description. The later authoring spine remains context, source basis, selected architecture, names, pattern drafts, relation and edition records, publication or access, quality, improvement, and currentness returns.

Default artifact contract for a request such as "make a DPF about this topic" separates developer and user carriers. In a campaign or repository setting, create a developer decision carrier such as `SUBSTANTIVE-DRR.md` or `DPF-DRR.md` governed by `E.9` and checked by `E.9.DA`; it carries the source basis, selected architecture, PFAD decision, candidate pattern split, relation plan, quality plan, and rejected alternatives. Create a user-facing framework publication or access carrier named by the individual framework, such as `<DomainOrPractice>-PRINCIPLES-FRAMEWORK.md`, `<PublicFrameworkName>.md`, a split readme, pattern, and appendix set, a skill pack, or an MCP-backed access service; it is the access route through which readers or agents use the DPF edition. Optional source-pack, PFR, quality-run, package-evaluation, skill-manifest, or access-service files may be separate when they need independent maintenance; process state remains outside the user carrier.

Use this pattern when the work creates a framework. Use `E.11` or `E.17` when the work only changes how existing material is exposed to readers.

Plain vocabulary for adoption:

| Public phrase | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `principle framework` | The general public phrase for an FPF-grounded framework of patterns, decisions, relation records, source basis, publication, quality, and refresh. |
| `Domain Principle Framework` | A principle framework for a domain such as greenhouse cucumbers, neural-network architecture, or safety certification practice. |
| `Local Practice Framework` | A principle framework for one organization, project, team, role context, or local operating practice. |
| `bounded context` | The domain or local situation where this framework's meanings hold. |
| `framework edition` | One versioned state of the framework with dependency, compatibility, publication, quality, and refresh records. |
| `framework publication carrier` | A reader-facing carrier for a framework edition: readme, preface, table of contents, pattern bodies, support maps, relation records, and refresh route as needed. |
| `framework access carrier` | A user-facing or agent-facing access carrier for a framework edition: all-in-one publication carrier, split document set, card set, skill pack, MCP-backed access service, retrieval route, or assistant integration. It exposes the selected framework edition; it does not define the framework architecture, source pack, quality result, runtime dependency, or work authority by itself. |
| `local monolith` | Workspace and editorial shorthand for one all-in-one framework publication carrier. Do not use it as the public framework name, and do not treat it as the framework architecture itself. |

Old intake labels such as `SPF`, `TPF`, or broad `xPF` remain source aliases until `F.18` settles a durable public name and any admissible short form. For the current FPF term set, `F.18` selects Tech name `FoundationalPrinciplePatternSet` with Plain name "foundational principle pattern set"; `ZPF` remains only its mnemonic alias, not a public "zero principles" framework name. If the alias suggests a different framework identity, return to the `F.18` naming settlement and use the full public name.

### E.4.DPF:2 - Problem

Domain and local framework authors often have strong source material and urgent local needs, but they can lose FPF discipline in three ways. They copy FPF terms without settling the domain ontology. They publish a framework carrier before deciding the framework architecture. Or they produce a useful checklist that is local process guidance but not yet an FPF-grounded pattern framework.

A working framework needs more than a good table of contents. It needs source-grounded pattern selection, architecture decisions, relation records, edition dependencies, names, worked cases, quality evaluation, and refresh conditions.

A DPF is not a domain ontology, glossary, literature survey, or guide to talking about a topic. It exists so an intended practitioner or assisting agent can enter typical problem situations in the domain, avoid known failure modes, and apply source-grounded SoTA solution moves with visible boundaries and refresh conditions. Those failure modes include beginner mistakes and experienced-practitioner failures caused by stale, local-only, or non-SoTA practice. Ontology and vocabulary matter only insofar as they make those problem-solving moves safer and more reusable.

### E.4.DPF:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Domain urgency | The local team needs usable guidance soon, but premature durable names and pattern heads freeze poor ontology. |
| Source richness | Domain traditions provide valuable methods and examples, but source summaries can hide rival traditions and lost evidence. |
| Problem-solving primacy | A DPF may need terms and ontology, but those are supports for recognizing recurring domain problems and choosing SoTA solution moves, not the framework's payoff by themselves. |
| FPF reuse | FPF Core gives strong authoring, relation, and quality patterns, but direct copying can mask domain-specific concerns. |
| Publication need | A framework publication carrier helps readers, but it can hide relation, dependency, and currentness records. |
| Evolution | Domain and local frameworks change and improve as sources, uses, and Core editions change. |

### E.4.DPF:4 - Solution

Author the framework through a spine whose outputs are inspectable at each step:

First-hour route for a first framework:

1. Write a one-paragraph context note: domain or local context, intended reader, first use, and non-use boundary.
2. Create a source-pack stub: source traditions to inspect, rival traditions to avoid losing, first examples, and claim status.
3. Decide which first result is current. Before PFAD, create `FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal@Context` when review of candidate subject organization is current. Open E.4.PFAD when settlement of framework architecture is the current decision. Use C.30.AD only after the framework and its architecture exist. Use `FrameworkAuthoringDependencyDescription@Context` only after PFAD.
4. For a pre-PFAD proposal, make its intended result present through one C.2.1 intended-result description over an A.15.2 `U.WorkPlan`, with one exact A.1-admitted grounding holon. Put candidate organization claims in the proposal's one ClaimGraph.
5. Mark public names provisional: use `Domain Principle Framework` or `Local Practice Framework` in prose, and send durable names or abbreviations to `F.18`.
6. Draft one to three first pattern candidates through `E.8`, each with a recognizable problem frame, known failure mode or local anti-pattern, positive SoTA-informed solution move, worked slice, and boundary. When a stable Solution benefits from a short repeatable Plain formulation, add a local mantra that preserves the Solution's operative distinctions and nearest stop or return condition. A local mantra is optional and pattern-specific; repetition does not make it a new method, work order, U-kind, or `DemonstrativeUnfoldingSlice@Context`. In the first hour these are pattern seeds unless they already pass the declared `E.21` pattern-quality use.
7. Add relation and edition rows for those candidates: source reuse, specialization, publication, dependency, compatibility, or currentness return as needed.
8. Pick the publication or access carrier: readme, preface, table of contents, card set, all-in-one local carrier, split document set, skill pack, MCP-backed access service, or another access face.
9. Name the first quality and currentness route: what will be evaluated, what can improve next, and what source, Core edition, or local-use change reopens the framework.


Stop the first hour when those outputs exist, even if every pattern body is still rough. A rough framework with context, source basis, current first-result relation, provisional names, first pattern candidates, relation rows, publication or access carrier, quality route, and currentness return is inspectable. A long all-in-one carrier without those outputs is not yet an FPF-grounded framework. Do not promote this rough output to a reliance-bearing DPF publication carrier until the DRR or decision carrier is checked for the intended authoring use, the pattern bodies are hardened as normal FPF patterns, and the package is evaluated through `E.4.DPF.DA`.

Keep the authoring apparatus proportional to the next receiving use. A first exploration may stop with the nine seed outputs and no separate publication package. A compact reliance-bearing framework may keep its readme, preface, pattern bodies, relation rows, source-use account, and quality route in one carrier when the same readers and stewards maintain them together. Split source packs, decision records, relation records, pattern files, quality results, skills, or access services only when independent editioning, confidentiality, transfer, automation, delayed feedback, expensive reversal, or another named reliance makes their identity separately useful. The pre-PFAD proposal exists only while candidate subject organization is the current result; the post-PFAD dependency description exists only when dependency availability and next-use relevance must be recovered. More files or records do not make the framework more mature.

If the requester wants a ready DPF rather than a seed, keep the developer DRR or decision carrier separate from the user DPF publication or access carrier, then name which `E.21`, `E.4.DPF.DA`, and currentness checks remain before reliance.
Do not present generated text as authoritative. Before reliance, name the unresolved claims and their returns to `G.2`, `C.35`, `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR`, `F.18`, `E.21`, and `G.11`.
```

1. **Context declaration.** State the domain or local bounded context, intended reader, first use, and non-use boundary.
2. **Source pack.** Use `G.2` to gather SoTA traditions, claim sheets, examples, source-use decisions, rejected alternatives, and source-currentness notes.
3. **Organization proposal or architecture decision.** Before PFAD, use E.4.DPF to create the current C.2.1 organization-design proposal described in 4.2-4.4. When framework-architecture settlement is current, use `E.9` and `E.4.PFAD` to decide purpose, framework family, domain or local problem-and-solution architecture, pattern split, relation structure, publication carrier, access carrier, dependency boundary, and source-return conditions. Do not use a dependency description to postpone PFAD.
4. **Name preparation.** Use `E.10` for kind discipline and `F.18` for durable names before public pattern heads or abbreviations are stabilized.
5. **Carrier admission.** Use `C.33`, `C.34`, or `C.35` before relying on all-in-one carriers, tables of contents, relation graphs, source summaries, search outputs, transformed views, or generated candidates as architecture evidence.
6. **Pattern drafting.** Draft patterns with `E.8`: recognition text, positive solution, worked cases, boundary, local anti-patterns, SoTA-Echoing, conformance checks, and relations. In a DPF, those pattern bodies are the pattern-language rendering of selected domain or local problem-situation architecture and solution-move architecture. `E.8` means a normal action-guiding pattern body, not only a section skeleton. When repeated first use benefits from an attentional aid, write a local mantra by compressing that pattern's Solution without dropping the distinction that makes the move work or the condition that stops, returns, or redirects it. Keep an established local name such as `mnemonic`, `watchword`, or `heuristic` when it explains the aid better. Use `A.22.CGUS` only when the aid presents admissible conditional continuations through a named wider `ConstraintGovernedUnfoldingStructure@Context`; ordinary local mantras require neither a CGUS admission nor an F.17 term row. A thin skeleton, prompt seed, compressed design note, or memorable slogan detached from the Solution remains a pattern seed until `E.21` says the pattern is adequate for the declared DPF use.
7. **Relation and edition discipline.** Use `E.4.PFR` for relation functions, dependency direction, compatibility boundary, deprecation, supersession, and edition effects.
8. **Quality cycle.** Use `E.22` to frame the evaluation purpose, quality floor, trade-off question, and expected improvement proposal when that frame is not already scoped. Use `E.4.DPF.DA` to evaluate the package as a DPF or local-framework package, `E.21` to evaluate individual pattern quality, `E.23` for repeated improvement, and `E.19` only when admission or profile gating is actually being claimed. If an evaluation result needs a carrier, publish or refresh that carrier through the pattern governing its publication or currentness relation rather than through `E.22`.
9. **Admission review.** Use `E.19` when the local process asks whether a pattern or framework slice is ready for admission.
10. **Framework publication-or-access carrier assembly.** Publish or expose the framework in its own DPF or local-framework carrier: all-in-one local carrier, split readme, preface, and pattern files, table of contents, cards, skill pack, MCP-backed access service, retrieval route, or another first-use access form. Do not land domain or local frameworks into `FPF-Spec.md` by default.
11. **Currentness route.** Use `G.11` for refresh plans, edition pins, source decay, deprecation, and supersession conditions.

Localize each repair before returning to wider framework architecture. A changed source payload first returns to its `G.2` source-use decision and then only to patterns, examples, or relations that relied on that payload. A changed Core or depended-on framework edition first updates the affected `E.4.PFR` dependency, compatibility, and migration relations. Repeated misuse of one pattern first returns to that pattern's `E.21` result and its `E.23` improvement loop. A failed publication or access route first returns to `E.11`, `E.17`, or the carrier relation that exposed it. A local mantra that no longer preserves its pattern's Solution first returns to that pattern body; `A.22.CGUS` becomes current only if the repaired aid must present a wider conditional unfolding. Return to `E.4.PFAD` only when the evidence changes selected framework-family, pattern-split, relation-structure, publication or access architecture, or dependency-boundary decisions. Use `G.11` when edition currentness, source decay, telemetry, deprecation, or supersession must be orchestrated across those local repairs.

For an all-in-one DPF publication carrier, assemble the content in a reproducible order. This order is a publication shape, not a new framework kind:

1. Public framework title and package edition ref: use a domain- or practice-specific framework name such as `<DomainOrPractice> Principles Framework`; `Principles Framework` alone is only the head or kind phrase, not an individual framework name. Do not put `local monolith`, `draft`, process status, or file-layout slang in the public title.
2. Dependency declaration: FPF Core edition, depended-on DPF or local-framework editions, and blocked reverse dependency.
3. Table of contents: pattern bodies first as the main language of use; support maps and relation records remain reachable without becoming a universal first inspection sequence.
4. Readme or first practical entries: intended reader, first use, non-use boundary, first outputs, and a short statement of which selected domain or local structures this carrier exposes for that reader.
5. Preface or framework context: cross-cutting ideas that make the pattern set cohere, plus the selected structure families the carrier foregrounds, deliberately coarsens, defers, or sends back to sources and pattern bodies.
6. Package carrier structure-account: intended reader and use, selected source-structure denominator, recurring problem-situation structures, reusable solution-move structures, captured structure, deliberately coarsened, abstracted, omitted, or lost structure, source-return condition, and quality or epiplexity route. This may be a short subsection in the readme or preface when the carrier is compact.
7. Package boundary and governing-pattern routing: Core governing patterns reused, local terms bounded, and source, evidence, assurance, publication, and refresh exits named.
8. Pattern index: pattern ids, titles, first use, and any local prefix discipline.
9. Pattern bodies: each drafted through `E.8`, with recognition text, positive solution, worked cases, local anti-patterns, SoTA-Echoing, conformance checks, and relations, and each evaluated or explicitly marked as a seed under `E.21` before the package is claimed for public, teaching, enterprise, or reliance-bearing use.
10. Heterogeneous acceptance cases or transfer probes: examples that force the pattern set to work across unlike uses rather than only repeating the motivating case.
11. Support maps or appendices: architecture bridge, source-use map, precision map, package-name route, or other reference material placed after pattern bodies unless a short front-door trigger table is needed.
12. Source use and refresh map: source rows with adopted payload, rejected or bounded readings, return conditions to `G.2` for source use, and return conditions to `G.11` for source currentness or refresh orchestration.
13. Pattern-framework relation and edition records: `E.4.PFR` rows for dependency, specialization, publication, source reuse, evaluation, generated-carrier, teaching publication-carrier, ethics, deprecation, or supersession relations.
14. Refresh route: what returns to source, pattern quality, package adequacy, edition dependency, or publication carrier when source, Core edition, local use, telemetry, or evaluation changes.
Every DPF publication or access carrier bears or serves a publication expression or access expression that makes selected domain or local structures available for a declared reader and use; the carrier is not itself the framework edition, the domain, or a narrative by type. In an all-in-one publication carrier, the readme and preface usually carry the first explanatory route, and sometimes a narrative rendering, through the domain. Their representation relation remains inspectable when they say what they are telling, for whom, which structures they foreground, which structures are deliberately coarsened, abstracted, omitted, or left to source return, and where a reader returns for fuller pattern, source, evidence, or relation detail. This is not only text-to-text summarization: the source-bearing side may be actual or possible holon structure, an architecture description, a view, a source pack, a model, a graph, or a pattern set. In architecture-mediated narrative-rendering use, read the return chain as `narrative rendering carried by a publication or access carrier -> architecture description or view -> architecture as selected structures in context -> wider source structures`. When no narrative rendering is present, read the first step as `framework publication or access carrier -> selected source structures`. Each step has selected structure, captured structure, coarsening, abstraction, omission, loss, and return conditions. An architecture description is often already a coarsened representation of selected real, expected, candidate, or actual structures, so the DPF carrier keeps that second-step loss visible. This does not make every DPF a literary narrative or make every carrier a narrative; it makes the publication-expression or access-expression representation relation inspectable. When a sequential narrative rendering is load-bearing, use `A.6.3.NAR`; when the publication expression deliberately keeps only a narrower-use coarsened rendering, use `A.6.3.CSC`; for structure capture and loss, use `C.33`; for same-enough or preservation claims, use `C.34`; for practical-use publication, use `E.11` and `E.17`; for package adequacy, use `E.4.DPF.DA`.

Keep process state out of the carrier. DRR text, handoff notes, ledger rows, review status, helper state, admission blockers, and landing evidence may shape the package, but the publication carrier should contain only durable user-facing package content, source-use boundaries, relation records, quality routes, and refresh conditions. A short source-use or relation record may appear in the user carrier when it helps readers and maintainers use the DPF; a DRR argument, review transcript, or quality proof does not.

For skill packs and MCP-backed access, keep the same framework edition identity and relation records visible. A skill or endpoint may help a user find, select, retrieve, render, or apply DPF patterns, but it is an access carrier until another governing pattern makes a stronger claim. If the carrier generates candidate text, use `C.35`; if it performs work or triggers tools, use `A.15` and the pattern governing the local tool or work relation; if it claims currentness, evidence, assurance, or decision authority, use `G.11`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `E.9`, or the pattern governing that exact claim. Do not read a skill manifest, MCP tool name, endpoint schema, or protocol route as the DPF architecture.

Starter evaluation characteristics for a principle-framework improvement loop:

| Characteristic question | Governing pattern to use |
| --- | --- |
| Discoverability | Can the intended reader find the first useful entry and governing pattern? Use `E.11`, then evaluate the pattern or projection through the applicable evaluation pattern. |
| Source fidelity | Are adopted and rejected source payloads recoverable in source packs, solutions, boundaries, and examples? Use `G.2`, `C.33`, `C.34`, and pattern-quality evaluation. |
| Ontology clarity | Are Core, domain, local, publication, source, decision, relation, quality, and refresh claims kept as different kinds? Use `E.10`, `F.18`, `F.19`, and the pattern governing the exact claim. |
| Relation typedness | Are pattern-use, specialization, dependency, publication, preservation, quality, and source-use relations separated? Use `E.4.PFR`. |
| Compatibility impact | Can maintainers see which structures or claims break and which migrations become current when Core, domain, or local editions change? Use `E.4.PFR`, `E.5.3`, and `G.11`. |
| Refreshability | Are source decay, edition pins, local-use telemetry, and supersession conditions actionable? Use `G.11`. |
| Package navigability | Can the selected pattern set, relation records, source packs, decision records, quality evidence, and practical-use or access carrier be found without treating the package as runtime machinery? Use `G.5`, `E.4.PFR`, and `E.11`. |
| Adoption telemetry | Are repeated reader errors, skipped records, stale sources, and local-use failures routed to refresh or improvement? Use `G.11` and `E.23`. |
| Didactic first use | Can a first-time domain or local author write the first useful output without prior FPF developer knowledge? Use `E.11`, `E.12`, `E.21`, and `E.23`. |

These are evaluation characteristics for selecting and framing improvement work. They are not measurement programs by themselves. If the pass needs a DPF package adequacy result, use `E.4.DPF.DA`; if it needs individual pattern quality, use `E.21`; if it needs DRR adequacy, FPF-level Pillar adequacy, measurement, evidence, or architecture-characteristic evaluation, use the pattern that owns that object, such as `E.9.DA`, `E.2.DA`, `C.16`, `A.10`, or the relevant architecture-characteristic pattern.

The spine is complete only when a reader can answer: what framework edition is being authored, what problem-and-solution architecture it renders, which sources and decisions shaped it, which patterns and relations were selected, where it is published, how quality improves, and when it returns for refresh or repair.

#### E.4.DPF:4.1 - Select the current first result

DPF authoring has four possible first results under explicit conditions:

1. `E.4.DPF Solution -> FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal@Context` when PFAD is not yet settled and the immediate result is a current proposal episteme that makes candidate organization claims about an intended future framework result reviewable. The proposal exists now; the future framework need not.
2. `E.4.PFAD Solution -> PrincipleFrameworkArchitectureDecision@Context` when framework family, Core dependency boundary, content boundary, pattern relation structure, or publication and access architecture is the current decision question. This is the first settled framework-architecture result.
3. `C.30.AD Solution -> ArchitectureDescriptionUseCard@Project` only after the relevant framework entity, an actual `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim, and selected architecture-relevant structures exist and the immediate question is how that architecture description may be used.
4. `E.4.DPF Solution -> FrameworkAuthoringDependencyDescription@Context` only when PFAD exists and the immediate question is which later authoring dependencies exist and which are relevant to the next authoring use.

The pre-PFAD result is one present proposal episteme, not a reference to the absent future framework and not an architecture description. It conforms to C.2.1 instead of defining a second local episteme architecture.

#### E.4.DPF:4.2 - Make the intended result reviewable before PFAD

First make the design target present. `IntendedFrameworkResultDescription@Context` is a project-local use name for one current C.2.1-conformant `U.EpistemeCard`, not a root kind. Its `EntityOfConcernSlot` names a current `U.WorkPlan` under A.15.2. That work plan declares the intended DPF-authoring work, the intended framework-result kind, and its acceptance target; it is present now, while the authoring work and framework result may remain future.

The description's `ClaimGraphSlot` records the intended bounded context, readers, first uses, purpose, declared relation-family coverage constraints, and other intended-result constraints and acceptance conditions. Its `ReferenceSchemeSlot` interprets those claims as statements about the intended result of the named work plan; it does not assert future work, an actual framework entity, or an actual future relation.

Its `GroundingHolonSlot` names one exact current `U.Holon` in which those claims are maintained and can be checked. A person, team, or organization fills this slot only after A.1 admits that entity as a `U.Holon`. The authoring project is described through the `U.WorkPlan`, later `U.Work` occurrences, the admitted collective or person holon, and their direct relations; `project` itself is neither a U-kind nor an admissible holon filler.

Each declared relation-family coverage constraint is one `FrameworkOrganizationCandidateClaimNode` with `claimNodeKind=constraint`. Its `coveredRelationFamilyRefKindPairs[1..*]` identifies each covered relation-family value together with its exact kind; `admittedFrameworkUseDescriptionRef` names the use for which that coverage matters; and `coverageCriterionDescriptionRef` states how satisfaction of this coverage constraint is judged. A current A.15.2 WorkPlan acceptance target remains a different position: cite it through `designBasisRefs[]` or its direct acceptance-target relation. It neither replaces the coverage criterion nor shares one union field with it.

#### E.4.DPF:4.3 - Create one C.2.1 proposal episteme

The organization proposal uses that present intended-result description as its one EntityOfConcern:

```text
FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal@Context <: U.Episteme:
  boundedContextRef: U.BoundedContextRef
  entityOfConcernRef: U.EntityRef
    = current IntendedFrameworkResultDescription@Context episteme
  groundingHolonRef: U.HolonRef
    = IntendedFrameworkResultDescription@Context.groundingHolonRef
  content: U.ClaimGraph
  referenceScheme: U.ReferenceScheme
  meta: edition, provenance, and proposal status under C.2.1, A.7, and F.15
```

This species realizes one C.2.1 `U.EpistemeKind`: `entityOfConcernRef` fills `EntityOfConcernSlot`; `groundingHolonRef` fills `GroundingHolonSlot` and equals the grounding holon of the `IntendedFrameworkResultDescription@Context` that fills `EntityOfConcernSlot`; `content` fills the single constituting `ClaimGraphSlot`; and `referenceScheme` fills `ReferenceSchemeSlot`.

No local different-grounding branch or unnamed bridge is admitted. A future case needing another grounding holon first returns to C.2.1 and A.6.2, and to F.9 only when a cross-context Bridge is actually current; it produces a separately grounded episteme or edition before E.4.DPF resumes. No `CandidateFrameworkOrganizationClaim@Context <: U.Episteme` is introduced. Candidate claims are typed nodes in `content`, with logical, alternative, refinement, dependency, support, conflict, and answer-to-question edges as current.

Each candidate organization claim node makes the subject-level proposal recoverable:

```text
FrameworkOrganizationCandidateClaimNode:
  claimNodeKey: semantic key unique within content
  claimNodeKind: FrameworkOrganizationClaimNodeKindValue
  claimStatus: FrameworkOrganizationClaimStatusValue
  intendedResultAspect: FrameworkOrganizationAspectValue
  describedPositionKinds[1..*]: U.Kind
  proposedSubjectRelationSignatures[0..*]: RelationSignature
  proposedConstraintDescriptionRefs[0..*]: U.EpistemeRef
  coveredRelationFamilyRefKindPairs[0..*]: FrameworkRelationFamilyRefKindPair; cardinality [1..*] for a relation-family coverage constraint node
  admittedFrameworkUseDescriptionRef?: U.EpistemeRef; exactly one for a relation-family coverage constraint node
  coverageCriterionDescriptionRef?: U.EpistemeRef; exactly one for a relation-family coverage constraint node
  proposedInvariantDescriptionRefs[0..*]: U.EpistemeRef
  proposedDependencyDirectionDescriptionRefs[0..*]: U.EpistemeRef
  alternativeGroupKey?: semantic key unique within content
  designBasisRefs[1..*]: U.EpistemeRef
  designQuestionRefs[1..*]: U.EpistemeRef
  pfadSettlementConditionRef?: U.EpistemeRef

FrameworkRelationFamilyRefKindPair:
  relationFamilyRef: U.EntityRef
  relationFamilyKindRef: U.KindRef
```

`FrameworkOrganizationCandidateClaimNode` is a local ClaimGraph node form, not a U-kind and not an episteme. `FrameworkOrganizationClaimNodeKindValue` is the local C.2.1-compatible enumeration `definition | constraint | property | assumption`. A node with `claimNodeKind=constraint` classifies a proposed constraint claim; its `proposedConstraintDescriptionRefs[]` identify the exact constraint descriptions that the node asserts, while a non-constraint node may cite those refs only when they qualify that definition, property, or assumption.

A relation-family coverage constraint node also has non-empty `coveredRelationFamilyRefKindPairs[]`, one `admittedFrameworkUseDescriptionRef`, and one `coverageCriterionDescriptionRef`; other claim nodes leave all three coverage positions absent. Each pair identifies one relation-family value and its exact kind without a union field or an untyped companion list. A WorkPlan acceptance target, when current, is cited separately through `designBasisRefs[]` or its direct acceptance-target relation. Neither constraint position is deontic. If an obligation, recommendation-as-duty, or prohibition with an accountable subject and issuing or authority relation is current, use `A.2.8 -> U.Commitment`; if a strong or weak permission, exercise, non-violation, or permission-conflict claim is current, use the exact `A.2.8.PER` result with the participants, references, constructive ground, and qualifiers required by that selected `A.2.8.PER` object.

`FrameworkOrganizationClaimStatusValue` is the local enumeration `candidateProposed | rejectedAlternative | unresolved`. `FrameworkOrganizationAspectValue` is the local enumeration `frameworkFamily | component | dependency | patternRelation | publication | access`; a domain extension adds another value only together with its exact interpretation rule in the proposal's ReferenceScheme. Proposedness is claim modality: it says that a relation signature, position, constraint, invariant, or dependency direction is being proposed for the intended result. It does not assert an actual relation instance or actual `U.Structure`, and it is not encoded as `PatternUseBoundaryCondition@Context`.

The proposal's `referenceScheme` maps each organization-aspect value, described position kind, and proposed relation signature to claim content about the result described by `entityOfConcernRef`; distinguishes ClaimGraph edges from the subject relations those claims propose; declares how basis and design-question refs qualify each claim; and states that claim status is modal rather than actual. Thus a claim node can propose that one pattern family depends on Core, that publication and access remain separate positions, or that one relation invariant is preserved, without pretending that the future framework or those relations already exist.

#### E.4.DPF:4.4 - Preserve result, PFAD, structure, and architecture boundaries

Keep the two result positions separate. If reliance-bearing E.11.PUA support materializes `PatternUseResultExpectation@Context` for this E.4.DPF application, its expected result kind is exactly `FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal@Context`. The intended later framework edition is described inside the separate `IntendedFrameworkResultDescription@Context` and the proposal's ClaimGraph. One expectation record never denotes both results.

PFAD return is also separate from claim modality. When a reliance-bearing use needs an addressable boundary record, `PatternUseBoundaryCondition@Context` carries `boundaryKind=return`, names E.4.PFAD as the receiving pattern, and states which candidate claim, alternative, unresolved position, constraint, or dependency makes framework-architecture settlement current. The boundary is adjacent support for using the proposal; it is not a component that makes a claim proposed.

Subject organization is recovered from the candidate claim nodes, proposed subject relation signatures, described position kinds, constraints, invariants, dependency directions, alternatives, basis, questions, and PFAD settlement conditions. An A.22 `U.Structure` over the proposal ClaimGraph is optional and admissible only when the organization of the proposal episteme itself is a separate current EntityOfConcern. That meta-structure is never the admission criterion for `FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal@Context` and never substitutes for the organization being proposed. A topic list fails because it lacks candidate organization claims and proposed subject relation content, even if its headings or ClaimGraph are well organized.

Pre-realization C.33 notes compare proposal content only with a declared current comparator: design questions, present basis epistemes, candidate alternatives, a relation-family coverage constraint claim node for an admitted framework use, or an earlier existing framework edition. When coverage is the comparator, C.33 cites the exact `FrameworkOrganizationCandidateClaimNode` and reads its covered family ref-kind pairs, admitted use, and coverage criterion. A separate WorkPlan acceptance target may appear in `designBasisRefs[]` or through its direct relation but never substitutes for the coverage criterion. The notes may report represented, omitted, hidden, or unresolved candidate organization content relative to that basis. They do not claim captured structure relative to an unknown future actual framework. Comparison with actual framework structures starts only after the framework entity and relevant structures exist.

No E.17.0 `DescriptionContext` targets the absent future framework. Later PFAD, C.32, C.30, and C.30.AD results use their direct patterns and admission conditions; none retroactively retypes this proposal, its intended-result description, or its optional meta-structure as architecture or as an architecture description.

#### E.4.DPF:4.5 - Describe post-PFAD authoring dependencies

The dependency description is minimal and status-bearing. It does not presume that later authoring products already exist:

```text
FrameworkAuthoringDependencyDescription@Context <: U.Episteme:
  boundedContextRef: U.BoundedContextRef
  entityOfConcernRef: U.EntityRef
    = current DPF-authoring U.WorkPlan
  groundingHolonRef: U.HolonRef
    = exact A.1-admitted holon maintaining these dependency claims
  content: U.ClaimGraph
    = dependency positions and their availability, relevance, value, governing-pattern, acquisition-condition, and next-use-boundary relations
  referenceScheme: U.ReferenceScheme
    = interpretation of those claims as dependencies of entityOfConcernRef for the declared next authoring use
  intendedReaderDescriptionRef: U.EpistemeRef
  intendedFirstUseDescriptionRef: U.EpistemeRef
  dependencyPositionRefs[3..*]: U.EntityRef, each referencing one FrameworkAuthoringDependencyPosition@Context
  nextAuthoringUseBoundaryRef: U.EpistemeRef, referencing one PatternUseBoundaryCondition@Context
  meta: edition, provenance, and dependency-assessment status under C.2.1, A.7, and F.15

FrameworkAuthoringDependencyPosition@Context:
  dependencyDescriptionRef: U.EpistemeRef, referencing one FrameworkAuthoringDependencyDescription@Context
  dependencyKind: FrameworkAuthoringDependencyKindValue
  dependencyAvailability: FrameworkAuthoringDependencyAvailabilityValue
  dependencyUseRelevance: FrameworkAuthoringDependencyUseRelevanceValue
  dependencyValueRef?: U.EntityRef
  dependencyValueKindRef?: U.KindRef
  dependencyGoverningPatternRef: U.EntityRef, referencing one U.MethodDescription
  dependencyAcquisitionConditionDescriptionRef?: U.EpistemeRef
```

This species uses the same C.2.1 constitution as the proposal episteme. Its EntityOfConcern is the present authoring WorkPlan whose next use depends on the described values. Its grounding holon is the exact current A.1-admitted holon in which the dependency claims are maintained and checked. Its one ClaimGraph contains the dependency positions and their relations; its ReferenceScheme interprets availability and relevance as claims about dependencies of that WorkPlan for the declared next use. Reader and first-use descriptions qualify those claims. They do not replace EntityOfConcernSlot, GroundingHolonSlot, ClaimGraphSlot, or ReferenceSchemeSlot. A different grounding or context first returns to C.2.1 and A.6.2, and to F.9 only when an actual cross-context Bridge is current.

`FrameworkAuthoringDependencyKindValue` is `fpfCoreEdition | sourceBasis | frameworkArchitectureDecision | nameRoute | patternDraftSet | relationAndEditionRecords | publicationOrAccess | packageQuality | improvement | currentness`. `FrameworkAuthoringDependencyAvailabilityValue` is `available | missing`. `FrameworkAuthoringDependencyUseRelevanceValue` is `currentForNextAuthoringUse | retainedForLaterUse | relevanceUnsettled`.

The minimum three positions are exactly one `fpfCoreEdition`, one `sourceBasis`, and one `frameworkArchitectureDecision`. The architecture-decision position and the Core-edition position are `available` and carry exact value and kind refs; otherwise post-PFAD dependency description is not yet admissible. The source-basis position follows the ordinary availability and relevance branches below and may therefore expose a blocking missing source pack. Add another dependency kind only when the declared next authoring use relies on that dependency or deliberately retains it for a named later use.

When `dependencyAvailability=available`, the exact dependency value ref and kind ref are present and `dependencyAcquisitionConditionDescriptionRef` is absent. When `dependencyAvailability=missing`, the value ref and kind ref are absent and the acquisition-condition description is present. Next-use relevance remains independent in both branches: `missing + currentForNextAuthoringUse` blocks the next authoring use and opens the stated return, while `missing + retainedForLaterUse` does not block the current use. A condition on using an available dependency belongs to that dependency's direct governing pattern or to `nextAuthoringUseBoundaryRef`, never to the acquisition position.

Every admitted dependency description contains a `frameworkArchitectureDecision` position with `availability=available` and the exact PFAD ref and kind, and an `fpfCoreEdition` position with the exact selected Core-edition ref and kind. A missing PFAD returns to E.4.PFAD and prevents construction of the description. A missing or unsettled Core-edition decision returns to the dependency boundary settled by E.4.PFAD and E.4.PFR before this description resumes.

As authoring proceeds, the same description may reference E.4.PFR edition dependencies, G.2 source packs, E.4.PFAD decisions, subject-home NameCards, E.8 pattern drafts, E.4.PFR relation and edition records, E.17 publication relations, E.4.DPF access relations, E.4.DPF.DA evaluations, E.23 improvement records, and G.11 currentness relations. Each value remains governed by its direct pattern. The description is neither the framework edition nor a substitute for those values.

### E.4.DPF:5 - Archetypal Grounding


Tell: A hydroponic-cucumber framework begins with crop-production concerns, horticulture and greenhouse-control sources, local examples, and FPF Core dependency. Its first all-in-one publication carrier is for domain users, while relation records, source packs, and quality evaluations remain separately recoverable.

Show: A neural-network architecture framework may draw on dataflow architecture, model components, training and inference concerns, evaluation practice, and recent architecture-analysis work. The framework can describe layers, blocks, flows, optimization constraints, and interpretability concerns; each resulting pattern is grounded through `G.2`, drafted through `E.8`, and related through `E.4.PFR`.

Show: A workspace-specific Codex process framework can contain prelanding and baton-handoff patterns. It should state its local context, dependency on FPF Core, process sources, local carriers, and refresh route. A useful local checklist stays a local checklist until it has source grounding, pattern bodies, relation records, and quality evaluation.

Show: An enterprise local practice framework for architecture review starts from the organization's review context, internal policies, proprietary examples, and approval path. It can depend on FPF Core and on a domain principle framework, but its confidential evidence, role assignments, training plan, and rollout telemetry stay local.

Enterprise local-practice slice:

| Output | Enterprise question |
| --- | --- |
| Local context | Which organization, product line, team, role context, and decision class is governed? |
| Internal sources | Which policies, standards, review records, incidents, templates, and examples are adopted or rejected? |
| Constraints | Which regulatory, confidentiality, intellectual-property, tool-access, and security boundaries constrain publication? |
| Stewardship assignments | Which steward role is assigned responsibility for the framework edition, source pack, relation records, publication or access carrier, and refresh plan? |
| Approval route | Which management, engineering, safety, legal, or assurance reviews are needed before local use? |
| Rollout and training | Which roles need first-use examples, training material, and migration support? |
| Dependency | Which FPF Core edition and domain framework edition are depended on, and which reverse dependency is blocked? |
| Migration | What changes after FPF Core edition change, domain-framework edition change, policy change, or repeated local misuse? |
| Adoption telemetry | Which reader errors, skipped relation records, stale source packs, or quality regressions trigger `G.11` refresh? |

Replayable authoring slice:

| Authoring output | Filled slice |
| --- | --- |
| Context declaration | `GreenhouseCropDomain`, intended reader: crop-system architect and senior grower; first use: decide first pattern set for cucumber production guidance |
| `G.2` source pack | greenhouse climate-control sources, crop nutrition sources, local production logs; rejected source: generic gardening advice without controlled-environment evidence |
| Architecture decision | `PFAD-HC-001` selects four first patterns, a publication or access carrier, and a one-way dependency on FPF Core; the domain framework is not incorporated into FPF Core |
| Naming route | provisional `HydroponicCucumberPrincipleFramework`; the public abbreviation remains provisional until an `F.18` NameCard is current |
| First pattern draft | `HC.NutrientMonitoring` drafted with `E.8`: problem frame, solution, worked greenhouse slice, SoTA row, conformance checks |
| Relation and edition record | `PFR-HC-source-reuse` links nutrient pattern to source pack; dependency record points to `FPFCorePatternSet@current` |
| Quality cycle | `E.22` frames evaluation purpose; `E.21` scores first draft; `E.23` records the next improvement loop |
| Local publication or access | framework readme, table of contents, skill pack, or MCP-backed access route exposes the framework after source-return notes are present |
| Refresh route | `G.11` refresh when source pack, Core edition, or greenhouse-control practice changes |

#### Local-mantra authoring slice

After the `HC.NutrientMonitoring` Solution is stable, its authors use the local mantra: *Name the crop stage and root-zone condition; establish that the measurement is usable in its current calibration range; compare it with the stage-specific range; change the control setting only within the declared operating boundary; return when crop stage, sensor validity, or operating boundary changes.* The formula helps a grower or crop-system architect keep the pattern's operative distinctions and return condition in attention. It remains Plain wording inside `HC.NutrientMonitoring`; it is not another nutrient-control method, work order, U-kind, or F.17 publication obligation.

If a seminar instead needs to show alternative continuations for invalid measurement, out-of-range nutrient condition, control saturation, and crop-stage transition through one named wider unfolding structure, the authors open `A.22.CGUS` and build a demonstrative walkthrough. They do not obtain that structure merely by extending or repeating the local mantra.

#### Pre-PFAD proposal slice

A team intends a new clinical-method DPF but has not decided its framework architecture. It creates one current `U.WorkPlan` for DPF authoring, then one `IntendedFrameworkResultDescription@Context` grounded in the exact admitted team holon. `FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal@Context` uses that description as its EntityOfConcern and proposes candidate pattern-family, dependency, publication, and access relations in one ClaimGraph. The proposal is the current result. No future framework entity, actual architecture, or architecture description is asserted.

#### Coverage and acceptance slice

The proposal's medication-review coverage criterion names the pattern families whose representation is necessary for that declared use. One constraint claim node names the covered relation-family refs with exact kinds, that admitted use, and the coverage criterion. The authoring WorkPlan separately cites an acceptance target for review completion. C.33 uses the coverage node as comparator when evaluating proposal coverage; the WorkPlan target does not replace the criterion.

#### Grounding stress slice

The intended-result description is grounded in `MedicationReviewTeam@Hospital-A`, an A.1-admitted holon. The proposal uses the same grounding ref. A request to ground the proposal in a different consortium stops E.4.DPF and returns first to C.2.1 and A.6.2. The pattern does not create a local bridge merely to keep drafting moving.

#### Post-PFAD dependency slice

PFAD exists. The Core edition is available and relevant now, so its dependency position has exact value and kind refs and no acquisition condition. A publication carrier is missing but retained for later use, so its position has no value refs, has an acquisition-condition description, and does not block current pattern drafting. A missing source pack marked `currentForNextAuthoringUse` blocks the next use and opens the stated return. Availability never stands for relevance.

#### Framework-evolution slice

A new controlled-environment study changes the admissible nutrient range used only by `HC.NutrientMonitoring`. `G.2` first revises the source-use decision and preserves the displaced source reading. `E.4.PFR` identifies the nutrient pattern, its source-reuse relation, and its dependent examples as the affected set. `E.21` evaluates the revised pattern body; `E.23` governs repeated improvement of that pattern edition; `G.11` governs currentness, telemetry, and deprecation or supersession of exposed editions. Unaffected climate-control and harvest-feedback patterns remain current. `E.4.PFAD` stays closed while framework family, pattern split, relation structure, publication or access architecture, and dependency boundary remain unchanged; a change to one of those decisions makes PFAD current again.

### E.4.DPF:6 - Bias-Annotation


The first drift is source-summary confidence: a summary feels sufficient because it names the right domain terms. The repair is to turn sources into a `G.2` source pack with adopted and rejected payload, then carry that payload into pattern solutions and examples.

The second drift is publication-carrier-first authoring. The repair is not to delay publication forever; it is to publish after the architecture decision, relation records, and source-return notes are recoverable.

### E.4.DPF:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Passing condition |
| --- | --- |
| CC-DPF.1 Context declared | Domain or local bounded context, intended reader, first use, and non-use boundary are named. |
| CC-DPF.2 Source pack present | `G.2` source basis includes adopted payload, rejected alternatives, examples, claim status, and currentness notes. |
| CC-DPF.3 Architecture decision present | `E.4.PFAD` or direct `E.9` plus `C.32.PAD` records purpose, domain or local problem-and-solution architecture, pattern split, relation structure, publication or access unit, dependency boundary, and consequences. |
| CC-DPF.4 Names prepared | Durable public names and abbreviations have `F.18` name-card work or are explicitly provisional source aliases. |
| CC-DPF.5 Carriers admitted | Any all-in-one carrier, skill pack, MCP-backed access route, graph, generated set, source summary, or transformed view used as evidence has `C.33`, `C.34`, or `C.35` treatment. |
| CC-DPF.6 Patterns drafted through E.8 | Pattern bodies carry recognition text for recurring domain or local problem situations, positive SoTA-informed solution moves, worked cases, known failure modes or local anti-patterns, checklist, SoTA-Echoing, and relations. Skeletons, prompt seeds, and compressed design notes are named as seeds rather than treated as normal DPF patterns. |
| CC-DPF.7 Quality and refresh routes present | `E.22` frames evaluation purpose when needed; `E.4.DPF.DA` package adequacy, `E.21` pattern quality, `E.23` improvement, and `G.11` refresh routes are named with edition or refresh conditions. Public, teaching, enterprise, or reliance-bearing DPF publication names the checked pattern-quality basis or remains `seedOnly`. |
| CC-DPF.8 Carrier structure-account visible | Readme, Preface, or equivalent practical-use carrier says which domain or local problem-and-solution structures the framework exposes, for whom, what is foregrounded, deliberately coarsened, abstracted, omitted, deferred, or lost, and where source, pattern, evidence, or relation return happens. |
| CC-DPF.9 Problem-solving primacy | The DPF tells which typical domain or local problems it helps solve, which known failure modes it blocks, and which source-grounded SoTA solution moves it offers. If it mainly provides vocabulary, ontology, commentary, or conversation guidance, it is not yet a reliance-bearing DPF. |
| CC-DPF.10 Current first result | The selected result is exactly the pre-PFAD proposal, settled PFAD architecture decision, post-existence architecture-description use, or post-PFAD dependency description under its stated condition. |
| CC-DPF.11 C.2.1 proposal constitution | Proposal EoC is the current intended-result description over an A.15.2 WorkPlan; proposal and description use the same exact A.1-admitted grounding holon; one ClaimGraph and one ReferenceScheme are present. |
| CC-DPF.12 Subject organization | Candidate organization is recoverable from typed claim nodes and proposed subject relations; no future entity, episteme-per-claim wrapper, or proposal-document meta-structure substitutes for it. |
| CC-DPF.13 Coverage distinction | A coverage constraint node has family ref-kind pairs, one admitted use, and one criterion; any WorkPlan acceptance target remains separate. |
| CC-DPF.14 Architecture boundary | C.33 compares with a declared present comparator; C.30.AD starts only after the framework entity, ArchitectureOf relation, and selected structures exist. |
| CC-DPF.15 Dependency description and branches | The description has C.2.1 EntityOfConcern, grounding holon, ClaimGraph, and ReferenceScheme positions. Its minimum positions are Core edition, source basis, and PFAD; Core edition and PFAD are available with exact value-kind refs. Other available positions have exact value and kind without acquisition condition; missing positions have acquisition condition without value; relevance remains independent. |

### E.4.DPF:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Checklist promoted to framework | Local tips are published as a principle framework without source, relation, or quality work. | Treat the checklist as local process text until `G.2`, `E.8`, `E.4.PFR`, and `E.21` are satisfied. |
| Source summary as SoTA | A literature summary replaces adopted and rejected source payload. | Build a `G.2` source pack and carry each load-bearing source into solution, boundary, or example text. |
| Ontology catalog as framework | The package classifies the domain or defines terms, but it does not tell a practitioner what typical problem is live or what SoTA solution move avoids a known failure. | Keep ontology as support material; draft or repair DPF patterns around problem frames, positive solution moves, worked cases, anti-patterns, and refresh. |
| Publication carrier as architecture | The publication or access carrier hides relation and dependency records. | Add `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR`, and source-return records before relying on the carrier as architecture evidence. |
| Invisible framework story | A DPF carrier reads as a neutral list of principles, but the reader cannot tell what source or domain structures were selected, why this route is for them, what was deliberately coarsened, abstracted, omitted, or left to source return, or whether the carrier is a second-step coarsening after an architecture description or view. | Add a short carrier structure-account in the readme, Preface, or equivalent carrier, then evaluate it through `E.4.DPF.DA` rather than scattering explanation into every pattern body. |
| Generated candidate authority | Search or LLM output becomes the framework because it is fluent. | Use `C.35` for admission, then decide candidate selection through `E.4.PFAD` or `C.32`. |
| Skeleton carrier as DPF | A file has a ToC, headings, and very short pattern-shaped sections, but readers still cannot apply the patterns without reconstructing the missing guidance from the DRR or source notes. | Keep it as `seedOnly`; harden each DPF pattern through `E.8`, evaluate through `E.21`, and only then assemble the user publication carrier. |
| Access carrier as framework | A skill pack, MCP endpoint, retrieval route, or assistant integration is treated as the framework itself because it is what agents call. | Record it as an access carrier through `E.4.PFR`, expose framework edition and currentness refs, and route generated, tool, evidence, currentness, or work claims to their governing patterns. |
| Future framework fabricated | A pre-PFAD record points to the absent framework or claims its actual structures. | Create a current intended-result description and one proposal episteme; wait for PFAD and realization before architecture-description use. |
| Claim wrapper collection | Every candidate organization claim becomes another episteme. | Keep typed claim nodes in the proposal's one ClaimGraph unless a separately grounded claim episteme has its own EoC and use. |
| Proposal layout as subject organization | Headings or ClaimGraph organization are treated as the proposed framework organization. | Recover described position kinds, proposed subject relation signatures, constraints, invariants, dependency directions, alternatives, basis, and questions. |
| Coverage and acceptance union | One field mixes coverage criterion with WorkPlan acceptance target. | Keep the coverage node complete and cite the plan target separately. |
| Availability as relevance | A missing dependency is assumed blocking, or an available dependency is assumed current for next use. | Fill availability and use relevance independently; only the exact combined state determines the next-use consequence. |
| Local grounding bridge | Unequal proposal and description grounding is admitted to avoid returning. | Stop and return to C.2.1 and A.6.2; add F.9 only for an actual cross-context bridge. |

Adoption risk tripwires:

| Risk | Early repair |
| --- | --- |
| Public name settles before the kind is settled. | Keep the intake name as a source alias and route durable naming through `F.18`. |
| Generated or searched material is trusted because it uses familiar FPF words. | Admit the carrier through `C.35`, then decide selected use through `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR`, or the pattern governing that use. |
| Core, domain, or local edition changes but old users keep following stale guidance. | Add dependency, compatibility, migration, deprecation, supersession, and refresh records through `E.4.PFR` and `G.11`. |
| Enterprise evidence is confidential or proprietary. | Publish a safe local carrier while keeping internal source packs, examples, role assignments, and approval evidence under an explicit local stewardship assignment. |
| No assigned steward can answer whether the framework is current, adopted, or broken in use. | Assign steward roles for the framework edition, source pack, relation records, local publication, quality evidence, and refresh plan. |
| Reader errors and skipped records are treated as training noise. | Treat repeated misuse as adoption telemetry and route it to `E.23` improvement or `G.11` refresh. |
| Compatibility debt hides behind a version label or package manifest. | Record the impacted relations, compatibility boundary, migration work, and blocked runtime or build reading in `E.4.PFR`. |

### E.4.DPF:9 - Consequences

The authoring spine adds overhead before a local framework becomes durable. That overhead prevents hidden source loss, hidden Core change, hidden relation semantics, and hidden currentness debt.

The pattern also makes local publication more useful. Readers get a coherent publication or practical-use carrier, while maintainers can still inspect the framework edition, source pack, relation records, decision records, and quality route.

### E.4.DPF:10 - Rationale

Domain and local frameworks are not mere subsets of FPF. They are FPF-grounded framework editions in bounded contexts. They need domain source work, FPF authoring discipline, architecture decisions, relation records, quality loops, and refresh routes.

Its contribution is the condition-governed authoring spine and the rule that each produced result has an exact receiving use and a pattern governing that use relation.

### E.4.DPF:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Claim | Exact source ref and status | Pattern content changed | Adoption status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A DPF needs one evolutionary authoring line that keeps source use, architecture settlement, pattern methods, relation and edition records, reader access, evaluation, improvement, and currentness distinct but connected. | Current FPF `G.2`, `E.4.PFAD`, `E.8`, `E.4.PFR`, `E.11`, `E.17`, `E.4.DPF.DA`, `E.21`, `E.23`, and `G.11`, current governing practice line for this pattern. | The entire Solution spine, proportional-apparatus ladder, local repair map, exact first-result branches, carrier boundaries, and quality and currentness exits are composed from these direct patterns rather than from one external framework-development lifecycle. | Adopt as the governing line. Recheck this row when any named FPF pattern changes its governed object, result, or boundary; an external source does not override the direct FPF owner by vocabulary similarity. |
| Language artifacts and their examples co-evolve, and missing examples weaken practical use and evolution work. | Zhang, Struber, Hebig, `Development and Evolution of Xtext-based DSLs on GitHub: An Empirical Investigation`, arXiv:2501.19222, 2025 empirical study of 226 developed Xtext languages across 18 application domains, `https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19222`. | The source-pack, pattern-drafting, worked-case, heterogeneous-transfer, relation-and-edition, and local-repair steps keep examples and related artifacts current with the framework instead of publishing only names or definitions. | Adapt the observed co-evolution pressure. The study concerns software DSL repositories and grammar-driven or metamodel-driven development; it does not make a DPF a language grammar, parser, metamodel, or code-generator project. |
| Reusable core and domain variation need explicit dependency, migration, tooling, and adoption work rather than clone-and-own packages. | Nazar, `Software Product Line Engineering: Adoption, Tooling and AI Era Challenges`, arXiv:2605.21353, 2026 single-author survey preprint synthesizing SPLE foundations, adoption models, tooling, variability-aware DevOps, empirical gaps, and AI-era challenges, `https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.21353`. | Architecture decision, E.4.PFR dependency and compatibility relations, Core-to-DPF direction, proportional carrier separation, and edition-change repair keep FPF Core, domain frameworks, and local frameworks distinct and migratable. | Adapt reusable-core, variation, migration, and adoption concerns. The source is software-product-line specific and survey-level; feature models, lifecycle schemes, product-line economics, and software tooling do not become default DPF ontology or authoring order. |
| Pattern candidates need systematic validation pressure and use in practice, not only memorable problem-solution prose or a rule-of-three claim. | Riehle, Harutyunyan, Barcomb, `Pattern Discovery and Validation Using Scientific Research Methods`, arXiv:2107.06065, 2021 method paper with three exploratory studies, `https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06065`; Iba, `Pattern Languages as Media for the Creative Society`, arXiv:1308.1178, 2013 historical lineage for pattern languages as practice media, `https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1178`. | E.8 drafting, E.21 evaluation, heterogeneous cases, seed-versus-reliance boundary, and E.23 improvement replace rule-of-three confidence with declared FPF evaluation and repair. Local mantras remain attentional aids to a full Solution rather than substitutes for pattern validation. | Adapt qualitative survey, action-research, case-study, and practice-media pressure where suitable. The 2021 studies are exploratory and the 2013 paper is lineage, not current governing evidence; current FPF evaluation patterns decide adequacy for the declared use. |

### E.4.DPF:End
