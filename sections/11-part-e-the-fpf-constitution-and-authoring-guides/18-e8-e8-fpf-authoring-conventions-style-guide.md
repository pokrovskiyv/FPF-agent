## E.8 - FPF Authoring Conventions & Style Guide

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)

### E.8:0 - Use this when

Use `E.8` when you are writing, revising, or reviewing one FPF pattern and need to know what shape, voice, reader-recognition role, and assurance material the pattern must carry before it can be treated as mature FPF text.

Use it especially when a draft is technically correct but hard to use: the cold reader cannot tell when to apply it, what action to take, what mistake that action prevents, which related pattern governs a specific outside claim, or which assurance material is informative rather than the first user-facing guidance.

**Not this pattern when.** Use `E.9` when the main work is deciding why FPF should change and how that decision is distributed across patterns. Use `E.19` when the main work is an admission or refresh review. Use the local domain pattern when the question is what FPF says inside that domain rather than how a pattern should be authored.

### E.8:0.1 - What goes wrong if missed

A pattern can satisfy a checklist and still be practically unreadable. It may open with package architecture instead of a recognisable working moment, bury its payoff, hide the pattern that governs a specific outside claim, or let assurance prose silently replace the reader-facing claim. The result is a formally neat text that authors can defend but practitioners cannot reliably use.

### E.8:0.2 - What this buys

`E.8` gives FPF authors one shared pattern shape and one shared authoring discipline: recognition text first, assurance text second, canonical sections present, terminology kept stable, SoTA used as current practice grounding rather than decoration, and practical consequences visible before a reader has to reconstruct the architecture.

**First useful move.** Put the working situation, first action-guiding move, practical payoff, ordinary boundary, and nearest heavier assurance condition into the recognition text before tightening template details or conformance material.

**Move wording in pattern prose.** In `E.8`, phrases such as `first useful move`, `action-guiding move`, or `working move` are reader-facing guidance phrases. They do not create a root `U.Move` or a local pattern-application ontology. When the phrase itself becomes load-bearing, recover the governed value: usually `PatternUseRecommendation@Context` or `PatternUseSequence@Context` under `E.11.PUR`, or a direct work, plan, gate, transformation, publication, architecture, source, or language-state relation under its own governing pattern. Use `E.10.MOVE` when the text cannot tell which value is current.

**Cheap stop.** If the draft already gives a cold reader the working situation, first useful move, practical payoff, ordinary boundary, and nearest heavier assurance condition, do not add more authoring apparatus just to look mature. Use conformance material to verify that guidance; do not let it replace the guidance.

**FPF-governed wording extension.** Add heavier assurance, conformance, SoTA grounding, relation material, or related-pattern material only when the light recognition text would leave a false claim, unstable primary `EntityOfConcern`, hidden governing pattern for a specific claim, relation, or boundary, unbacked practical payoff, or misleading admissible use.

When an authoring pass claims quality improvement rather than ordinary drafting, keep these pattern responsibilities distinct: `E.22` frames the improvement-oriented quality-evaluation question, the object-under-improvement evaluation such as `E.21` or `E.9.DA` supplies value meanings and stop meanings, `C.16.Q` repairs overloaded quality and evaluative-characterization wording, `C.25` carries engineering quality-family endpoints when those endpoints are claimed, and `E.23` governs any repeated quality-improvement method. Closing checklist rows or satisfying a review profile is not by itself quality improvement.

When a pattern claims practical payoff or uses a score, coordinate value, checklist result, benchmark, projection signal, review result, or release posture as evidence of value, name the intended value and the visible proxy relation. If the visible proxy is being treated as the value itself, apply `E.13` and repair the proxy-to-value substitution before the payoff claim is admitted.


**Quality or projection evidence placement.** Pattern-quality status, corpus projection, README, ToC, `E.11`, and `I.2` alignment, card or retrieval evidence, cold-reader evidence, monolith parity, landing evidence, developer, reviewer, and executor correspondence, and other quality-carrier facts belong in the evaluation result, review run record, projection carrier, or release or landing evidence carrier. They do not belong anywhere in the pattern itself, including notes, appendices, `Relations`, `Rationale`, `SoTA-Echoing`, examples, tables, and checklist rows, unless the pattern's own `EntityOfConcern` and intended-reader use are that evaluation or projection work. Part E patterns may govern FPF-pattern authoring, review, evaluation, entry, or publication when that is their declared EntityOfConcern; that authoring scope does not admit rules or rationale about developing that same pattern version. This is a role test, not a lexical test: the same word may be user-facing content in an evaluation pattern and carrier leakage when it reports quality, landing, projection, or role-turn state for this pattern.

**Pattern roles across coupled flows.** In authoring guidance, speak at the pattern level. One pattern may be the pattern of concern for different roles in different flows: an author repairs it, `E.21` evaluates it, `E.19` admits or refreshes it, a practitioner selects and uses it, and a later evaluator may reopen it. Those flows may be joined in one `TransformationFlowStructure` through transfer, feedback, return, projection, landing, edition-change, or repair relations, but their roles and `EntityOfConcern` assignments stay distinct. The pattern itself also carries its own primary `EntityOfConcern`: the subject its Problem, Solution, or guidance is about. Development-flow evidence may cause rewrites, but reviewer and executor exchange, status, projection proof, landing proof, and use-found evidence remain in their carriers rather than entering the pattern as if they were guidance for the intended reader. This is the pattern-authoring instance of the broader transformation-flow and P2W coupled-flow rule: a publication, principle scheme, work plan, or self-evolving specification flow may help create or govern later work without becoming the performed work, project evidence, gate passage, assurance, edition bump, or applied-edition content.

**Maturity rule.** Section completeness is not pattern maturity. A pattern matures when its `Problem frame`, `Solution`, worked cases, boundaries, and conformance checks all point to the same usable action guidance.

**Primary EntityOfConcern in plain terms.** The primary `EntityOfConcern` of `E.8` is the authored FPF pattern: its canonical sections, reader-recognition role, wording discipline, examples, rationale, anti-patterns, SoTA-Echoing, and relations.

**Primary working reader.** The first reader is an FPF author or reviewer shaping pattern prose for later practitioners and managers. The downstream practitioner is the reader the pattern must ultimately serve, so the authoring guide must model the same recognition discipline it requires.

### E.8:0.3 - Pattern Kind In Plain Terms

An FPF pattern is an action-guiding method description for a recurring working situation. It is applied by an intended FPF user who recognizes the situation, understands the problem and forces, and then uses the `Solution` to decide what to do, what to stabilize, what to avoid, and what practical change should follow.

Pattern application is the user-side act: the user recognizes the working situation, applies the pattern, and uses the `Solution` to shape the next admissible use. Its `Problem frame`, `Problem`, `Forces`, `Solution`, `Consequences`, worked slices, and anti-patterns carry the guidance. Its `Conformance Checklist` checks whether that guidance has been applied and authored correctly; it must not replace the `Solution` or turn the pattern into a control form.

The primary content-bearing job is constructive method guidance: the pattern must say what the user should do so the recurring error does not arise. Error prevention, auditability, and conformance checks are evidence that the guidance is usable; they are not the pattern's center. The first substantive content in the opening `Problem frame` and `Solution` must be a positive subject spine: the primary `EntityOfConcern` kind, the first admissible action-guiding move, the practical delta, and the few boundaries needed for that first move. The text must not replace subject content with repeated guards, distinctions, related-pattern mappings, references, mini-rules, definitions, caveats, architecture rationale, or quality or projection evidence unless the repetition adds a new local action, case, evidence value for the user, or first-reading recognition need. Copying distinctions owned by other patterns into this pattern as repeated "do not confuse our EoC with their EoC" prose is the same repetition problem. Boundary doctrine is pattern content like any other doctrine: if strict distinction, non-use, ToC navigation, or the governing pattern for a claim, relation, or boundary already carries the distinction, do not repeat it locally. Use one short pattern id or governing-pattern statement when needed. Add local boundary prose only when it states a documented local confusion and exact stop condition that the owning pattern does not already carry. The repair is to say clearly what this pattern's own `EntityOfConcern` is, not to enumerate the unbounded set of other things it is not.

The same rule blocks pattern-application drift for any FPF object, not only for patterns. Name the object by its FPF kind when the kind is known: a pattern is a pattern, a claim is a claim, a relation is a relation, a row is a row, a source is a source, a publication is a publication, a WorkPlan is a WorkPlan, and so on. FPF patterns are applied to situations, claims, texts, or work objects. Use `governing pattern` only in the typed form `governing pattern for <claim, relation, or boundary>` when one pattern actually governs that specific item; use `related pattern` for a looser pattern relation; use `relation` only for the relation itself. A compact pattern-reference sentence should be declarative: this pattern applies to `<situation, claim, or object>`, this claim is governed by `<pattern id>`, this relation is recorded in `Relations`, this entry cue belongs in README, ToC, `E.11`, `I.2`, or a retrieval or projection carrier, or this pattern application stops under `<condition>`. Relations are positive claims, not catalogs of absent relations. Detailed discoverability belongs in README, ToC query cues, `E.11`, `I.2`, or retrieval or projection carriers; compact related-pattern statements belong late in `Relations` after the positive subject and action spine. Ordinary references use ordinary reference forms: a pattern id in prose, a citation, `Builds on`, `Coordinates with`, `Relations`, ToC, README, `E.11`, or `I.2`. They are also not repeated as many conditional sentences or small variants when one compact definition, boundary, table, `Relations`, ToC, README, `E.11`, `I.2`, or retrieval or projection locus already carries the same content family.

Treat precision-restoration problems in pattern prose as one profile with five layers: word, head, and use precision; phrase apparatus; repetition and distribution; role and carrier separation; and pattern application. Do not add a local row for each new symptom. `E.8` requires the author to keep the positive subject and action spine first; `F.19` repairs phrase-level apparatus; `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `F.18`, or the governing pattern repairs remaining word, head, and use precision; `E.21` measures the collapsed effect on pattern quality.

A wording cleanup is kind-preserving by default. Before an author accepts a changed FPF-governed phrase as a repair, the pre-repair and post-repair `EntityOfConcern`, kind, relation or claim kind, current ontic slot, relation position, use relation, or claim kind, admissible use, and scope must be recoverable when those items are live. This is a bounded complete preservation check, not an order to formalize ordinary prose or unchanged text and not permission to choose "no edit" as the easy minimum. Leaving text unchanged closes only when the phrase is `not triggered`, ordinary prose, or already satisfied by value with loci; otherwise the finding remains open. Removing a trigger word or replacing a generic head is not a repair when it changes the ontology: for example, a graph-shaped method cue must not be narrowed into a work sequence unless an accepted decision explicitly changes the kind and consequences. If a relation, signature, mathematical-lens, role, method, work, or evidence position is live, the author cites the governing pattern for that position instead of restating its ontology in `E.8`. If the phrase hides several kinds, split them or assign the decision to the governing pattern or `DRR`; do not flatten them into one cleaner-looking word.

For boilerplate overwrap, follow `F.19`. `E.8` adds only the pattern-authoring placement rule: after boilerplate is removed or moved and remaining content is precision-restored under `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `F.18`, or the governing pattern when needed, pattern prose keeps only the intended user's admissible move and boundary. Process, architecture, review, quality, projection, and release evidence stay in their own carriers unless they are rewritten as that user-facing move.

When an action-adjacent pattern classifies wording, a name, a publication face, an explanation class, a comparison unit, or another semio-facing object, that classification is only useful if it connects back to action guidance. The pattern must say what use or action is admissible now, what related use or action is not admissible under the current pattern, and which FPF pattern governs the case when the claim is a work, evidence, gate, decision, assurance, engineering-justification, release, or reliance claim.

`Semio-Echoing` is admissible only as a trigger-controlled auxiliary placement. Use it when `E.10`, `C.2.P`, or `E.10.ARCH` has exposed a wording-use overread whose EntityOfConcern, episteme/publication stack, alignment basis, and remaining admissible reader use are recoverable by value. Do not add it as a generic warning block. In non-semio patterns the primary content remains the pattern's own `EntityOfConcern` and admissible use; semio material stays as a thin cue, related-pattern relation named by value, local recovery line, or named description and publication-use boundary section unless it changes that use or blocks a documented overread. If the material mainly says that a description, view, publication, record, card, diagram, source, or file is not a permission, promise, prescription, evidence item, assurance verdict, decision, gate passage, release, work occurrence, or authority source, keep it out of the subject Solution and put it in that boundary section or in the exact description-publication pattern.

### E.8:1 - Problem frame
FPF grows through the addition of patterns written by authors from many
disciplines. Without a shared structure *and* voice, the framework would
fracture, violating Pillars **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** and
**P‑2 Didactic Primacy**.

### E.8:2 - Problem
*Structural drift* and *stylistic fragmentation* threaten three qualities:

1. **Comparability** – readers cannot align patterns lacking common
   headings.
2. **Narrative cohesion** – prose swings from dry jargon to informal
   blog style.
3. **Reviewability after guidance** – missing sections hide boundary and assurance checks
   (Archetypal Grounding, Bias‑Annotation) that let reviewers verify the action guidance without replacing it.

### E.8:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Uniformity vs Expressiveness** | Consistent template ↔ freedom for diverse domains. |
| **Rigor vs Readability** | Formal precision ↔ engaging prose. |
| **Brevity vs Completeness** | Concise patterns ↔ mandated safety subsections. |

### E.8:4 - Solution — One template, enriched by style principles

#### E.8:4.1 - Canonical Pattern Template
Within each pattern, the **canonical** section headings **SHALL** appear in the order below.
For each **canonical content section heading (1–12)**, the `<Title>` component (after the heading separator, e.g. ` - `) **MUST** start with the canonical section title (case-insensitive match; canonical capitalisation preferred); an optional clarifier after an em dash is allowed (e.g., `Solution — …`).
The **Footer marker** (section **13**, if present) is a sentinel and is governed by **H-9** rather than the standard `<FullId> - <Title>` shape.

**Extensibility.**
Authors **MAY** add additional sections. Prefer expressing them as subsections under the nearest canonical section (e.g., `4.1`, `4.1.1` under *Solution*). If an additional pattern-level section is necessary, it **MUST NOT** delete or reorder the canonical sections and its title **MUST NOT** shadow a canonical title.

**Mandatory vs optional.**
* Canonical sections **1–13** are mandatory in every pattern.
* Canonical sections carry content. Authors must not use omission placeholders as section substitutes; when a section is intrinsically small, write the smallest content-bearing grounding, misuse, boundary, or reduced-case statement that preserves the section's role.
* **First substantive authoring seed.** The first non-empty authored body of a pattern **SHALL** already instantiate the canonical section frame by value: title line, header block, canonical sections **1–13**, and the footer marker.
* Recognition-role openings and first-minute working guidance belong **inside** that canonical frame. Any retained pre-template entry material must also stay inside that same canonical frame rather than appearing as one pre-template opening memo. Authors **MUST NOT** seed one pre-template opening memo and postpone canonical sectioning, `Conformance Checklist`, or footer-marker installation to one separate `E.19`, assembly, or review-repair pass.

**Template:**
- **Title line:** Hashes + FullId + ` - ` + Pattern Title; optional `(informative)` note.
- **Header block:** Type, Status; optional Normativity override.
1. **Problem frame**
2. **Problem**
3. **Forces**
4. **Solution**
5. **Archetypal Grounding** (Tell-Show-Show; at least one content-bearing grounding slice, reduced grounding case, or ordinary/non-use boundary)
6. **Bias‑Annotation**
7. **Conformance Checklist**
8. **Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them** (at least one local misuse, overread, or exact boundary case; no placeholder)
9. **Consequences**
10. **Rationale**
11. **SoTA-Echoing** (post-2015 practice alignment; terminology drift and deltas; full comparison or reduced SoTA required whenever external or internal practice changes the Solution)
12. **Relations**
13. **Footer marker**

**Footer marker.** End each pattern with a single visible sentinel heading line by itself: `### <PatternId>:End`. This makes truncation detectable even when HTML comments are stripped or surfaced by editors. The footer marker is intentionally content‑free: **do not** place prose under it.

*Note.* Pattern boundaries are still parseable by scanning for the next pattern heading (`## …`), but an explicit `:End` marker helps retrieval pipelines (and LLM prompts) distinguish “this chunk is the whole pattern” from “this chunk was cut mid‑pattern”.

##### E.8:4.1.1 - Heading & ID discipline (human tooling + retrieval)
FPF is often consumed through full‑text search and retrieval (RAG). A reader or an LLM may see a subsection without its parent headings, so headings must be **self‑identifying**.

**H-1 (Heading shape).** Every pattern heading and every subsection heading inside a pattern **SHALL** follow:
`<hashes> <FullId> - <Title> (optional note of non‑normativity)`

*Exception.* The **Footer marker** is a sentinel heading and is governed by **H-9**, not by the standard `<FullId> - <Title>` shape.

**H-2 (Heading separator).** The canonical separator between `<FullId>` and `<Title>` is ` - ` (ASCII, space-hyphen-space).
Previously authored text may use Unicode dash variants such as ` – ` or ` — ` as separators; tooling **SHOULD** treat those variants as migration candidates, and authors **SHOULD** migrate touched headings to ` - `.

**H-3 (FullId).** `FullId` is the full hierarchical address.
For a **pattern heading** it is the pattern ID (e.g., `A.2`, `E.10.D1`).
For **headings inside a pattern**, append dot‑separated ordinal section numbers after the colon (`:`) (e.g., `A.2:4.4`, `E.10.D2:3`).
*Exception:* the Footer marker uses the reserved sentinel token `:End` as defined in **H-9**.
The colon (`:`) is **reserved** for section paths and **MUST NOT** appear in pattern IDs.

**H-4 (Ordinals).** Ordinals in section paths **SHOULD** track the canonical template numbering (**1 = Problem frame**, …, **13 = Footer marker**) to maximise cross‑pattern comparability. During refactors or in previously authored patterns, ordinals **MAY** be local. In that case, the **canonical section title at the start of `<Title>`** is the semantic key; readers and tools **MUST NOT** infer section semantics from the ordinal alone.
*Note:* the Footer marker itself is exempt from ordinal encoding; it uses the reserved token `:End` (see **H-9**).

**H-5 (Where kind and normativity are declared).** Pattern **kind** (for example, Architectural or Definitional) **MUST** be declared in the **Header block**, not encoded into the heading text. Normativity (**normative** or **informative**) **MUST** also be declared in the Header block when it deviates from the default. If a reminder is needed for readers, authors **MAY** add a short parenthetical note at the end of the heading, for example `(informative)` or `(non‑normative)`, but headings **MUST NOT** use square‑bracket tags.

**H-6 (Heading levels).** Heading levels **MUST** preserve a fixed offset between structural layers (Part or Cluster (flat) → Pattern → Pattern sections):
* Part and Cluster headings **MUST** use `#` (level 1) across the file.
* A Pattern heading **MUST** use `##` (level 2).
* Inside a pattern, each nested section **MUST** add exactly one `#` per level (e.g., `## A.2 - …`, `### A.2:2 - …`, `#### A.2:2.1 - …`).

**H-7 (Ellipsis discipline).** Authors **MUST NOT** use **three consecutive full stops/dots** (`...`) as punctuation in headings or narrative prose. Authors **MUST** use the Unicode ellipsis `…` (U+2026) instead. For editorial elisions in quotations, authors **SHOULD** prefer `[…]` to make the omission explicit and distinguish it from retrieval truncation.
*Exception:* literal three‑dot sequences that are part of an external language’s syntax **MAY** appear **only inside code spans or fenced code blocks**.

**H-8 (Normative keywords).** The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, as clarified by RFC 8174 (only when capitalised). Authors **SHOULD** avoid informal deontic phrasing (“need to”, “is required to”) in normative clauses.

**Deontics vs admissibility.** Use RFC keywords only for **deontic obligations** (requirements on authors, reviewers, implementers/tooling, or published pattern or companion texts) — i.e., things an agent can choose to do or omit. Do **not** use RFC keywords to state **definitions**, **structural invariants**, **typing rules**, or other **admissibility conditions** of the modeled world.

When you need an enforceable constraint that is *mathematical* rather than *deontic*, express it as a non‑deontic predicate using one of: `Definition:`, `Invariant:`, or `Well‑formedness constraint:` (optionally with formal quantifiers). Prefer mathematical terms like `cardinality 1..1 (total)`, `0..1 (partial)`, or `0..n` over deontic adjectives like “mandatory or optional” when the intent is cardinality, not duty.

**Admissibility predicate discipline (recommended shape).**
When expressing admissibility or validity constraints as predicates (`Definition:`, `Invariant:`, or `Well‑formedness constraint:`):
* Authors **MUST NOT** use RFC keywords inside the predicate block.
* Authors **SHOULD** give each predicate a stable identifier and short name (e.g., `RA‑1 (Locality)`, `RE‑3 (Method gate)`), so that Conformance Checklist items can reference it without re‑authoring the rule.
* Authors **SHOULD** write the constraint as a declarative predicate (optionally quantified), e.g., `role ∈ Roles(context)`, rather than as “X MUST …”.
* If the constraint needs to be checked as part of pattern conformance, authors **SHOULD** reference the predicate identifier from the Conformance Checklist, and call out validator behaviour when relevant, rather than duplicating the predicate with RFC keywords.

**H-9 (Footer marker sentinel).** Footer marker **SHALL** be a single heading line whose `FullId` is the pattern ID followed by the reserved sentinel token `:End` (no ordinals, no title, no square‑bracket tags):
`### <PatternId>:End`
It is the only allowed heading *inside* a pattern whose section token is non‑numeric. It **MUST** be the final line of the pattern and **MUST NOT** carry any prose. Tooling and readers **MUST** treat it as a boundary sentinel, not as a semantic section.

*Unification note:* historic A‑ and D‑templates differed only by the presence/absence of **Bias‑Annotation** and **Relations**; the unified template keeps the headings everywhere and requires every heading to carry content-bearing grounding, boundary, consequence, rationale, source-use, relation, or reduced-case material rather than an omission placeholder.
The Alexandrian pattern canon historically calls *Problem frame* “Context”. FPF avoids that label because **Context** is already overloaded in FPF (e.g., `U.BoundedContext` and its Plain‑register label).

#### E.8:4.2 - Stylistic Principles (S-0 ... S-19)

| # | Principle | Guideline |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| S-0 | Narrative Flow Seven-Step Heuristic | Authors are encouraged to structure major paragraphs or subsections using the seven-step mnemonic. |
| S-1 | Density without Jargon | Short declarative sentences; tool names belong in Pedagogy/Tooling. |
| S-2 | Internal Cohesion | Inline references to Pillars and related patterns. |
| S-3 | Embedded Mini-Definitions | Gloss a new term in parentheses on first appearance. |
| S-4 | Contextualisation | Brief historical or disciplinary lineage references. |
| S-5 | Prophylactic Clarification | Pre-empt common misreadings inside the prose. |
| S-6 | Quotable Closers | Finish Solution or Consequences with a memorable aphorism. |
| S-7 | Generative over Prescriptive | Present rules as enabling constraints, not bureaucracy. |
| S-8 | Trans-disciplinary Tie-ins | Illustrate using at least two distinct fields. |
| S-9 | Physical Grounding Reference | Link abstractions to a `Transformer` or physical process. |
| S-10 | Punchy Blocks | <= 5 sentences per paragraph; lists for clarity. |
| S-11 | Narrative Flow | Ensure sections read as a continuous story, not bullet soup. |
| S-12 | Full sentences over tags | Avoid “keyword soup”. Each list item SHOULD contain a subject and a verb; prefer 2-4 sentence micro-paragraphs to bare tag lists. |
| S-13 | SoTA-Echo structure | In the SoTA-Echoing section, present: **claim -> practice -> source -> alignment -> adoption status (adopt/adapt/reject)**; cite Bridges & CL when crossing Contexts/ReferencePlanes. |
| S-14 | Didactic-content sufficiency | New and substantially revised patterns carry enough didactic content to be teachable without nearby project notes. |
| S-15 | Worked slices over scenario labels | Transform-like families show at least one concrete source and resulting-publication slice; scenario names alone are not enough. |
| S-16 | Ordinary vs FPF-governed wording realism | Keep ordinary use light, and make heavier review records explicit only for disputed, high-risk, or higher-impact cases. |
| S-17 | Self-contained monolith prose | A merged pattern must explain itself inside the monolith; planning shorthand and review-context dependencies are not admissible in pattern prose. |
| S-18 | Reader-role discipline | Keep every pattern host or monolith section addressed to the intended FPF user; move package-development, architecture-placement rationale, developer, reviewer, and executor correspondence, and quality or projection evidence to separate companion, evaluation, review, projection, or release carriers unless the sentence has been rewritten as the user's admissible move or boundary. |
| S-19 | Precision before relaxation | In FPF-governed prose, restore the head kind named by a generic phrase before treating any qualifier as trustworthy claim guidance; then restore the claim kind or admissible-use boundary hidden in the qualifier before allowing any later plain, didactic, or coarsened restatement. |

Authors use the principles as a *scaffold*, not a straitjacket: the goal
is coherent, engaging insight. Engagement remains subordinate to semantic discipline: hooks, quotable lines, Plain restatements, and didactic images may improve recognition, but any ontological, evidence, causal, assurance, bridge, gate, work, decision, or admissibility claim kind or admissible-use boundary they carry must be recoverable through the governed Tech reading or named neighboring pattern. Ordinary Plain prose without that claim kind or admissible-use boundary stays ordinary prose.

**S-0 (Narrative Flow Seven-Step Heuristic) — explanation**
Narrative flow is recommended to follow these steps: **Hook -> Frame -> Weave -> Ground -> Bridge -> Flow -> Close**.

Brief explanations:
| Step       | Purpose in a paragraph/section                             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hook**   | Open attention with a vivid but bounded image or paradox that maps back to the primary `EntityOfConcern` and claim. |
| **Frame**  | State the specific question or problem space.              |
| **Weave**  | Connect to earlier patterns or Pillars.                    |
| **Ground** | Tie to a concrete system, episteme, or physical process.     |
| **Bridge** | Show the implication for the upcoming claim or rule.       |
| **Flow**   | Deliver the formal content or argument.                    |
| **Close**  | End with a quotable line or payoff that reinforces memory. |

Narrative Flow Heuristic also operationalises S-1 (Density w/o Jargon), S-2 (Internal Cohesion), S-4 (Contextualisation), and S-6 (Quotable Closers).

#### E.8:4.2.1 - Recognition text and assurance text
Every canonical pattern SHALL stabilise one primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, or claim record early enough that a cold reader can tell what kind of thing the pattern is actually governing. If ordinary forms vary (`note`, `sheet`, `guided UI`, `rendering`, `review aid`), the text must make explicit which of those are merely presentation forms of one primary selected EntityOfConcern, relation, or claim and which would instead name a different act, process, work-result record, or governing companion. Recognition and assurance texts may refine that selected item differently, but they must not silently swap the central kind.

If a pattern uses a broad umbrella or head together with a narrower operative branch, the text must also make the stack explicit early enough for first reading: what the broad head names, what the current narrowed branch is, what primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, or claim record is actually in play, what governed action is being carried by that object, and what wider work or process remains outside the pattern. A qualifier alone does not restore that stack.

Under `F.18` local-first naming, the canonical pair here is **recognition text** and **assurance text**.
The earlier provisional `recognition shell` and `assurance shell` wording is retired.
These names refer to two reading-order roles carried by existing sections or projections inside one pattern; they do **not** mint new `authoritySourceRef` targets, governing-pattern relations, publication-form/face kinds, `publication-face kind`s, or a second face family.
A third didactic-content role remains optional and is justified only when the family is especially easy to misuse, easy to over-read, or hard to teach without extra scaffolding.

The **recognition text** is the first-reading text.
It is the part of the pattern that lets a cold working reader recognise the situation quickly enough to decide whether to keep reading.
It should start from a subject-domain or practice moment before internal taxonomy whenever the pattern is meant to help real work rather than only internal canon maintenance.
In practice it usually appears in an early `Use this when` line or equivalent opening, plus the upper parts of `Problem frame`, `Problem`, `Solution`, `Consequences`, and nearby worked slices.
Its job is to make visible:
- what ordinary working situation this pattern is for;
- what goes wrong if the pattern is missed;
- what the pattern buys the reader in practice;
- when this is not the right pattern;
- what primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, or claim record is actually being kept stable;
- and, when technical terms must appear early, a pairwise plain gloss for each early FPF-governed technical term.

The **assurance text** is the second-reading text.
It carries the heavier FPF-governed material that makes the pattern reviewable and auditable:
- declaration blocks and typed fields when those are part of the pattern's declared conformance or boundary claim;
- representation ontology, EntityOfConcern discipline, or primary-EntityOfConcern discipline;
- any minimal modeling or mathematical lens that keeps the primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, or claim record stable;
- guidance or check material, invariants, admissibility, and stop or neighbouring-pattern conditions;
- `SoTA-Echoing` when it carries explanatory work;
- and the review hooks that let a broader or more consequential interpretation or use be checked explicitly.

The assurance text may sharpen, justify, and discipline the recognition text.
It must **not** silently replace, strengthen, or universalize the claim that the recognition text made visible.
If the recognition text says “this pattern helps with a bounded working situation”, the assurance text must not quietly turn that into an unbacked carrier claim, unbacked guarantee, or broader universality claim.

If a pattern claims **universal** or **transdisciplinary** status, that claim must already be visible in the recognition text.
It is not enough for universality to appear only later in a guidance or check sheet, declaration block, or `SoTA-Echoing` rationale.
A broad claim should therefore be demonstrated in the recognition text through at least **three heterogeneous reader or domain situations**.
When a compact matrix helps, `F.16` is the preferred template for showing that breadth.
If `SoTA-Echoing` carries an FPF-governed claim, the practical implication of those rows should be recoverable from the recognition text and case bank rather than remaining a late-only justification layer.

A **third didactic-content role** means enough didactic and operational content that the pattern survives without nearby project documents. Typical indicators include:
- at least one concrete source and resulting-publication slice in Archetypal Grounding when the pattern governs transforms or publication change;
- at least one boundary-heavy example or anti-example when nearby patterns or other governing companion roles are easy to confuse;
- reviewer guidance that tells what to inspect first and which neighboring FPF pattern governs the failure mode and which project-side FPF kind and reference named by value carries the claim or effect;
- local mini-definitions or glossary material for recurring terms that would otherwise be recovered only from project context.

Pattern density is therefore not “more metadata” and not “longer tag lists”. It is the presence of enough recognition, assurance, and, when needed, extra didactic material that a reader can understand the pattern, apply it lightly in ordinary cases, and recognise when a heavier review profile is required.

#### E.8:4.2.2 - Package-form and governing-pattern relation role-word discipline

FPF pattern prose is not free-form descriptive English. When authors name a *package-form* or a *governing-pattern relation*, they must use role words with stable semantic intent.

Use the following distinctions explicitly:

This is a cross-cutting review discipline, not a replacement for local pattern lexica. For example, `A.6.7` and `A.19.CHR` already carry the suite, kit, and pack distinction, and `E.17.1` already carries the viewpoint bundle, family, and library distinction.
- **governing pattern** = the pattern that carries the primary guidance or check authority of the family;
- **specialization** = a named refinement under an existing governing pattern;
- **overlay** = a cross-cutting governance role or reading-order projection over existing governing patterns;
- **profile** = a declarative review/use role derived from a governing pattern rather than a replacement pattern;
- **family** = a recurring class of cases governed by one pattern or governing companion;
- **bundle** = a packaged set of defaults, allowances, or coordinated members;
- **cluster** = a navigation or reading-order grouping; not by itself a governing-pattern claim;
- **suite** = a coordinated set of members with explicit suite semantics under the governing FPF pattern or named authority reference;
- **pack** = an editorial or review grouping, not automatically a semantic-authority claim;
- **kit** = a reusable coordinated publication or boundary-description package with kit-level semantics under the governing FPF pattern or named authority reference;
- **record** = a case, report, or review record;
- **umbrella** = a provisional or review-stage head spanning possible subfamilies before a final governing FPF pattern, accepted `DRR`, or pattern-body decision.

These words are not interchangeable. In particular, authors must not let `cluster`, `bundle`, `suite`, `family`, `profile`, `overlay`, or `umbrella` do the work of an unnamed governing-pattern relation. When that relation matters, it must be stated directly: `specialization under ...`, `profile governed by ...`, `overlay over ...`, `bundle under ...`, or another equally explicit formulation.

A pattern may reuse a pattern-native role word when that role is already defined by the governing pattern. Outside that case, authors must not improvise near-synonyms or shift between role words for stylistic variety.

##### E.8:4.2.2.1 - Precision-restoration placement discipline

When a pattern or companion text is drafted from `E.10` or `E.10.ARCH`, distinguish two authoring objects:

* **`semanticArea`** is the Part-F semantic unit for a wording-use restoration row: one Concept-Set row, one UTS row, or an explicitly bounded row-set. It is declared with `semanticAreaBaseConcept` and `semanticAreaSenseFamily`.
* **`ontologicalNeighborhood`** is the applicability neighborhood around that named `semanticArea`: nearby primary `EntityOfConcern` kinds, relation kinds, claim records, governing FPF patterns, non-use boundaries, and remaining reader use that can carry the recovered meaning after the wording is repaired.
* **`pattern nest`** is the publication and specialization placement of a pattern under its governing pattern family.

These are not synonyms. A precision-restoration pattern is placed in the pattern nest whose primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation record, or claim record it repairs. Its `semanticArea` states the Part-F semantic unit it repairs, while its `ontologicalNeighborhood` may name several relation governing the asserted uses. For example, quality-term repair lives in the `C.16` characterization nest, even though its neighbouring relations can include relation construction, action invitation, evidence, assurance, source-use assignment, engineering quality bundles, pattern-quality evaluation, or mathematical-lens use.

Affected patterns should use a thin pointer when the first-stage wording repair belongs elsewhere. The pointer names the selected restoration pattern and the condition that triggers it; it does not copy the trigger registry, the full `E.10.ARCH` recovery algorithm, or a second local architecture for the same repair. The affected pattern then keeps its own subject matter: the characteristic, structure, view, episteme, relation, evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, or adequacy question it already governs.

If a draft proposes a new precision-restoration pattern, the authoring claim must show the repeated wording failure, `semanticAreaBaseConcept`, `semanticArea`, `semanticAreaSenseFamily`, the recovered primary `EntityOfConcern` kind or relation/claim record, the intended pattern nest, the neighboring governing relations, and the admissible action left after repair. A new pattern is not justified merely because a word appears often, because a local checklist wants a bucket, or because a campaign needs a tidy grouping.

#### E.8:4.2.3 - Reader-role discipline for pattern prose

A pattern is written for its intended FPF user: the person who will use the pattern to organise thought, inspect a case, publish a note, or review a result under that pattern.
Its FPF-governed sections therefore explain what the pattern lets that user do, what it forbids, what it costs, and how it relates to neighbouring patterns in user terms. When neighbouring patterns or other governing companion roles are named, the prose should answer one user question such as `which neighboring FPF pattern applies`, `which project-side FPF kind and reference named by value carries the claim`, `which nearby pattern is easy to confuse`, or `what must stay coordinated here`; it should not read as one explanatory aside about why the package architecture was split that way.
`E.8` reader and reviewer wording is FPF pattern-authoring wording. Project-side publication readers, explanation readers, comparative review units, and participants in named project-side review relations are governed by the publication or project-side patterns that name those publication units, explanation-use relations, comparative review units, evidence paths, work records, or gate records, such as `E.17`, `E.17.ID.CR`, `E.17.EFP`, `A.10`, `A.15.4`, `A.20`, or `A.21`.

Authors must keep FPF-development or package-architecture material separate from that user-facing body.
In particular, `Problem`, `Solution`, `Consequences`, `Rationale`, worked slices, and ordinary-vs-FPF-governed wording guidance must not do the work of:
- arguing that the material is worth isolating;
- justifying overlay/profile/governing-pattern or authority-reference choice as a package decision;
- discussing authority-reference freeze, naming freeze, merge state, blast radius, or safest landing form;
- or narrating future package promotion or defer decisions.

If architecture-placement commentary is still helpful, the default place is a separate companion note or ADR-like architecture note.
A pattern may include a short optional informative subsection such as `Architectural placement note (informative)` only when that placement materially helps users avoid misuse; even then, it must stay clearly separated from the user-facing solution and rationale rather than replacing them.

#### E.8:4.2.4 - Human-facing fit beyond role correctness
Human-facing fit is also subject-domain fit. A recognition text that starts from internal taxonomy, pattern-placement convenience, or package-architecture wording before the problem-domain moment is still under-authored even if its later guidance or check text is correct. When a broader umbrella name and a narrower operative branch are both used, the recognition text should also tell the reader which stack is actually active rather than leaving that reconstruction to a later declaration block or companion note.

A pattern can already be role-clean, boundary-clean, and reader-role-clean, yet still fail the first minute of use for a cold working reader.
That failure usually appears when the text is admissible but does not yet make the working situation, practical payoff, primary `EntityOfConcern`, non-use boundary, or first action-guiding move visible enough.

**P-2 epistemic precision check.** When `E.10` selects epistemic precision restoration for pattern prose, the first admissible action-guiding move must survive as remaining admissible reader use or be replaced by a neighboring FPF pattern governing that claim application that now carries that claim. This is a direct `E.2` `P-2` and `E.12` requirement, not an optional style preference. Intentional didactic metaphors and vivid Plain recognition lines are admissible when they are ordinary recognition aids or when their claim kind or admissible-use boundary maps back to Tech under `E.10:6.2`. A precision-corrected rewrite that leaves the recognition text inert is still under-authored.

For canonical patterns, the first-reading text should behave as a **recognition text** and the heavier review/check scope should remain in an **assurance text**.

When a pattern claims practice guidance or is meant to be used by engineers, managers, researchers, or other working readers, authors should make the following visible before the heavier harness takes over:
- a recognisable `Use this when` or equivalent first-minute recognition cue;
- a concrete working situation in `Problem frame`, not only taxonomic or pattern-placement language;
- a short statement of what goes wrong if the pattern is missed or misread;
- a short statement of what this pattern buys the reader in practice;
- the first admissible action-guiding move the user should take in that situation;
- a short `Not this pattern when` boundary for ordinary nearby non-use cases;
- one minimally viable worked case or use slice that shows what changes in practice;
- when a typed declaration block, formal lens, or other compact modeling material is FPF-governed, a short user-facing statement of what kind of object the pattern is governing and what minimal lens keeps that object reviewable;
- pairwise plain glosses for any FPF-governed technical terms that must appear before the heavier declaration role arrives;
- when `SoTA-Echoing` carries explanatory work, a short working-reader implication for each row or cluster of rows and a visible link back to the case bank or worked slices that those rows discipline;
- a visible split between the recognition text and the heavier assurance text or companion material;
- and, if the draft implicitly serves several working-reader situations, an explicit primary working reader, primary concern, or primary viewpoint.

**Problem-frame recognition signature (informative).** A canonical pattern should
expose the working situation through its `Problem frame`, not through one
separate navigation block. When an `E.11` pattern-entry discoverability problem
is present, the same `Problem frame` may also carry candidate-pattern and
tempting-wrong-pattern cues; otherwise it should stay with action guidance
rather than becoming a local catalogue row.

The local recognition signature should make recoverable:

- the concrete working situation;
- the primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation named by value, claim record, or stabilized concern;
- what goes wrong if the pattern is missed or misread;
- the first admissible action-guiding move and what that move buys;
- the ordinary not-this-pattern boundary;
- the first admissible action-guiding result; when an `E.11` discoverability
  problem is present, the first admissible entry stop or entry-stabilizing result.

`Use this pattern when`, `This pattern applies when`, or equivalent `Problem
frame` prose may be used as the first sentence or compact cue of this
signature.
It is not one separate required section.
Compact candidate-pattern comparison belongs in `E.11`-distributed entry material; expanded entry-disambiguation cases belong in `I.2`.

If the prose points to neighbouring patterns or other governing companion roles, it should present them as neighboring FPF patterns, project-side FPF kinds and references named by value, or `E.11` entry-recognition reclassifications rather than as hidden co-authorities of the current pattern.

If the pattern claims broad, universal, or transdisciplinary usefulness, that breadth should already be visible in the recognition text.
At minimum the recognition text should show at least three heterogeneous reader or domain situations rather than one narrow case family with a later broad claim attached.
When a compact matrix helps, `F.16` is the preferred template for making that breadth legible.

This is not a request to flatten the pattern into plain language only.
It is a rule about ordering, assurance depth, and text consistency: the recognition text must help a working reader recognise the pattern early, while the assurance text continues to carry the full claim kind or admissible-use boundary.
If the pattern uses technical lexicon, ontological distinctions, or a mathematical lens, those structures must remain recoverable, but the first-reading text should not require the reader to decode that full stack before recognising the working situation.
The assurance text may tighten or discipline the recognition text; it must not silently shift what the recognition text claimed.

**Illustrative migration example (informative).**

Old pre-template top:

```text
Start here when the dominant question is API, protocol, SLA, published boundary, or compliance wording.
First output: Claim Register.
Neighboring pattern relations and entry-recognition reclassifications: A.6.B, A.6.C.
```

Repaired Problem-frame recognition signature:

```text
Use this pattern when boundary-facing language - API, protocol, SLO/SLA, compliance clause, or other published boundary description - mixes guidance or check clauses, admissibility gates, duties, and evidence into one sentence or published boundary description.

If missed, the text becomes boundary-claim soup: runtime behavior, governance, and evidence are treated as one undifferentiated promise.

Do not use this pattern merely because the text mentions an API or boundary description. If the question is still one unstable cue, preserve it through the admissible cue-preservation line first.

First admissible action-guiding result: one `A.6.B`-governed atomic claim set or one Claim Register whose claim/use questions are explicit enough for the governing FPF pattern or named project-side FPF kind and reference to inspect.
```

#### E.8:4.2.5 - Design-time and run-time referents stay separated in pattern prose

Pattern prose must keep its referent index explicit. In ordinary body sections, the default truth-makers are run-time or governed-domain objects, states, moves, boundaries, consequences, and user-facing practical effects. Normative-standard wording is still admissible when the sentence is explicitly about the standard as a normative publication, for example in marked migration navigation examples, marked informative notes, or conformance/checklist clauses.

Design-time and development-state referents are different objects. The current draft, current body, current pass, author, reviewer, handoff, packet, governing companion, landing choice, or other writing-process objects must not be smuggled in as the hidden truth-condition of pattern prose. A quick test is: what makes this sentence true? If the sentence is true because the current text is arranged a certain way, because the author or reviewer must do something next, or because the current development state says so, then it is design-time residue, not pattern content.

Move that material to the authored-slice carrier, handoff, `DRR`, or companion architecture note. If a sentence is kept in the pattern, rewrite it so that its truth depends on the governed run-time/domain object or on the standard's declared normative claim set rather than on the current writing pass.
If a pattern or example claims **autonomy** for any Role, Method, or Service:
1) Add a subsection **“Autonomy (RoC‑E.16)”** that lists:
   * `AutonomyBudgetDeclRef` (id, version, Scope (G), Γ_time),
   * `Aut-Guard policy-id (PolicyIdRef)`,
   * `OverrideProtocolRef` (SpeechAct names, SoD),
   * pointer to where **Green‑Gate** applies in the Method steps,
   * where **AutonomyLedgerEntry** is recorded on `U.Work`.
2) Include one **Tell‑Show‑Show** vignette that demonstrates **depletion** and **override** handling.
3) Use **LEX‑BUNDLE** terms (Scope (G), Γ_time, Role, Method, and Work). Avoid “validity”, “process”, “actor”, “system”, “mechanism” unless mapped to admitted U-kinds or direct governing patterns.

### E.8:5 - Archetypal Grounding (System and Episteme)

| Template element | `U.System` illustration | `U.Episteme` illustration |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Section order | Pump‑assembly pattern follows sections **1–12** (and, optionally, **13**). | Meta‑analysis pattern follows the same sections. |
| S‑1 Density w/o Jargon | “The pump boundary is the sealing surface.” | “This episteme raises **F (Formality)** by making falsifiers testable.” |
| Hook‑Weave‑Ground | Opens with field anecdote → weaves in Γ‑core → ties the claim to motor torque. | Opens with historical paradox → weaves in **A.10** evidence refs → ties the claim to peer‑review data. |

*Note:* Prefer examples that reuse FPF characteristics vocabulary (e.g., **F (Formality)** rather than “F‑score”) unless you explicitly mean an external metric and name it as such.

### E.8:6 - Bias-Annotation
Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Universal** for the authoring conventions in this pattern.
This guidance biases toward **Did** (readability, narrative flow) and **Arch** (template regularity) by design; the mitigation is content-bearing reduced sections and justification through the smallest grounding, misuse, boundary, or reduced-case statement, not omission placeholders.

### E.8:7 - Conformance Checklist

**CC style (canonical).**
Conformance Checklist items are authoring checks: they test whether the pattern guidance has been applied and written correctly in a pattern or companion text that claims conformance. They do not replace `Solution`, do not make the pattern a control form, and do not state deontic obligations about the modeled world. A CC clause of the form “X SHALL ...” is to be read as “In a conforming pattern or companion text, X SHALL ...”.

**Preferred wording for new or edited CC items:** start with an explicit conformance subject (e.g., “Authors ...”, “Reviewers ...”, “A conforming implementation ...”, “A validator ...”). If a CC item is enforcing an admissibility predicate, it **SHOULD** cite the predicate’s identifier (from a `Definition:` / `Invariant:` / `Well-formedness constraint:` block) rather than restating the predicate as “X MUST ...”. For boundary/interface/protocol/declaration patterns, prefer A.6.B-scoped claim IDs (L/A/D/E) or cite an existing Claim Register (A.6.B:7) instead of restating mixed prose.

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| **CC-SG.0 (Heading discipline).** | Pattern and subsection headings **SHALL** follow **H-1 ... H-9** (FullId prefix, reserved punctuation, heading levels, ellipsis discipline). The Footer marker **SHALL** follow **H-9**. | Makes chunks self-contained; reduces ambiguity between author elision and retrieval truncation. |
| **CC-SG.1** | Every new pattern **SHALL** follow the section order defined in the Canonical Template (Title block -> ... -> Footer marker). | Guarantees structural comparability. |
| **CC-SG.1a (Initial pattern draft shape).** | The first non-empty authored version of a pattern **SHALL** already use the canonical section frame (Title block -> Footer marker). Authors **MUST NOT** start from one pre-template opening memo and promise to backfill canonical sections later. | Prevents large late-stage structural rewrites and keeps drafting aligned with `E.8` from the first substantive pass. |
| **CC-SG.2 (Grounding required).** | Every pattern **MUST** include an *Archetypal Grounding* section with at least one content-bearing Tell, Show, reduced grounding case, or ordinary/non-use boundary. A placeholder saying that grounding is absent is nonconforming. | Keeps patterns teachable and reduces "definition-only" ambiguity. |
| **CC-SG.3** | The *Bias-Annotation* section **SHALL** cite the five Principle-Taxonomy lenses and declare either “Universal” or an explicit scope limitation. | Keeps cross-disciplinary neutrality explicit (ties to Guard-Rail 4). |
| **CC-SG.4** | Deontic normative sentences **MUST** use only RFC-style keywords (see **H-8**); RFC keywords **MUST NOT** appear inside `Definition:`/`Invariant:`/`Well-formedness constraint:` blocks. When enforceable, admissibility/validity predicates **SHOULD** be referenced by id from the Conformance Checklist (rather than duplicated as “X MUST ...”). Informal deontic verbs are prohibited in normative clauses. | Prevents ambiguity between obligation language and model validity; improves auditability. |
| **CC-SG.5** | Pattern prose **SHOULD** demonstrate adherence to Style Principles **S-0 ... S-19**; reviewers are empowered to request revision when clarity or didactic quality suffers. | Embeds common narrative voice without rigid policing. |
| **CC-SG.6 (SoTA-Echo required).** | Every pattern **SHALL** include a **SoTA-Echoing** section and clearly state divergence of its Solution from SoTA with explanation of why. Architectural patterns **SHALL** satisfy the full authoring requirements below. Definitional patterns **SHALL** carry reduced SoTA when a full comparison is not meaningful: name which current practice is adopted, adapted, or rejected for terminology work, ambiguity or sense recovery, separation between constraint and ontology, controlled-vocabulary caution, or a comparable definitional problem. Internal coherence alone is not enough. | Ensures explicit lineage, guards against vocabulary drift, and prevents definitional patterns from using internal coherence as zero SoTA. |
| **CC-SG.7 (Post-2015, multi-Tradition).** | For Architectural patterns, SoTA-Echoing **SHALL** cite >= 3 post-2015 sources across >= 2 Traditions; each item **MUST** carry adoption status (adopt/adapt/reject) with reason. | Guards against monoculture; makes intent explicit. |
| **CC-SG.8 (Bridge & CL on reuse).** | Any cross-Context or ReferencePlane reuse mentioned in SoTA-Echoing **MUST** cite **Bridge id + CL** and (if ReferencePlanes differ) **Φ(CL)**/**Φ_plane** policy-ids; penalties **-> R_eff** only. | Safe, auditable reuse. |
| **CC-SG.9 (Lexical hygiene).** | The term **mapping** **SHALL NOT** appear in SoTA-Echoing except in the precise E.10 sense; use **alignment/Bridge/relation** instead. | Avoids overloading reserved vocabulary. |
| **CC-SG.10 (No keyword soup).** | SoTA-Echoing items **MUST** be written as sentences (not bare noun phrases); bullet lists are acceptable only with complete clauses. | Improves didactic quality and comparability. |
| **CC-SG.11 (Anti-patterns).** | Every pattern **SHALL** include a **Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them** section with at least one local misuse, overread, boundary case, or neighboring-pattern misuse relation. A placeholder saying no anti-pattern applies is nonconforming. | Makes misuse cases explicit and reduces review churn without creating omission-as-content. |
| **CC-SG.12 (Boundary claim-set discipline).** | If a pattern’s subject is a boundary, interface, API, protocol, connector, SLA, or other published boundary description, it **MUST** either (a) provide an **A.6.B**-governed atomic claim set (`L-*`/`A-*`/`D-*`/`E-*`, with stable IDs), or (b) explicitly cite an existing **A.6.B Claim Register** / scoped claim set that it reuses. | Pulls A.6.B into the authoring contour, prevents boundary-kind soup, and makes review more explicit and repeatable. |
| **CC-SG.13 (Didactic sufficiency).** | New patterns and substantial revisions **MUST** remain understandable without project-planning notes. When a pattern introduces a new named family, profile, or specialization, or adds a non-trivial note derived from another pattern, its Solution and Grounding **SHALL** carry enough didactic content: the relation to the pattern that governs the specific claim, ordinary-vs-FPF-governed wording guidance, at least one concrete source and resulting-publication slice where applicable, and visible related-pattern or project-side FPF kind and reference named by value cues. | Prevents skeleton-only patterns and project-context leakage. |
| **CC-SG.14 (Controlled prose, not free shorthand).** | FPF-governed prose **SHALL NOT** rely on bare relation words or planning shorthand whose governing-pattern relation is left implicit (e.g., bare “species”, “branch”, “flow”, or API-like “input/output” language). When a governing-pattern relation matters, authors **MUST** name it explicitly (`specialization under ...`, `profile governed by ...`, `overlay over ...`, etc.). | Keeps pattern prose precise and self-identifying. |
| **CC-SG.15 (Package-form and governing-pattern relation role-word discipline).** | When a pattern names a package-form or the governing-pattern relation of a family (`primary carrier`, `specialization`, `profile`, `overlay`, `family`, `bundle`, `cluster`, `suite`, `pack`, `kit`, `record`, `umbrella`), the chosen role word **MUST** match the intended ontology and **MUST NOT** be swapped for stylistic variety or left to implication. | Prevents semantic blur in pattern prose and keeps governing-pattern relations auditable. |
| **CC-SG.16 (Reader-role discipline).** | Authors **MUST** keep every pattern host or monolith section user-facing. FPF-development or package-architecture reasoning about isolation, overlay or carrier choice, freeze, merge state, planned evolution, review/executor correspondence, or quality/projection state **MUST NOT** occupy any pattern text, including notes, appendices, `Relations`, `Rationale`, `SoTA-Echoing`, worked slices, tables, or checklists; if such placement reasoning is still needed, put it in a separate companion, architecture, evaluation, review, projection, release, or landing carrier. A Part E pattern may govern FPF-pattern authoring, review, evaluation, entry, or publication as its subject matter, but it still may not carry rationale or instructions for developing that same pattern version unless the sentence is rewritten as the user-facing authoring, review, or evaluation move. | Keeps pattern prose aligned with its intended reader and prevents package-governance leakage into use guidance. |
| **CC-SG.16a (Referent-index discipline in pattern prose).** | Pattern sections **MUST** keep run-time/domain referents, normative-standard referents, and design-time/development-state referents distinct. In ordinary pattern prose, sentence truth **MUST** depend on the governed run-time/domain object or on the pattern's declared normative claim set, not on the current draft state, author action, reviewer action, or development-state status. If a sentence is true only because of the current writing/review pass or text arrangement, it is design-time residue and belongs in carriers or companion notes, not in the pattern. | Prevents Conway/process leakage, DesignRunTag drift, and late cleanup before review or landing. |
| **CC-SG.16b (Quality/projection carrier separation).** | Pattern text **MUST NOT** present `E.21` values, `PatternQualityStatus`, corpus-projection evidence, README/ToC/E.11/I.2 alignment, card/retrieval evidence, cold-reader evidence, monolith parity, landing evidence, developer/reviewer/executor correspondence, or other quality-carrier facts as pattern content. This applies to the whole host or monolith section, including notes, appendices, `Relations`, `Rationale`, `SoTA-Echoing`, examples, tables, and checklists. Such facts belong in evaluation results, review records, projection carriers, README, ToC, `E.11`, `I.2`, cards, retrieval/projection carriers, or release/landing evidence carriers. They may remain in the pattern only when the role test shows that the pattern's own `EntityOfConcern` and user-facing action are that evaluation/projection work, or when rewritten as the user-facing move or boundary that the evidence justifies. | Prevents pattern-quality and corpus-projection evidence from masquerading as practitioner guidance. |
| **CC-SG.17 (Recognition text and assurance text).** | Admission or substantial revision runs **MUST** check that a canonical pattern exposes a recognition text early enough for the intended working reader and an assurance text that carries declaration, guidance/check, modeling, and review/check scope without silently shifting the recognition-text claim. The recognition text **MUST** expose a recognisable working situation, what goes wrong if the pattern is missed, what the pattern buys, and a clear ordinary `not this pattern when` boundary. Any FPF-governed typed declaration or modeling lens **MUST** be exposed by a short user-facing statement of the primary `EntityOfConcern`, early FPF-governed technical terms **MUST** receive nearby pairwise plain glosses, and any `SoTA-Echoing` used as explanatory grounding **MUST** state a short practitioner or manager implication plus visible linkage to the worked cases or boundary slices it disciplines. If the pattern claims universal or transdisciplinary reach, the recognition text **MUST** demonstrate that claim through at least three heterogeneous reader or domain situations, preferably using an `F.16`-style example matrix or an equally explicit alternative. | Prevents text-clean but reader-opaque patterns and keeps broad claims visible where cold readers actually enter the text. |
| **CC-SG.17a (Problem-frame recognition signature and E.11 boundary).** | Authors **SHOULD** express a pattern's concrete working situation through the pattern's `Problem frame`, not through a separate navigation block. The `Problem frame` should make recoverable the primary `EntityOfConcern`, relation named by value, claim record, or stabilized concern, what goes wrong if the pattern is missed or misread, the ordinary not-this-pattern boundary, the first admissible action-guiding move, and the result that move buys. Only when an `E.11` pattern-entry discoverability problem is present should the same recognition text add candidate-pattern, tempting-wrong-pattern, entry-recognition reclassification, or first admissible entry-stop cues. Compact candidate-pattern comparison belongs in `E.11`-distributed entry material; expanded entry-disambiguation cases belong in `I.2`; lexical-query material belongs under the lexical/naming patterns and companion patterns that already govern it. Pattern-local `Start here when`, `First output`, neighboring-pattern lists, and `Common wrong escalations and boundary transfers` blocks **SHOULD NOT** replace the action-guiding `Problem frame` and `Solution`. | Keeps working-use recognition inside the canonical pattern frame while preventing navigation/workflow language from becoming local pattern structure. |
| **CC-SG.17b (Epistemic precision repair preserves action guidance).** | When authors edit pattern prose under `C.2.P`, the repaired recognition text **MUST** preserve or restore the first admissible action-guiding move as remaining admissible reader use, or explicitly name the neighboring FPF pattern that now carries that claim. When both Tech and Plain registers are active in the same sentence family, any Plain or didactic wording **MUST** map back to the recovered Tech reading under `E.10:6.2` when it carries ontological, evidence, causal, assurance, bridge, gate, work, decision, or admissibility claim kind or admissible-use boundary. More engaging recognition wording remains admissible as ordinary Plain prose only when it does not carry such claim kind or admissible-use boundary, or as a recognition aid whose claim kind or admissible-use boundary is recoverable through the recovered Tech reading or named FPF pattern application. Type-correct but inert wording is not mature pattern prose. | Prevents epistemic precision cleanup from leaving pattern guidance inert while also preventing expressive prose from reintroducing overread. |
| **CC-SG.18 (Precision before relaxation).** | In FPF-governed prose, authors **MUST NOT** leave a generic head noun or qualifier with FPF-governed use uninterpreted when that phrase carries semantic, boundary, or authority claim kind or admissible-use boundary. A narrowing qualifier by itself does **not** restore the head kind. Authors **MUST** restore head kind first, then qualifier claim kind or admissible-use boundary, then any comparison criterion or escalation condition before downstream claim or effect. If a later Plain, didactic, or coarsened rendering is kept, the more precise upstream reading **MUST** remain recoverable. | Prevents ambiguity from being hidden inside ordinary-looking phrases and keeps softened prose subordinate to an explicit authoritative reading. |
| **CC-SG.18a (Semio-Echoing auxiliary placement).** | `Semio-Echoing` or comparable semio-facing material **MUST** be trigger-controlled and auxiliary. A conforming non-semio pattern keeps its own `EntityOfConcern`, first useful move, practical payoff, stop condition, and related-pattern relations primary; it adds semio material only when the EntityOfConcern, episteme/publication stack, alignment basis, and remaining admissible reader use are recoverable by value under `E.10`, `C.2.P`, or `E.10.ARCH`. Generic description/publication-use guards about descriptions, views, publications, records, cards, diagrams, sources, or files not being permissions, promises, prescriptions, evidence items, assurance verdicts, decisions, gate passages, releases, work occurrences, or authority sources belong in a named boundary section or exact description-publication pattern, not as the main subject Solution. When a semio-bias repair touches several non-semio patterns or source rows, conformance evidence is row-atomic: for each affected pattern or source row, name the primary `EntityOfConcern`, first useful move, required pattern-quality checks, guard placement, first-screen result, related-pattern relations named by value, and any source re-seeding result. | Prevents semio-bias: correct language checks must not replace the pattern's constructive method guidance. |
| **CC-SG.18b (Positive subject content and precision-restoration profile control).** | A conforming pattern's first substantive content in `Problem frame` and `Solution` **MUST** be the positive subject-kind/action spine: primary `EntityOfConcern`, first useful move, practical delta, and bounded non-use needed for that move. Material from any precision-restoration layer **MUST NOT** compete with that spine. Boundary doctrine and related-pattern mapping are pattern content like any other doctrine: if the governing pattern, strict distinction, non-use rule, README/ToC/E.11/I.2 entry cue, or relation row already carries it, use one short pointer instead of repeating it locally; add local boundary prose only for a documented local confusion and exact stop condition. Pattern application **MUST** stay explicit: patterns are applied to situations, claims, texts, or work objects, and related FPF patterns are stated as declarative pattern relations in `Relations` only after this pattern has stated its own ontology, method, norm, worked action, or other positive solution content. For phrase-level apparatus, apply `F.19`; for remaining word/head/use precision, apply `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `F.18`, or the governing pattern. Architecture-placement or package-boundary rationale stays in `DRR`, architecture documents, review handoff, or companion material; if it implies a working-reader use, write that use in pattern terms and keep the rationale outside the pattern. | Prevents precision-restoration debt and architecture/reference boilerplate from replacing the pattern's own subject matter. |
| **CC-SG.18c (Kind-preserving wording repair).** | A changed FPF-governed phrase **MUST** leave the pre-repair and post-repair primary `EntityOfConcern`, kind, relation or claim kind, current ontic slot, relation position, use relation, or claim kind, admissible use, and scope recoverable when those items are live. Removing a trigger word, changing a head, or replacing a phrase is not a repair until the author can show that the kind and any live current ontic slot, relation position, use relation, or claim kind were preserved, split by accepted decision, or intentionally changed by accepted decision, and can cite the governing pattern when another pattern governs the kind under repair, relation, claim, or position. | Prevents lexical cleanup from becoming ontology drift. |

### E.8:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

These failure modes recur in drafts and in downstream application. They are predictable ways the Forces in this pattern get violated.

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Why it fails | How to avoid / repair |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Template cargo-culting** | Headings exist, but each section is a thin bullet list with no narrative. | Satisfies Uniformity but loses Readability and Didactic Primacy. | Use S-0 narrative flow per section; write 2-4 sentence micro-paragraphs before any list/table. |
| **Un-grounded abstractions** | Problem/Solution stay abstract; no concrete System/Episteme Tell-Show-Show. | Breaks teachability and makes misuse likely. | Fill Archetypal Grounding first; then back-propagate concrete nouns into Problem/Forces/Solution. |
| **SoTA name-dropping** | SoTA-Echoing is a list of nouns/buzzwords with no adopt/adapt/reject rationale. | Violates CC-SG.7 and CC-SG.10; readers cannot audit alignment. | For each source, state what is adopted/adapted/rejected and why (complete clauses, 2-4 sentences). |
| **Tool-bound normativity** | A vendor tool, file format, or schema is described as required to apply the pattern. Data governance implied. | Violates Guard-Rails (lexical firewall; notation independence, data governance absence); reduces portability and conceptual clarity. | Keep normative content conceptual; move tooling and data governance into Context-local Profiles. |
| **Hidden trade-offs** | Solution sounds universally good; Consequences lists only benefits. | Removes decision-use value; applicability cannot be judged. | In Consequences, include at least one trade-off and a mitigation; if none exists, explain why. |
| **Skeleton-only pattern** | The template is present, but the pattern gives only one compressed definition block and scenario labels. | Passes form while failing didactic sufficiency. | Add didactic content: local decomposition, concrete slices, reviewer cues, and neighboring-pattern or project-side FPF kind and reference named by value guidance. |
| **Project-context leakage** | A reader needs architecture memos or planning notes to understand the pattern. | The monolith stops being self-sufficient. | Move the essential problem framing, worked slices, and rationale into the pattern itself; keep project reviews informative only. |
| **Repeated content, reference, and architecture boilerplate leakage** | Problem frame or Solution spends user-facing space repeating the same guard, distinction, mini-rule, reference, definition, caveat, related-pattern mapping, placement note, split rationale, or defer rationale without a new local action/case/evidence need. | The product text becomes an architecture memo or reference note instead of a pattern. Ordinary references, footnotes, README/ToC/E.11/I.2 entry cues, and `Relations` already carry cross-reference work; repeating it as prose hides the positive Solution. | Replace the boilerplate with a normal pattern id, citation, `Builds on`, `Coordinates with`, `Relations`, README/ToC/E.11/I.2 entry cue, or architecture/DRR note. Keep only a local boundary sentence when it changes the first admissible move. |
| **Quality-carrier leakage** | Any host or monolith pattern text, including notes, appendices, `Relations`, `Rationale`, `SoTA-Echoing`, examples, tables, or checklist rows, talks about corpus projection, README/ToC/E.11/I.2 alignment, retrieval/cold-reader evidence, monolith parity, landing evidence, `PatternQualityStatus`, all-`4`/all-`5` posture, or developer/reviewer/executor correspondence as if that is pattern content. | The text is now about why the pattern can be evaluated, found, landed, or trusted, or about role-turn communication, rather than about what the intended user should do. | Move the quality/projection facts to `E.21`, `E.19`, README/ToC/E.11/I.2, projection/card/retrieval, or release/landing carriers. Keep only the user-facing action or boundary justified by that evidence. |
| **Apparatus overwrap** | A simple pattern claim, relation, object, action, or placement is wrapped in extra role, carrier, locus, flow, state, status, text-state, package, or process words. | The sentence may be technically correct, but the reader sees apparatus before the pattern's object and move. A poetic plain rewrite can be just as bad if it loses the FPF kind. | Apply `F.19`; the final rewrite keeps the same `EntityOfConcern`, head kind, relation or claim kind, established FPF term, concerned role, and flow role. |
| **Generic-head underspecification** | An FPF-governed phrase uses a generic head such as `note`, `view`, `guidance`, `output`, or `artifact`, but the text never restores what kind of thing that phrase names. | The reader cannot tell what ontology the sentence is actually governing. | Restore the head kind first in pattern-local or project-local terms before any broader claim or effect or comparison is made. |
| **Qualifier-smuggled claim kind or admissible-use boundary** | A modifier such as `comparative`, `safe`, `interactive`, `reliable`, or `faithful` is doing the semantic work while the text leaves its claim kind or admissible-use boundary implicit. | The sentence sounds precise without actually stating its comparison criterion, relation claim kind or admissible-use boundary, or downstream claim or effect boundary. | Unpack the qualifier into explicit claim kind or admissible-use boundary, criteria, named neighboring FPF pattern, or project-side FPF kind and reference rather than relying on the modifier alone. |
| **Mixed comparison criterion** | One sentence compares or ranks publication-form, carrier, process, authority-reference, or project-record values under one declared criterion. | The sentence becomes ontologically incoherent when the compared objects do not share the criterion, even if each local noun sounds plausible. | First restore head kind, then qualifier claim kind or admissible-use boundary, then rewrite the comparison through a homogeneous claim-kind criterion, threshold, or named governing-pattern relation condition. |
| **Implicit relation shorthand** | Words like “species”, “branch”, or process metaphors do the semantic work without naming the actual governing-pattern relation. | Readers infer the wrong ontology or workflow. | State the governing-pattern relation explicitly and remove shorthand that only makes sense inside project discussions. |
| **Package-form and governing-pattern relation drift** | Words like `bundle`, `cluster`, `profile`, `overlay`, `family`, `suite`, or `kit` are swapped as if they were stylistic variants. | Readers cannot tell whether the text is naming an `authoritySourceRef` target, a navigation grouping, a review role, or a packaged set of defaults. | Pick one role word by ontology, keep the governing-pattern relation explicit, and do not vary the noun unless the ontology really changes. |
| **Reader-role leakage** | Pattern sections start telling the reader why the pattern was isolated, what landing form is safest, or why freeze/merge is premature. | The pattern stops teaching the user and starts narrating FPF-development decisions. | Move package-development reasoning to companion notes; keep pattern sections about admissible use, costs, boundaries, and neighboring FPF pattern governing that claims or project-side FPF kinds and references for the intended user. |
| **Editorial/development self-instruction leak** | The pattern starts saying things like `this draft should ...`, `later authoring will ...`, or `that is the opening this draft must hold`. | The text stops addressing the working reader and starts narrating the current editorial or drafting process. | Move the sentence to the authored-slice carrier or handoff, or rewrite it as one user-facing claim about the primary `EntityOfConcern`, boundary, or practical consequence. |
| **Role-clean but pragmatically foggy** | The pattern addresses the right reader in principle, but a cold practitioner still cannot recognise the working situation, practical payoff, primary `EntityOfConcern`, first useful move, or project-level implication of the `SoTA-Echoing` early enough. | The text passes role hygiene but still fails `E.12`/`E.13`/`E.14` as working guidance. | Bring a manager-first or practitioner-first recognition cue higher, add one minimally viable worked case, state what changes in practice, expose the primary `EntityOfConcern` and any minimal modeling lens in plain user-facing prose, add plain glosses for early FPF-governed technical terms, and keep `SoTA-Echoing` tied to visible practitioner or manager implications plus nearby case linkage rather than lineage alone. |
| **Hybrid audience blob** | One main narrative tries to serve engineers, managers, auditors, architects, and researchers at once with no primary working reader or concern role. | The text becomes globally polite but locally blurry; no reader knows which concern governs the first role. | Make the primary working reader, concern, and viewpoint explicit and assign other audiences to secondary companion roles, other faces, or an explicit out-of-scope note. |

### E.8:9 - Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Predictable skeleton** – readers instantly know where to find context, forces, and criteria. | Limits author freedom in macro layout; mitigated by flexibility inside the Solution subsection. |
| **Cohesive voice** – S‑principles give FPF a recognisable style, aiding memorability. | Reviewers must read for style, not only semantics; checklists reduce review effort. |
| **Embedded pedagogy** – Tell‑Show‑Show and Hook → Close heuristics turn the spec into a self‑teaching text. | Slightly longer patterns; justified by better comprehension and fewer clarifying DRRs. |

### E.8:10 - Rationale
Structure and style function as FPF’s *grammar*. By unifying what were
once separate “template” and “style guide” patterns, authors face a
single reference point that satisfies:

* **P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** – uniform, minimal surprises.
* **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** – narrative flow, dual archetype examples.
* Guard‑Rails 1 & 2 – no tool jargon, no notation lock‑in inside prose.

A unified template also improves retrieval: a chunk containing `A.2:<n> - Bias‑Annotation` remains self‑identifying even when parent headings are missing, and the recommended footer marker makes truncation detectable.

International and industry standards often speak in terms of *conformance criteria*. FPF uses the label **Conformance Checklist** to make adoption easier for engineers and managers.

### E.8:11 - SoTA-Echoing  *(normative; lineage and deltas to contemporary State-of-the-Art)*

**Purpose.** Make each pattern's relationship to contemporary best-known problem-solving practice explicit and comparable without importing tooling or data governance. This section is prose-first and notation-independent. It does not mint an independent second rule source, but it is an FPF-governed alignment section: the Solution, Conformance Checklist, Relations, worked cases, and other FPF-governed sections must reflect the stance stated here or explicitly justify divergence.

**SoTA definition.** In FPF, `SoTA` names the best-known currently defensible problem-solving practice for the named practice question in the relevant domain or practice tradition. It is not official status, a recent edition, broad popularity, citation volume, institutional adoption, reputation, or familiar terminology. A standard, book, paper, benchmark, or practice report carries SoTA only when it states or justifies the current best-known answer for the named practice question; otherwise it is lineage, current-standard reference, rationale-only material, or rejected-popular-practice material.

**Two-part SoTA test.** A row must pass both tests. First, the source family must be SoTA-bearing: it must represent the current best-known answer for the named practice question or a clearly named current branch of that answer. Second, the pattern must incorporate that answer by value: the adopted, adapted, or rejected stance must change `Solution`, boundary, anti-pattern, rationale, checklist, relation, worked case, evidence requirement, stop/reopen condition, or another FPF-governed pattern locus. A current best-known source that changes no FPF locus is uncaptured SoTA; a citation that changes wording without being current best-known practice is not SoTA.

**Incorporation test.** A SoTA row is accepted as pattern grounding only when it changes what the pattern lets a working user do, what the pattern forbids them to over-read, which neighbouring FPF pattern must apply, which evidence or validation requirement remains applicable, or how the Solution and neighbouring FPF-governed sections are written. A citation that only decorates the pattern or proves that the author has read a tradition does not carry E.8.

**Minimum contents (authoring requirements).**
1) **Evidence binding (no duplicate SoTA).** If a **SoTA Synthesis Pack** exists (G.2), this section **SHALL cite** its **ClaimSheet IDs, CorpusLedger entries, and BridgeMatrix rows** as the governing evidence source for claims and report `adopt`, `adapt`, or `reject` **consistent with those IDs**. Avoid forking an untracked SoTA narrative.
1a) **Accepted decision and source material set, not DRR-only narrowing.** When a pattern is drafted under an accepted `DRR` and other accepted decision or source materials also exist by value, the `DRR` remains the decision and placement record, but `SoTA-Echoing`, neighboring-pattern relations, and any minimal modeling or mathematical lens **MAY** and **SHOULD** inherit non-conflicting material from that accepted material set.
2) **Sources (current problem-solving source refs, not prestige refs).** For **Architectural patterns**, cite at least 3 primary SoTA source refs that carry current best-known answers for the named practice question, with at least **two independent Traditions** when more than one serious tradition currently answers that question. For **Definitional patterns**, cite at least 1 current source or practice ref for the reduced issue being governed: terminology work, ambiguity or sense recovery, separation between constraint and ontology, controlled-vocabulary caution, or a comparable definitional problem. If the best source is older but still current, mark why it still answers the named practice question rather than treating source age, standard status, or popularity as SoTA by itself.
3) **Best-known, not merely popular.** Authors **SHALL** distinguish best-known currently defensible practice from merely widespread or fashionable defaults. If the pattern adopts, adapts, or rejects a popular but less defensible practice, that divergence **MUST** be stated explicitly.
3a) **Currentness and lineage status.** Older standards, early papers, and historically important examples may be cited as lineage only when later practice has materially changed the answer. They may carry a SoTA row only when the pattern states why the source ref is still current for the named practice question or pairs it with a current source that supplies the current practice.
3b) **Problem-domain and practice answerability.** The selected SoTA source family **MUST** answer the governed working problem and the relevant domain or practice tradition. It **MUST NOT** be selected only because it makes package placement, naming neatness, or pattern clustering easier to justify.
4) **Practice alignment.** For each cited item, state **what is adopted, adapted, or rejected** and **why** in 2 to 4 sentences.
5) **Scale admissibility.** If numeric operations are implied, bind to ComparatorSet or CG-Spec and declare partial-order stance with no hidden scalarization.
6) **Cross-Context reuse.** Any reuse across `U.BoundedContext` must expose Bridge id plus CL and, if ReferencePlanes differ, Phi policy ids; penalties affect only `R_eff`.
7) **Lexical hygiene.** Avoid “mapping” unless you mean an explicit Bridge, translation relation, or other named relation with loss notes.

**Writing guidance (readability).**
*Write short paragraphs, not tag lists.* For each Tradition, provide one sentence naming the practice, one sentence comparing it to the pattern's Solution, and one sentence giving adoption status with reason. Where helpful, add one **System** and one **Episteme** micro-example (Tell-Show-Show).

**Format: human-first.** A small table is allowed, but each row **MUST** be accompanied by 1 to 2 sentences as above. Vendor tokens, tool tokens, file formats, or data schemas are out of scope unless the named practice question under discussion makes them have FPF-governed use.

#### E.8:11.1 - SoTA alignment for this pattern (E.8 self-echo)

| Claim (E.8 need) | SoTA practice (post-2015) | Use of source | Primary source (post-2015) | Alignment with E.8 | Adoption status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pattern texts must be teachable, not just correct. | Use a stable skeleton with context, problem, forces, solution, actions, and consequences, plus illustration and checks, to keep patterns readable and actionable. | **Current-practice writing-guidance use.** This row is used for E.8's canonical pattern skeleton and didactic ordering; it is not treated as external authority over FPF ontology. | Iba (2021), “How to Write Patterns: A Practical Guide for Creating a Pattern Language on Human Actions” (PLoP 2021 PLoPourri). | Canonical Template mirrors the skeleton and adds Archetypal Grounding plus Conformance Checklist as first-class sections. | **Adopt and adapt.** Adopt the skeleton; adapt by making bias and conformance explicit sections. |
| Pattern quality needs explicit validation beyond folklore. | Critique of ad hoc validation, including the rule of three, and push toward more rigorous discovery and validation methods. | **Current-best source use for pattern discovery and validation rigor in this row's narrow use.** The source changes E.8 by requiring validation to be explicit rather than folklore-based. | Riehle, Harutyunyan, Barcomb (2020), “Pattern Discovery and Validation Using Scientific Research Methods”. | E.8 encodes validation as Conformance Checklist plus SoTA-Echoing with adoption status and evidence binding. | **Adopt.** Adopt auditability goals; keep the mechanism lightweight through checks and evidence binding. |
| Governance should constrain structure, not mandate tools. | Specify conformance and structure; do not prescribe processes, notations, tools, or recording media. | **Current-standard reference use.** The architecture-description standard supplies a useful conformance-vs-tooling distinction, but E.8 does not import architecture-description ontology as pattern-authoring ontology. | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022, *Software, systems and enterprise - Architecture description*. | E.8 is template-centric and conformance-centric, with guardrails against tool and notation lock-in in core narrative. | **Adopt.** Directly adopt the conformance-not-tooling discipline for authoring shape. |
| Pattern languages are networks; visuals often mislead. | Systematic surveys report low consensus on what to visualise and ambiguous or inexpressive visuals; relations need clear definition in text. | **Current-practice rationale use.** The source is used as rationale for the text-first relation discipline; it is not current-best source material for all pattern-language visualization. | Quirino, Barcellos, Falbo (2018), “Visual Notations for Software Pattern Languages: A Mapping Study”. | E.8 requires a Relations section and keeps diagrams optional, placing primacy on textual structure and explicit links. | **Adapt.** Use the finding as rationale for text-first, relation-explicit authoring. |
| Controlled technical writing should be plain without losing necessary terms. | Plain-language practice writes for a specific audience, removes unnecessary words and hidden verbs, avoids synonym churn for the same object, and keeps necessary technical or legal terms when they carry the meaning. | **Current-practice source use for kind-safe plain wording.** The source changes E.8 by making plain wording a precision-preserving diagnostic, not decorative simplification. | U.S. Plain Writing Act implementation and Digital.gov plain-language guides; SEC, *A Plain English Handbook*. | E.8 encodes kind-safe plain rewriting: remove phrase-level role/carrier/locus/flow/status apparatus only when it adds no kind, relation, evidence value, or user-facing action; preserve established FPF terms unless `E.10`/`F.18` changes them. | **Adapt.** Adopt audience-first, concise, consistent wording; adapt it to FPF kind preservation. |

### E.8:12 - Relations
* **Coordinates with:** `E.9.DA` when an authored pattern body is drafted from a concrete `DRR` and the blocker is whether the `DRR` selected, distributed, carried source use, carried accepted decisions, or supplied a first drafting action sufficiently for that authoring use. `E.8` still governs the pattern body; `E.9.DA` is not a mandatory authoring section, review card, or substitute for writing the Solution.

* **Builds on:** E.6, E.7
* **Constrained by:** Guard‑Rails E.5.1–E.5.4 (lexical firewall, notation independence, etc.)
* **Coordinates with:** `E.21` when one authored FPF pattern version is evaluated as a scoped pattern-quality claim. `E.8` governs authoring shape, recognition text, action guidance, worked cases, SoTA grounding, and conformance material; `E.21` governs the pattern-quality evaluation, required coordinate values, `PatternQualityStatus`, and stop condition. Do not import `E.21` as a mandatory authoring section or full review card.
* **Coordinates with:** `E.23` when an authored FPF pattern body is being improved through repeated passes. `E.8` still governs the authored pattern body; `E.23` governs the repeated quality-improvement method; the object-under-improvement evaluation such as `E.21` or `E.9.DA` supplies value meanings and stop meanings.
* **Coordinates with:** `E.13` when an authored pattern claims practical payoff or uses a visible quality value, metric, checklist result, review result, or release posture as if it were the intended value. `E.8` keeps the payoff in user-facing prose; `E.13` repairs proxy-to-value substitution.
* **Coordinates with:** `E.11.PUR` when the authoring question is which FPF pattern use is recommended for a current concern, and with `E.10.MOVE` when move-like wording in pattern prose hides whether the current value is pattern-use recommendation, direct work, plan, gate, transformation, publication, source, architecture, call-planning, or language-state material.


* **Constrains:** All patterns; the DRR template references the same section order.

### E.8:End
