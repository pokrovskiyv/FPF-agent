## E.24.PUB - Ontic Description and Publication Discipline

> **Type:** Part E FPF authoring discipline pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless a section is explicitly informative

### E.24.PUB:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when a text, table, card, record, schema, diagram, view, source row, or pattern section may be confused with the ontic it describes.

Typical moments:

- a pattern file is treated as if it were the ontic rather than a publication of an ontic-description episteme;
- a card, record, table, schema, diagram, or view is cited as if its form created the governed object;
- an ontic description starts to grow generic warnings about proof, promise, authority, permission, gate, source, evidence, decision, or work instead of staying centered on the ontic;
- a subject pattern about architecture, structure, characteristic space, transformation, episteme, or bounded context begins with publication-use guards while the subject matter becomes background;
- a source packet or review packet is used as if it carried ontology authority by appearance.

**First useful move.** Name four objects separately: the ontic under concern, the ontic-description episteme, the publication of that description, and the publication form used by that publication.

**What goes wrong if missed.** The pattern becomes about how to talk about a thing rather than about the thing. A diagram becomes an architecture claim or selected structure, a score table becomes characteristic space, a problem card becomes problem ontology, and a pattern host becomes the ontic it publishes.

**What this buys.** The author can put publication-form and description-use issues in the right place without pushing the primary subject pattern into semio-bias.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If the current question is whether a construct deserves a durable ontic, use `E.24.CD` and then `E.24`.
- If the current question is generic multi-view publication or viewpoint packaging, use `E.17` and its dependent patterns.
- If the current question is wording-use repair, use `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `F.19`, or the relevant precision-restoration pattern.
- If the current question is an architecture description as its own subject matter, use `C.30.AD`; E.24.PUB supplies only the boundary between the ontic and its publication-facing description stack.

### E.24.PUB:1 - Problem Frame

Ontics need descriptions. In FPF, the usual description is an episteme: a structured claim set about the ontic, its identity, slot relation, admissible fillers, dependent patterns, and use boundary. That episteme can be published through a pattern host, a card, a table, a schema, a diagram, a source packet, or another publication form.

Those objects have different kinds:

- the `U.Ontic` is the subject under concern;
- the ontic-description episteme is the claim structure describing that subject;
- the publication is the made-available expression of that episteme;
- the publication form is the format, layout, or medium shape used by that publication.

E.24.PUB governs this distinction for ontic descriptions. It does not replace `C.2.1` for epistemes, `E.17` for multi-view publication, `E.8` for pattern form, or `E.10` for wording-use repair.

### E.24.PUB:2 - Problem

Without this discipline:

1. **Publication form displaces the subject.** Users start reasoning about a card or diagram when the real EoC is an ontic such as `U.Episteme`, `U.Structure`, `U.CharacteristicSpace`, or `U.BoundedContext`.
2. **Subject patterns become semio-heavy.** A pattern about a subject begins with long warnings about what descriptions are not, while identity, slots, invariants, and first-use moves come late.
3. **Descriptions become authority by appearance.** A source row, standard, table, or pattern section is treated as governing because it looks formal.
4. **Publication variants become duplicate ontology.** Several views or forms of one ontic description are treated as several different ontics.
5. **Generic semio guards repeat everywhere.** Each subject pattern copies the same "not proof, not decision, not permission" catalogue instead of using the governing semio patterns.

### E.24.PUB:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Ontic focus vs publication practicality | Users need forms they can read and use, but the form must not become the subject. |
| Description adequacy vs semio overgrowth | Ontic descriptions need boundary statements; copied generic semio doctrine can bury the subject. |
| Multiple publications vs one subject | One ontic may have several publications, views, or forms; those variants must not create several ontics. |
| Formal appearance vs governing authority | A schema, standard, or source row may look authoritative, but authority comes from the governing pattern or accepted source relation, not appearance. |
| Local clarity vs generic duplication | A short local boundary helps; a repeated negative catalogue belongs in neighboring semio patterns. |

### E.24.PUB:4 - Solution

Use the ontic-description stack before writing or revising publication-facing text:

```text
OnticDescriptionStack:
  OnticEoC:
  OnticDescriptionEpisteme:
  DescriptionClaims:
  Publication:
  PublicationForm:
  GovernedUse:
  NonOverread:
  NeighboringPatternIfCurrent:
```

Read the stack this way:

- `OnticEoC` is the ontic itself: for example `U.Ontic`, `U.Episteme`, `U.Structure`, `U.CharacteristicSpace`, `U.BoundedContext`, or another accepted ontic.
- `OnticDescriptionEpisteme` is the claim structure that describes the ontic and its slot relation.
- `DescriptionClaims` are the specific claims about identity, slots, admissible values, dependent patterns, invariants, examples, and use boundary.
- `Publication` is the made-available expression of that episteme.
- `PublicationForm` is the selected form: pattern host, card, record, table, schema, diagram, view, source packet, or another form.
- `GovernedUse` says what a user may do with the publication in the current pattern.
- `NonOverread` blocks the main confusion without listing every generic semio boundary.
- `NeighboringPatternIfCurrent` names the governing neighboring pattern when the current claim belongs elsewhere.

#### E.24.PUB:4.1 - Minimal Boundary Formula

When a subject pattern needs a publication boundary, use the shortest formula that preserves the EoC:

```text
This [publication form] publishes an ontic-description episteme about [OnticEoC].
It is not [OnticEoC].
Use it for [governed use].
Use [neighboring pattern] when the current claim is about [neighboring EoC].
```

Do not expand that local formula into a general catalogue of all things a description is not. If proof, permission, gate, source, evidence, authority-bearing record, decision, or work is current, name the governing neighboring pattern and apply it for that neighboring EoC or claim.

#### E.24.PUB:4.2 - Description Claims Stay About the Ontic

An ontic-description episteme may claim:

- what identifies the ontic;
- which slot relation gives the ontic its structure;
- which values may fill the slots and which governing pattern owns each value;
- which invariants and non-use boundaries preserve the ontic;
- which dependent patterns may rely on the ontic;
- which examples show first use without turning the example form into the ontic.

It should not carry generic warnings about all possible uses of descriptions. Those warnings belong to `C.2.1`, `E.17`, `E.10`, `F.19`, source patterns, evidence patterns, gate patterns, decision patterns, or another subject pattern when that subject is current.

#### E.24.PUB:4.3 - Publication Forms Stay Downstream

A publication form may improve usability, inspection, currentness, source return, or multi-view handling. It does not decide ontology by itself.

Use this test:

1. If changing the table layout, card fields, diagram notation, or section order changes only how the ontic is published, the ontic is unchanged.
2. If changing a description claim changes what the ontic is asserted to be, inspect the ontic-description episteme through `C.2.1`.
3. If changing a slot relation or identity criterion changes the ontic itself, apply the governing ontic pattern or `E.24`.
4. If changing viewpoint or publication packaging changes which reader concern is served, use `E.17` or the relevant view or publication pattern.

#### E.24.PUB:4.4 - Subject Pattern Placement

In a subject pattern, keep the positive subject spine first:

1. name the EoC and practical situation;
2. state identity, slot relation, invariants, first-use move, and governed use;
3. add one compact publication boundary only where needed;
4. send description-use or publication-use claims to neighboring semio patterns.

This prevents semio-bias. A pattern about architecture should teach architecture first. A pattern about structure should teach structure first. A pattern about characteristic space should teach characteristic space first. Publication and description boundaries protect those patterns; they do not become their main subject unless the pattern EoC is itself a description or publication.

If the EoC is a description, repeat the same test one level up. A pattern about an architecture description should center that description as the EoC; claims about descriptions of that description, publication of that description, and use of that publication stay in a bounded publication section or neighboring patterns.

### E.24.PUB:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### E.24.PUB:5.1 - E.24 Pattern Host and U.Ontic

`E.24` is a publication of an ontic-description episteme about `U.Ontic`. The host text is not `U.Ontic`. Its tables, examples, headings, and source rows help publish the description; they do not create the ontic by appearance.

If the issue is whether `U.Ontic` has stable identity and a slot relation, use `E.24`. If the issue is whether the E.24 host is formatted, sectioned, or published well, use `E.8`, `E.17`, or this pattern as appropriate.

#### E.24.PUB:5.2 - Characteristic Space and Score Table

A score table may publish a filled evaluation over a `U.CharacteristicSpace`. The table is not the characteristic space. The characteristic space is the ontic with characterized object, characteristics, scales, value meanings, coordinate groups, missingness semantics, normalization boundaries, and comparability boundaries.

If the score table is unclear, fix the publication. If the scale meanings are unclear, fix the characteristic-space description through `A.19` or the relevant evaluation pattern. If the question is how to construct the space, use `A.19.ECS`.

#### E.24.PUB:5.3 - Architecture Description and ArchitectureOf@Context

An architecture description is an episteme about one `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim or about selected `U.Structure` refs for a described `U.Holon` in a `U.BoundedContext`. A diagram, view, document, or pattern section may publish that episteme. The publication form is not the `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim, not the selected `U.Structure`, and not the described holon's structure by itself.

`C.30` stays centered on the `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim and the selected structures that matter for the current architectural question. `A.22` stays centered on `U.Structure`. `C.30.AD` centers architecture description as its own EoC. E.24.PUB supplies the bridge: know which object is being described before deciding whether the publication, view, or source row is current.

#### E.24.PUB:5.4 - Problem Card

A problem card can publish a problematization episteme or a project work record. The card is not automatically `U.Problem`, and the presence of fields does not decide the ontology. If the current question is problem formulation, use the problematization pattern. If it is the card form, use the publication-form pattern. If a reusable problem ontic is proposed, apply `E.24.CD` for candidate detection and `E.24` for the ontic-introduction decision.

### E.24.PUB:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Onto**, **Epist**, **Semio**, **Arch**, **Prag**, **Did**.

This pattern intentionally resists semio-bias inside subject patterns. It does not deny that descriptions and publications matter. It says they must stay in the right slot:

- the ontic remains the subject when the pattern is about the ontic;
- the description episteme becomes the subject only when the pattern is about that description;
- the publication becomes the subject only when publication, currentness, source return, multi-view handling, or reader-facing use is current;
- the publication form never receives ontology authority by appearance.

### E.24.PUB:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-E24PUB-1` | The text names the ontic EoC separately from the ontic-description episteme, publication, and publication form. |
| `CC-E24PUB-2` | The publication form is not treated as evidence that a durable ontic exists. |
| `CC-E24PUB-3` | Description claims stay centered on identity, slot relation, admissible fillers, invariants, dependent patterns, and use boundary for the ontic. |
| `CC-E24PUB-4` | Generic semio guards are not copied into subject patterns; neighboring patterns are named when those claims are current. |
| `CC-E24PUB-5` | Multiple views, diagrams, tables, cards, schemas, or sections do not create duplicate ontics unless an E.24 decision selects a distinct ontic. |
| `CC-E24PUB-6` | Subject patterns keep the positive EoC spine before publication-boundary text. |
| `CC-E24PUB-7` | Patterns whose EoC is a description still keep publication of that description and descriptions of that description distinct. |
| `CC-E24PUB-8` | The local non-overread sentence blocks the current confusion without becoming a long negative catalogue. |

### E.24.PUB:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pattern host as ontic | The file or section is cited as if it were the object it describes. | Name the ontic EoC and the ontic-description episteme separately. |
| Diagram as architecture claim | A diagram is treated as the `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim or as the selected `U.Structure` itself. | Treat the diagram as a publication form of an architecture-description episteme; use `C.30` for the `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim or `A.22` for selected `U.Structure`. |
| Score table as characteristic space | A table of scores is treated as the characteristic-space ontology. | Separate the table, filled evaluation, and `U.CharacteristicSpace`. |
| Generic guard pile-up | A subject pattern opens with a long list of what a description is not. | Keep one non-overread sentence and send neighboring claims to their patterns. |
| View variant as duplicate ontology | Several views of one subject are treated as several subjects. | Use `E.17` for view or publication packaging and keep the ontic identity stable. |

### E.24.PUB:9 - Consequences

Positive consequences:

- Subject patterns can stay centered on their EoC while still guarding against publication-form overread.
- Ontic descriptions become clearer because their claims are about identity, slot relation, values, invariants, and use boundaries.
- Publication variants can multiply without multiplying ontology.
- `E.24` stays compact because publication discipline sits beside it, not inside it.

Costs:

- Authors must name the stack explicitly when publication and ontology are easy to confuse.
- Some familiar phrases such as "the diagram shows the architecture" need a more careful interpretation: the diagram publishes an architecture description, and the description concerns an `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim or selected `U.Structure` refs for the described holon in context.
- Generic semio warnings must be moved out of subject spines.

### E.24.PUB:10 - Rationale

FPF needs E.24.PUB because ontics are normally encountered through descriptions and publications. Without a separate publication discipline, the same subject pattern is pulled in two directions: it must teach the subject, but it also tries to guard every possible misuse of descriptions. The result is semio-bias.

The remedy is not to ignore descriptions. The remedy is to type the stack. Once the ontic, description episteme, publication, and publication form are separated, subject patterns can carry a short local boundary and then continue the subject treatment. Publication-heavy questions use publication patterns. Wording-use questions use wording-use patterns. Multi-view questions use multi-view patterns.

### E.24.PUB:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Source family | Current lesson for E.24.PUB | FPF decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shimizu and Hitzler 2024, Eells, Dave, Hitzler, and Shimizu 2024, plus modular ODP practice. | Current modular-ontology support: reusable ontology structure and its documentation or publication form are different objects. | Separate ontic, ontic-description episteme, publication, and publication form; do not let reusable form or documentation style become the ontology decision. |
| Norouzi, Hertling, Waitelonis, and Sack 2025. | Current process-ODP support: implicit ontology may be carried by process-like publications and needs explicit representation for domain experts. | Distinguish the implicit ontology from the card, table, workflow notation, diagram, or process document that happened to carry it. |
| Nayyeri et al. 2025, and Oyewale and Soru 2026. | Current data-model-to-ontology and enterprise-KG support: schemas, extraction, entailment or hierarchy structuring, provenance, validation, and RDF serialization can reveal ontology candidates but can also hide publication-form overread. | Keep schema, data structure, ontology description, serialization, publication form, and ontic distinct; require bounded scope and validation before a publication form influences ontic selection. |
| OWL, SKOS, RDF, and triple-store practice. | Infrastructure and expression lineage: labels, concept schemes, axioms, published documents, serializations, and queries play different roles. | Use them as expression and publication caution only; they do not substitute for `U.Ontic` and do not prove that labels, tables, or pattern sections decide ontology by appearance. |
| FPF episteme and publication machinery. | `C.2.1` and `E.17` already govern epistemes and publication kits. | E.24.PUB specializes that machinery only for ontic descriptions and avoids duplicating generic semio doctrine. |

Smallest source-currentness reopen trigger: reopen this SoTA slice when newer ontology-publication, data-model-to-ontology, or enterprise-KG work changes the selected distinction among ontology module, ontology-description episteme, serialization, publication form, and source-form overread. Do not reopen it merely because a new serialization format, graph store, or documentation style becomes popular.

### E.24.PUB:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `E.24`, `C.2.1`, `E.17`, `E.17.0`, `E.8`, `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, and `F.19`.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.24.CD` for candidate detection, `A.19` and `A.19.ECS` for characteristic-space descriptions and evaluation construction, `A.22` for structure, `C.30` for architecture, and `C.30.AD` for architecture descriptions.
- **Used by:** subject patterns that need a thin boundary between the subject ontic, its description, and the publication form without turning the pattern into generic semio instruction.
