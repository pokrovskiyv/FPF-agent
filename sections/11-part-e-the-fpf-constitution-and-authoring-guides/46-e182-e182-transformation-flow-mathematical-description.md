## E.18.2 - Transformation Flow Mathematical Description

> **Tech-name:** `TransformationFlowMathematicalDescription`
> **Plain-name:** mathematical description of a transformation-flow structure
> **Type:** Architectural pattern (E)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative
> **Placement:** Part E -> E.18 child pattern
> **Builds on:** `E.18` Transformation Flow Structure, `C.29` Mathematical Lens Use, `C.2.1` `U.Episteme`, `E.17` publication machinery, `A.3.4` `U.Transformation`, `A.6.0` `U.Signature`, `A.6.5` slot discipline, `A.15` work family, `A.20`, `A.21`, and `C.30` architecture family.
> **Purpose:** record how a graph, algebraic, categorical, tuple, path, slice, morphism, quotient, fold, refinement, factorization, wiring, or related mathematical expression describes a selected `TransformationFlowStructure`: what it represents, what it preserves, what it loses, which declared use it serves, and which governing relation carries any stronger project claim.

### E.18.2:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when the current EntityOfConcern is a mathematical description of a selected transformation-flow structure, path, path slice, flow valuation, crossing, or compound transformation arrangement. The description may be a graph, hypergraph, category-theory object, algebra, tuple, matrix, network expression, wiring diagram, morphism family, quotient, fold, refinement, factorization, path relation, slice relation, or another formal expression.

The primary EntityOfConcern is `TransformationFlowMathematicalDescription@Context`: a `C.2.1 U.Episteme` specialization whose described entity is a selected `TransformationFlowStructure` or one selected part of it. E.18.2 does not invent a second local description format. In C.2.1 slot terms, `DescribedTransformationFlowStructureRef` fills the entity-of-concern slot, `CandidateMathObject`, `ExpressionKind`, `MappingMode`, `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, and `DeclaredUse` fill the claim or description-content slots, and `PublicationFaceRef?` stays a publication relation through `E.17`. E.18.2 keeps three values distinct:

| Value under concern | Governing pattern | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| selected compound structure of transformations and adjacent loci | `E.18` | not a mathematical expression merely because it can be described by a graph or algebra |
| mathematical description of that selected structure | `E.18.2` | records represented structure, expression kind, mapping mode, preserved/lost structure, declared use, and the boundary to stronger project claims |
| declared mathematical-lens use and its adequacy | `C.29` | not a local E.18.2 invention; use C.29 fields when adequacy, preserved/lost structure, payoff, or stop condition is claim-bearing |

#### E.18.2:1.1 - Use this when

- a selected `TransformationFlowStructure`, path, slice, crossing, or flow valuation needs a graph, algebra, category, tuple, morphism, quotient, fold, refinement, factorization, wiring, matrix, or network expression;
- a diagram or equation set helps compare composition, decomposition, coarser/finer partitioning, transfer, crossing, refresh, or coupled-flow relations, but the mathematical expression itself must not authorize work;
- a source says "graph", "network", "path", "morphism", "algebra", "category", "workflow", "pipeline", "dataflow", or "functional diagram" and the claim being made is the mathematical description of a selected transformation-flow structure;
- a reader needs to know whether the mathematical expression is only a publication face, a C.29 lens-use claim, an E.18 selected structure claim, or an E.18.2 description claim.

#### E.18.2:1.2 - What goes wrong if missed

A project source or diagram can make a graph-shaped expression look like the flow structure itself. Then mathematical neatness silently becomes evidence, work completion, gate readiness, architecture adequacy, or permission to act. The opposite error is also common: every graph-shaped structure is demoted to "just a diagram", so the selected structure, its slices, and its refresh boundaries disappear.

#### E.18.2:1.3 - What this buys

The practitioner can use mathematical structure without overclaiming it. The record names the represented `TransformationFlowStructure`, the expression used, what the expression preserves, what it loses, the declared use, and the governing relation for any stronger claim.

#### E.18.2:1.4 - Not this pattern when

- the selected compound structure itself is the EntityOfConcern; use `E.18`;
- one bounded transformation is the EntityOfConcern; use `A.3.4`;
- the claim is general mathematical-lens adequacy outside transformation-flow structures; use `C.29`;
- the claim is a publication face or view publication; use `E.17` and the relevant view or architecture-description pattern;
- the claim is work planning, performed work, evidence, assurance, gate fit, gate decision, release, decision, or architecture adequacy; use the direct governing pattern.

### E.18.2:2 - Problem

Transformation-flow structures are often easiest to inspect through mathematics. A graph can expose dependency and reachability, a category can expose composition, a quotient can expose coarser structure, a fold can expose aggregation, a refinement can expose lost detail, a wiring expression can expose interface placement, and a tuple can make slot positions explicit.

Those expressions are useful because they preserve selected structure while ignoring other structure. That same usefulness creates risk. If the expression is treated as the structure itself, the project may believe that a path in a graph proves a possible performed-work order, that a commutative square proves a real bridge, that a fold proves safe aggregation, or that a wiring diagram proves integration readiness.

E.18.2 solves the description problem: it records a mathematical expression over a selected E.18 structure and says what that expression may be used for. It does not decide the world-side structure, the atomic transformation, the work occurrence, the gate, the evidence case, or the architecture claim.

### E.18.2:3 - Forces

| Force | What must be preserved | Pressure to manage |
|---|---|---|
| Mathematical usefulness | Graphs, categories, tuples, algebra, morphisms, paths, slices, quotients, folds, refinements, factorizations, and wiring can expose structure that prose misses. | Mathematical form can look stronger than the claim it can carry. |
| EoC separation | The selected structure, its mathematical description, its publication, and its C.29 lens-use adequacy are different values. | One source artifact may present all of them at once. |
| Composition and decomposition | Compound transformations need reviewable composition, factorization, slice, fold, and refinement claims. | The expression can hide which selected E.18 structure or slice is being described. |
| Publication usability | Readers need diagrams, tables, equations, and views. | A publication face can be mistaken for evidence, gate passage, or performed work. |
| Related-claim economy | C.29, E.18, A.3.4, E.17, A.20, A.21, A.15, and C.30 already govern related claims. | Repeating their boundary doctrine inside E.18.2 creates fanout. |

### E.18.2:4 - Solution

Write a `TransformationFlowMathematicalDescription@Context` only when the mathematical expression changes the current transformation-flow description move. Keep the selected structure reference and the expression relation separate. Then decide whether the C.29 lens-use card is needed for adequacy, payoff, preserved/lost structure, or boundary.

#### E.18.2:4.1 - First-use record

Use this compact record for ordinary cases:

```text
TransformationFlowMathematicalDescription@Context:
  DescribedTransformationFlowStructureRef:
  DescribedSliceOrLocusRef?:
  CandidateMathObject:
  ExpressionKind:
  MappingMode:
  PreservedStructure:
  LostStructure:
  DeclaredUse:
  BoundaryStop:
  C29LensUseRef?:
  PublicationFaceRef?:
  RelatedGovernedClaimRef?:
```

`DescribedTransformationFlowStructureRef` points to the selected E.18 structure. `DescribedSliceOrLocusRef?` names a path, slice, crossing, flow valuation, transformation locus, signature locus, mechanism locus, work-plan locus, work locus, evidence locus, result locus, or refresh locus when the expression describes only part of the structure. `CandidateMathObject` and `ExpressionKind` name the graph, algebra, category, tuple, morphism, quotient, fold, refinement, factorization, wiring, matrix, network, or related mathematical object. `PreservedStructure`, `LostStructure`, `DeclaredUse`, and `BoundaryStop` follow the C.29 discipline when the expression is claim-bearing. `RelatedGovernedClaimRef?` points to the separate relation record only when a stronger claim is being made; it is not a local authority slot.

#### E.18.2:4.2 - Expression families

| Expression family | Use when it describes | Required boundary |
|---|---|---|
| graph, hypergraph, network, DSM, DMM, MDM, or matrix | dependency, transfer, adjacency, interface placement, clustering, or change propagation inside a selected transformation-flow structure | not the selected structure unless E.18 says so; not work occurrence, gate passage, or evidence |
| mathematical path or path slice | reachability, carried relation, currentness slice, refresh locality, or crossing-local replay | not a project procedure or performed sequence |
| tuple, record, slot relation, or typed relation expression | slot positions, relation arity, locus typing, and value placement | not a new U-kind and not a replacement for A.6.5 slot discipline |
| morphism, composition, category, operad, optic, or wiring expression | composition, interface, substitution, transfer law, or decomposition of selected transformations | not proof that the represented work can be performed or that interfaces are semantically compatible |
| quotient, fold, coarsening, refinement, or factorization | coarser/finer partitioning, aggregation, retained/lost structure, and alternative decomposition | not an identity claim without preserved/lost structure and return condition |
| algebra, semiring, equation system, or constraint system | operation law, conservation, admissible composition, or constraint propagation over the selected structure | not a mechanism, formal substrate, or empirical law unless `A.6.0` governs the formal substrate, `A.6.1` governs the postulate or principle frame, and the relevant evidence pattern is current |
| learned representation, embedding, simulation object, or differentiable surrogate | approximate structure, optimization, similarity, or predictive proxy over transformation-flow material | not architecture adequacy, OOD guarantee, causal proof, or release readiness by itself |

These families are prompts for recovery, not a taxonomy of new FPF kinds. A local expression may combine several families; the record still names one selected structure, one current described slice or locus when relevant, and the declared use.

#### E.18.2:4.3 - Four-way discriminator

Use this discriminator before writing or accepting a mathematical description:

```text
If the claim selects or audits the compound structure in the project, use E.18.
If the claim describes that selected structure with mathematics, use E.18.2.
If the claim evaluates the mathematical lens use, use C.29 with an E.18.2 reference.
If the claim publishes a view, diagram, card, table, or equation face, use E.17 and the governing view or architecture-description pattern.
```

The same source may require several records. A refrigerator principle scheme may include a publication face, a functional-architecture view, a selected `TransformationFlowStructure`, a thermodynamic mechanism claim, and a mathematical graph or equation description. E.18.2 writes only the mathematical-description relation. If the same expression is also used as a mathematical lens for world-side adequacy, C.29 governs the lens-use adequacy; if it is only a published face, E.17 governs publication use.


#### E.18.2:4.4 - Related governed claims

E.18.2 does not carry authority for related governed claims. Use the direct governing pattern when the current claim is:

| Current claim | Use |
|---|---|
| one bounded change under conditions | `A.3.4` |
| selected compound structure, flow valuation, path, slice, crossing, or refresh locus | `E.18` |
| mathematical-lens adequacy, preserved/lost structure, payoff, or stop condition | `C.29` |
| method, method description, mechanism, signature, work plan, or performed work | `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, `A.6.1`, `A.6.0`, `A.15.2`, or `A.15.1` |
| evidence, assurance, gate, release, or decision | `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, or `C.11` |
| architecture, structural view, functional structure, module interface, or reusable-structure claim | `C.30`, `C.30.ASV`, `A.6.F`, `A.6.M`, or `C.31` |
| publication face or publication use | `E.17` or `E.17.EFP` |

### E.18.2:4.5 - Archetypal Grounding (Worked Slices)

**Refrigerator principle scheme.** A vapor-compression diagram can be a publication face. The cooling cycle can be a selected `TransformationFlowStructure`. The thermodynamic laws are mechanism or formal-substrate claims. The graph or equation set that describes the cycle is an E.18.2 mathematical description. It may preserve transformation order, heat-transfer constraints, and cycle closure while losing maintenance work, sensor uncertainty, and installation context. It does not prove the refrigerator works or authorize a repair.

**P2W carry-through.** A P2W source may draw a graph-shaped path from formal substrate to principle frame, mechanism position, method selection, work planning, work, and evaluation. The graph-shaped expression can be an E.18.2 description of the selected carry-through structure. The P2W move itself remains `E.18.1`; work planning remains A.15; dated work remains `U.Work`.

**Neural-network dataflow.** A transformer architecture diagram may describe layers, attention blocks, residual connections, and graph-like connection structure. If the current claim is the compound transformation organization, use E.18 or C.30 when it is an architecture claim. If the current claim is the mathematical graph, tensor-shape relation, or wiring expression that describes that organization, use E.18.2. Benchmark superiority, training work, evidence, release, and causal claims require their governing patterns.

**Circuit and algorithm.** A logic-circuit schematic can describe a transformation-flow structure realizing a Boolean relation. The netlist, wiring graph, algebraic normal form, and truth table are different mathematical or formal descriptions. They do not by themselves decide whether the selected method exists, whether the CMOS mechanism is valid under voltage and timing conditions, or whether a dated powered run occurred.

### E.18.2:4.6 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias | How E.18.2 prevents it |
| --- | --- |
| Graph-as-world bias | The selected structure stays with `E.18`; a graph or algebraic object is only the mathematical description unless another governing pattern says otherwise. |
| Path-as-procedure bias | A mathematical path or path slice can express reachability or locality; method and work-plan claims stay with method and work-plan patterns. |
| Diagram-as-architecture bias | Architecture adequacy stays with `C.30`, `C.30.ASV`, and related architecture patterns; E.18.2 records only the mathematical-description relation. |
| Math-as-authority bias | No mathematical expression authorizes work, passes a gate, settles evidence, grants release, or proves assurance by itself. |
| Publication-as-description bias | Publication faces and rendered diagrams stay with `E.17` unless the current EntityOfConcern is the mathematical description itself. |

### E.18.2:5 - Conformance checklist

- `CC-E18.2-1` The current EntityOfConcern is `TransformationFlowMathematicalDescription@Context`, not the selected `TransformationFlowStructure` itself.
- `CC-E18.2-2` The described selected structure or slice is named by `DescribedTransformationFlowStructureRef` and, when needed, `DescribedSliceOrLocusRef`.
- `CC-E18.2-3` The mathematical expression family is named without minting a new U-kind.
- `CC-E18.2-4` Preserved structure, lost structure, declared use, and boundary stop are named when the expression is claim-bearing.
- `CC-E18.2-5` C.29 is used when mathematical-lens adequacy, payoff, obstruction, preserved/lost structure, or stop condition is being evaluated beyond the local description relation.
- `CC-E18.2-6` Graph, path, slice, morphism, algebra, category, tuple, quotient, fold, refinement, factorization, and wiring language stays mathematical-description language unless another governing pattern explicitly makes the selected structure current.
- `CC-E18.2-7` No mathematical expression proves work occurrence, authorizes action, passes a gate, settles evidence, or establishes architecture adequacy by itself.
- `CC-E18.2-8` Publication faces are separated from mathematical description and handled through `E.17` when publication is current.
- `CC-E18.2-9` When work, method, mechanism, signature, evidence, gate, decision, architecture, function, module-interface, or reusable-structure claims are current, apply the direct pattern governing that claim. E.18.2 records only the mathematical-description relation for the selected transformation-flow structure.
- `CC-E18.2-10` A source artifact that carries several claims is split into records by current EntityOfConcern and relation position, not by the artifact's name.

### E.18.2:6 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Repair |
|---|---|
| **Graph-as-world.** A graph-shaped expression is treated as the project-world structure because it is visually convincing. | Name whether the current EoC is E.18 selected structure, E.18.2 mathematical description, E.17 publication, or C.29 lens-use adequacy. |
| **Path-as-procedure.** A mathematical path or path slice is read as a required project procedure. | Keep it as a mathematical relation over a selected structure; use method or work-plan patterns for procedures. |
| **Algebra-as-mechanism.** An operation law or equation system is treated as a realized mechanism. | Use A.6.0 for formal substrate and A.6.1 for mechanism claims; keep E.18.2 to the expression relation. |
| **Fold-as-identity.** A quotient, fold, or coarsening erases detail and is then used as if nothing was lost. | State preserved structure, lost structure, and return condition; use C.29 when the adequacy of the fold matters. |
| **Diagram-as-architecture adequacy.** A clean diagram is treated as proof that the architecture is good. | Use `C.30` for the architecture claim, `C.30.ASV` for architecture structural-view adequacy, and `C.31` for reusable-structure characteristics; `E.18.2` only describes selected structure mathematically. |

### E.18.2:7 - Consequences

| Consequence | Benefit | Cost or mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Mathematical descriptions get their own local record. | Graphs, paths, slices, quotients, and wiring can be used without becoming hidden ontology. | One source artifact may need several records. |
| E.18 stays about selected structure. | Compound transformation organization remains inspectable in the project world. | Readers must choose E.18 or E.18.2 by current EoC. |
| C.29 remains general. | E.18.2 does not duplicate the whole mathematical-lens pattern. | Claim-bearing adequacy needs a C.29 reference. |
| Boundary to work, gates, evidence, and architecture is explicit. | Mathematical prestige does not replace project checks. | Stronger claims require the direct governing pattern. |

### E.18.2:8 - Rationale

Graph-shaped or morphism-shaped source labels do not carry current ontology by themselves here. They remain useful only when the current EntityOfConcern is named: E.18 keeps selected compound structure, A.3.4 keeps bounded transformation, E.18.1 keeps P2W carry-through, and E.18.2 keeps mathematical descriptions of selected transformation-flow structures.

The pattern is intentionally narrower than C.29. C.29 answers the general question "is this mathematical lens use adequate for this declared purpose?" E.18.2 answers the local question "what mathematical expression describes this selected transformation-flow structure, and which declared use does that expression serve here?" This prevents shadow math-lens doctrine while preserving the practical value of graph, path, category, tuple, and algebraic expression in transformation-flow work.

### E.18.2:9 - SoTA-Echoing

| Practice tradition | Distinction kept for E.18.2 | E.18.2 invariant | Practitioner implication | Return if |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model-based systems and architecture-description practice (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022, [`iso.org/standard/74393`](https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html); SysML v2 current specification lineage). | A diagram or model can describe a selected structure without becoming the structure or evidence. | Mathematical description names described structure, expression, preserved/lost structure, declared use, and boundary stop. | A clean model can guide inspection without authorizing action. | The selected E.18 structure, publication face, evidence relation, or architecture claim changes. |
| Applied category theory, wiring diagrams, and graph rewriting (Fong & Spivak, arXiv [`1803.05316`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316); Spivak, arXiv [`1305.0297`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0297); Baez & Fong, arXiv [`1504.05625`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05625); Bonchi et al., arXiv [`1602.06771`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06771); Patterson/Spivak/Vagner, arXiv [`2101.12046`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12046)). | Formal expression is useful because it preserves some structure and drops other structure. | Quotient, fold, refinement, factorization, and wiring claims name what survives and what is lost. | Coarser and finer descriptions can be compared without pretending they are identical. | The preserved/lost structure, mapping mode, or C.29 lens-use adequacy changes. |
| Digital-thread, research-object, and source-reference practice (RO-Crate paper, arXiv [`2108.06503`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06503); Di Cosmo/Gruenpeter/Zacchiroli, arXiv [`2001.08647`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08647); ISO 23247 digital-twin lineage). | Replay works only when record kinds remain distinct. | E.18.2 descriptions cite E.18 structures and related governed records rather than absorbing work, evidence, gate, and publication claims. | A trace graph can remain useful without becoming proof, plan, or performed work. | Source currentness, work-family law, evidence, gate, or publication-use relation changes. |
| Engineering architecture practice uses functional, dataflow, and interface diagrams under explicit view, viewpoint, and correspondence discipline. | A diagram may describe architecture, transformation-flow structure, method, mechanism, or publication face according to the current EoC. | E.18.2 keeps only the mathematical-description relation; architecture adequacy remains under `C.30`, architecture structural-view adequacy remains under `C.30.ASV`, and reusable-structure characteristics remain under `C.31`. | Functional and dataflow diagrams can be used without semio-bias or architecture overclaim. | The architecture selected structure, viewpoint, or correspondence relation changes. |
