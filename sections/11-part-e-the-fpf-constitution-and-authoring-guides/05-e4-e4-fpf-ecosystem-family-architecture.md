## E.4 - FPF Ecosystem Family Architecture

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative.

### E.4:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when an FPF user, framework author, or steward needs to create, extend, or use an FPF-grounded pattern ecosystem and must know what belongs to FPF itself, what belongs to the FPF Core, what belongs to a domain or local framework, which records carry relation and edition claims, and which neighboring patterns contain the defining content for publication, access, naming, source, currentness, and quality work.

Primary `EntityOfConcern`: the FPF-grounded pattern ecosystem for one named ecosystem question and intended map use. The first useful output is a family-and-structure map that names the framework family members, selected architecture-relevant structures, recurring problem-situation structures, reusable solution-move structures, dependency direction, edition boundary, publication carriers, access carriers, and patterns to use for source, currentness, quality, and decision claims.

This pattern buys a practical distinction: a reader can tell whether a claim changes FPF itself as a first-principles framework edition, changes the FPF Core, creates a domain principle framework, creates a local practice framework, publishes or teaches existing content, exposes a skill or MCP access carrier, or records a dependency on another framework edition. Use `E.4.FPF` when the work is the form of FPF itself; use `E.11` and `E.17` for first-entry and publication questions; use `E.4.DPF` when the work is to author a domain or local framework.

### E.4:2 - Problem

FPF has grown from a single core pattern set into an ecosystem of core rules, tools, companions, domain frameworks, local practice frameworks, source packs, decisions, quality records, publication carriers, and access carriers. If those objects are described only by file names, abbreviations, or reader-facing tables of contents, several different kinds collapse:

- a pattern set is treated as a publication or access carrier;
- a local practice framework is treated as an FPF Core amendment;
- a relation record is treated as a method order;
- a dependency on a framework edition is treated as a specialization relation;
- a source or generated carrier is treated as architecture evidence without source-return and preservation claims.

The result is a framework that may look organized but cannot answer ordinary architecture questions: what structure is selected, what depends on what, what can change independently, what is preserved by a projection, and which stronger claim requires another pattern before it is used.

### E.4:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Core stability | The FPF Core must stay stable enough to supply dependable constraints to downstream frameworks, while domain and local frameworks need faster evolution. |
| Reuse and source-local meaning | Domain and local frameworks should reuse FPF Core distinctions, but they must not silently redefine Core meaning or treat a local label as a universal premise. |
| Publication pressure | Readers need all-in-one carriers, tables of contents, cards, examples, and first-entry material, but those carriers do not by themselves settle architecture. |
| Relation richness | Pattern ecosystems need recommendation, specialization, dependency, publication, preservation, evaluation, and source-use relations, but a single "related patterns" list hides the relation function. |
| Source and generation pressure | Source summaries, relation graphs, and generated candidate sets speed work, but their losses and admissible use must be declared before architecture work relies on them. |
| Problem-solving primacy | Frameworks need vocabulary and ontology, but a DPF is valuable only when those distinctions help a practitioner recognize typical problem situations and choose stronger solution moves. |
| Evolution pressure | Framework editions, dependencies, and names change over time, so compatibility, deprecation, supersession, and refresh conditions must be explicit. |

### E.4:4 - Solution

Describe an FPF-grounded pattern ecosystem as a family of framework editions and publication/access carriers over selected structures. For every claim, state the exact subject and relation and cite the defining or constraining ClaimGraph in its subject pattern. A principle framework edition is not merely a bundle of documents, an ontology catalogue, a literature survey, or a guide to talking about a domain. Its pattern language renders a selected architecture of recurring problem situations, forces, known failure modes, reusable SoTA solution moves, consequences, cases, relation records, evaluation methods, and refresh conditions for a declared reader and use. Known failure modes include beginner mistakes and experienced-practitioner failures caused by stale, local-only, or non-SoTA practice.

Create a family-and-structure map with these fields:

```text
FPFFamilyAndStructureMap@Context:
  ecosystemScopeRef
  intendedMapUse
  claimScopeRef?
  sourceRefs?
  patternHostRefs?
  selectedArchitectureStructureRefs?
  publicationRelationRefs?
  boundedModelUseStructureRef?
  frameworkFamilyMembers
  selectedPatternSetRefs
  selectedProblemSituationStructureRefs
  selectedKnownFailureModeRefs
  selectedSoTASolutionMoveRefs
  selectedSolutionMoveStructureRefs
  selectedRelationRecordRefs
  frameworkCarrierRenderingRefs
  selectedDependencyAndEditionRefs
  selectedPublicationOrAccessCarrierRefs
  selectedSourcePackRefs
  selectedDecisionRefs
  qualityAndImprovementRefs
  currentnessAndRefreshRefs
  blockedOverreadRefs
  dependentUsePatternLocators
```

This map answers the declared ecosystem question for its intended use. It is not a new root kind, a source of semantic locality, or a substitute for the subject claims and patterns it cites.

Classify the family members as follows:

`Conceptual Core` is the legacy authority and publication-family partition. `First Principles Framework edition` is the whole scoped FPF framework edition as a transdisciplinary first-principles framework. `FPF Core pattern set` is the framework-edition view of the general FPF Core used for dependency, relation, and edition reasoning. These are related views and scopes, not competing core objects.

| Family member | Architecture contribution | Authoritative content loci |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conceptual Core | Core FPF distinctions, rules, and patterns that other FPF-grounded frameworks depend on. | `E.4`, `E.5.3`, and the exact subject patterns containing the defining ClaimGraphs |
| Tooling Reference | Optional tools, schemas, scripts, machine checks, or helper publications that inspect or support FPF use. | Use `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source, `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, bounded use, and availability, and relevant tool patterns for their declared tool functions; use `G.5` only for a selector-facing selected-tool-set result declaration. |
| Pedagogical Companion | Tutorials, playbooks, worked examples, and learning material that teach FPF without changing Core meaning. | `E.17`, didactic patterns |
| Foundational principle pattern set | Foundational threshold material or principle patterns that may support FPF-grounded use but need settled names and dependency boundaries. | `F.18`, `E.4.PFR` |
| First Principles Framework edition | The scoped FPF framework edition as a transdisciplinary first-principles framework with Core pattern set, publication/access carriers, relation records, and whole-FPF adequacy route. | `E.4.FPF`, `E.2.DA`, `E.4.PFR`, `E.11`, `E.17`, `G.11` |
| FPF Core pattern set | The current general FPF pattern core as a framework edition. | `E.4`, `E.5.3`, and the current Core subject-pattern descriptions and defining ClaimGraphs |
| Domain principle framework | A domain-bounded framework grounded in FPF and in domain SoTA. | `E.4.DPF`, `G.2`, `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR` |
| Local practice framework | A framework for one bounded local practice setting—for example a project, organization, workflow, tool, practitioner position, or audience—grounded in FPF and often in a domain framework. Add a local system-role kind, a separate System-classification judgment, or an exact assignment occurrence only when the framework claim independently uses it; recover ambiguous *role* wording through `E.10.ROLE`. | `E.4.DPF`, `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR`, `G.11` |

The ordinary method is:

1. Declare the ecosystem scope and intended map use. Cite the exact source, pattern host, selected architecture structure, publication relation, or bounded model-use structure only when the map actually relies on it.
2. Name the family member being created, used, or changed.
3. List the selected structures that matter for the architecture claim: recurring problem-situation structures, known failure modes, reusable SoTA solution-move structures, pattern set, pattern-use relations, pattern-framework relations, decision records, dependency and edition records, publication/access carriers, source packs, quality records, and currentness records. For PF work, the pattern-language publication carrier exposes a reader-facing expression of that problem-and-solution architecture, not a neutral list of topics.
4. If the family member is FPF itself as a framework edition, open `E.4.FPF` for form, publication/access carriers, and whole-FPF adequacy routing.
5. Apply `E.5.3`: dependencies point toward more stable framework editions. FPF Core does not depend on domain or local frameworks.
6. State publication and first-entry claims using `E.11` and `E.17`; state framework-carrier structure-account assertions using `E.4.FPF` for FPF itself or `E.4.DPF`/`E.4.DPF.DA` for domain and local frameworks.
7. State pattern-use recommendation claims using `E.11.PUR`.
8. When a framework-architecture question is open, record the selected answer in one `E.9` DRR and use `E.4.PFAD` to profile its framework-specific content. Use `C.32.PAD` only for an exact project architecture decision and `C.32.ADR` only to project such a decision into an ADR-like publication.
9. State relation, dependency, compatibility, deprecation, and edition claims using `E.4.PFR` only when its named maintenance use requires that representation; otherwise use the direct subject assertion.
10. Settle names using `F.18`.
11. State SoTA and source-use claims using `G.2`.
12. State currentness, refresh, and edition-change claims using `G.11`, the exact edition values, and their source/currentness assertions.
13. Before using an all-in-one carrier, table of contents, relation graph, summary, skill pack, MCP-backed service, or generated carrier as evidence, state the exact source-return or preservation assertion under the predicate defined in `C.33`, `C.34`, or `C.35`.
14. Evaluate whole-FPF adequacy through `E.2.DA`, DPF or local-framework package adequacy through `E.4.DPF.DA`, individual pattern quality through `E.21`, improve through `E.23`, and use `E.19` only when the local process asks for admission review.

Use this routing table when a proposed change is ambiguous:

| Proposed work | Route to | Blocked overread |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The form of FPF itself changes: README, Preface, ToC, monolith, host set, skill pack, MCP-backed access, or whole-FPF publication/access route. | `E.4.FPF`, with `E.2.DA` for whole-FPF adequacy and `E.4.PFR` for relation or edition records. | Do not treat FPF as a DPF, do not use `E.4.DPF.DA` for whole-FPF adequacy, and do not treat a carrier as the framework edition. |
| Accepted changes are being assembled into an FPF, DPF, or LPF publication, or continuity with a predecessor publication is claimed. | `E.4.PFIP` for the accepted-source and predecessor-preservation comparisons. | Require both PFIP conclusions when both claims are made. Source parity, build success, carrier continuity, and package adequacy answer narrower questions. |
| A distinction or rule is intended to constrain ordinary FPF use across many domains and downstream frameworks depend on it. | FPF Core amendment through the current campaign and the exact subject patterns containing the changed assertions. | Do not promote a local checklist or domain technique to Core merely because it is useful. |
| A reusable principle supports FPF-grounded work but is not a general Core rule for all domains. | Foundational principle pattern set or other named framework edition, with `E.4.PFR` dependency records. | Do not hide a new framework edition inside the Core table of contents. |
| A source tradition or professional domain needs FPF-shaped patterns. | Domain principle framework through `E.4.DPF`, `G.2`, `E.4.PFAD`, and `E.4.PFR`. | Do not treat a literature summary as the framework. |
| One bounded local practice setting—for example a project, organization, workflow, tool, practitioner position, or audience—needs guidance. | Local practice framework through `E.4.DPF`; keep local source, publication, quality, and refresh records, and state separately any direct relation used for maintenance, responsibility, authority, assignment, or contact. If a load-bearing owner label has no current direct relation, return `missing-governor` instead of inventing one. | Do not make local policy a general FPF rule. |
| Existing material is hard to find, teach, or publish. | Use `E.11` for discovery, the relevant didactic pattern for teaching, `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source, and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, bounded use, and availability. Use `G.5` only when the missing value is a selected-set result declaration. | Do not call publication repair architecture repair. |
| A cross-reference claims use, specialization, dependency, publication, source reuse, preservation, quality, deprecation, or supersession. | `E.4.PFR` for the relation function and edition effect. | Do not let a link label decide the relation meaning. |
| A framework split, dependency boundary, publication/access carrier, or adoption consequence must be decided. | Record one selected answer in an `E.9` DRR, using `E.4.PFAD` for its framework-specific content. Use `C.32.PAD` only when the decision is an exact project architecture decision and `C.32.ADR` only for its ADR-like projection. | Do not replace the answer with a diagram, folder, manifest, PFAD relation, or project-specific decision pattern used as the default framework route. |
| A source, search result, transformed view, or generated carrier supplies candidate material. | `G.2`, `C.33`, `C.34`, or `C.35` before architecture use. | Do not treat a carrier as authoritative because it has plausible names. |
| Whole-FPF adequacy, DPF package adequacy, individual pattern quality, repeated improvement, admission gating, or currentness is the live problem. | `E.2.DA`, `E.4.DPF.DA`, `E.21`, `E.23`, `E.19`, and `G.11` according to the claim. | Do not average pattern scores into package adequacy or whole-FPF adequacy, and do not run all quality gates when only one evaluation or refresh question is live. |

This pattern should leave the reader with one architecture sentence: "This framework edition belongs to this family member, expresses this selected architecture of recurring problems and solution moves in pattern-language form, depends on these stable editions, publishes or gives access through these carriers, preserves these selected structures, and states each neighboring claim under its exact predicate or constraint with the subject pattern available as a locator."

### E.4:5 - Archetypal Grounding

Tell: A team creating a hydroponic-cucumber domain principle framework should not place every useful crop-growing rule into `FPF-Spec.md`. It creates a domain framework edition grounded in FPF Core and horticulture SoTA, declares its dependency on an FPF Core edition, records its source packs, drafts domain patterns under `E.8`, and publishes an all-in-one publication carrier for growers or agronomists.

Mini-example:

| Map field | Filled slice |
| --- | --- |
| `ecosystemScopeRef` | `HydroponicCucumberPrincipleFramework@GreenhouseCropDomain` |
| `intendedMapUse` | choose the framework-family, dependency, and publication architecture for the hydroponic-cucumber framework edition |
| `sourceRefs?` | source entries cited by `GreenhouseControlSourcePack@2026Q2` and `CropProductionSourcePack@2026Q2` |
| `patternHostRefs?` | `DPF.GROW.NutrientSolutionMonitoring` and `DPF.GROW.ClimateControlInterpretation` |
| `selectedArchitectureStructureRefs?` | recurring crop-growing problem situations, solution moves, dependency direction, and source-return structure used by this map |
| `publicationRelationRefs?` | the publication relations from `HydroponicCucumberPF@2026Q3` to `GrowerCarrier@2026Q3` and `GrowerReadme@2026Q3` |
| `frameworkFamilyMembers` | domain principle framework; local grower practice framework as a later dependent edition |
| `selectedPatternSetRefs` | crop-growth problem framing, nutrient-solution monitoring, climate-control interpretation, harvest-quality feedback patterns |
| `selectedRelationRecordRefs` | source or decision reuse from horticulture source pack; specialization from general FPF authoring patterns; publication relation to all-in-one carrier |
| `selectedDependencyAndEditionRefs` | depends on `FPFCorePatternSet@Edition`; no reverse dependency from FPF Core |
| `selectedPublicationOrAccessCarrierRefs` | domain all-in-one publication carrier plus readme as first-entry carrier |
| `selectedSourcePackRefs` | greenhouse-control and crop-production `G.2` source packs |
| `qualityAndImprovementRefs` | `E.21` pattern-quality evaluation and `E.23` improvement loop for drafted domain patterns |
| `currentnessAndRefreshRefs` | `G.11` refresh condition when source pack, Core edition, or crop-production practice changes |
| `blockedOverreadRefs` | do not read the publication carrier as the architecture itself; do not read domain patterns as FPF Core changes |

Show: A Codex-process local practice framework may depend on FPF Core and selected architecture-domain patterns. Its handoff patterns, prelanding patterns, and process runbooks can be local framework material. They do not define the FPF Core merely because they use FPF vocabulary and are useful to this workspace.

Show: A generated relation graph over pattern names can help inspect missing relation records. It becomes architecture input only after `C.35` admits the carrier and `E.4.PFR` records the relation functions. The graph's shape alone is not the ecosystem architecture.

### E.4:6 - Bias-Annotation

The recurrent drift is publication-first architecture: the visible file, all-in-one carrier, card deck, table of contents, or graph is treated as the architecture because it is what a reader sees first. The repair is to name the selected structures and dependency direction first, then use publication patterns to expose them.

Another recurrent drift is Core absorption: useful domain or local material is pulled into the Core because it is well written or broadly reusable. The repair is to ask which domain or local situation the claim addresses and which framework edition should depend on which more stable edition.

### E.4:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Passing condition |
| --- | --- |
| CC-E4.1 Family member named | The work names whether it concerns Core, Tooling Reference, Pedagogical Companion, foundational principle pattern set, First Principles Framework edition, FPF Core, domain principle framework, or local practice framework. |
| CC-E4.2 Selected structures named | The family-and-structure map names its intended use and the problem-situation, known-failure, SoTA solution-move, pattern-set, relation, decision, publication, access, source, quality, dependency, and currentness structures that matter for the claim. Cite a source, pattern host, publication relation, or bounded model-use structure only when the map uses that independently established value. |
| CC-E4.3 E.5.3 respected | Dependency direction points toward more stable framework editions, and Core does not depend on domain or local frameworks. |
| CC-E4.4 Publication/access separated | All-in-one carriers, tables of contents, cards, readmes, skill packs, MCP-backed routes, retrieval routes, assistant integrations, and views are distinct publication, access, or discoverability records; apply the relevant pattern to each claim about them. |
| CC-E4.5 Exact predicate and assertion named | Pattern-use, relation, dependency, decision, naming, source, currentness, quality, and preservation claims each name their exact predicate and subject assertion; a pattern identifier is only the locator for the next question's defining or constraining ClaimGraph. |
| CC-E4.6 Source-return present | Any carrier used as architecture evidence states captured structure, lost structure, admissible use, and the source to return to. |
| CC-E4.7 Framework carrier structure-account explicit | README, Preface, ToC, all-in-one carrier, skill pack, MCP route, or other framework carrier states which framework structures its publication or access expression exposes for whom; missing form or adequacy content is repaired as an exact assertion using `E.4.FPF`, `E.4.DPF`, or `E.4.DPF.DA` before adoption or adequacy claims are made. |

### E.4:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core absorption | A domain or local framework is placed into the FPF Core because it is useful. | Create a separate framework edition with dependency records under `E.4.PFR`. |
| File tree or package map as architecture | A folder layout, package descriptor, or manifest is read as the ecosystem architecture. | Use the file or manifest only as a carrier; recover the family-and-structure map, relation records, dependency records, source packs, quality records, publication/access carriers, and refresh routes. |
| Publication-only architecture | A table of contents or all-in-one carrier is used as the architecture description. | Add a family-and-structure map and source-return note, then constitute the exact practical-entry and publication assertions under the predicates defined in `E.11` and `E.17`. |
| Ontology or talk guide as framework | A framework names domain entities, terms, or conversation moves but does not identify recurring domain problems, known failure modes, SoTA solution moves, and worked repairs. | Keep the ontology, glossary, or communication guide as support material; create or repair the framework around problem situations, solution moves, cases, and quality routes. |
| Relation flattening | Every cross-reference is treated as the same relation. | Use `E.4.PFR` to state relation function and subject pattern. |
| Source-carrier authority | A summary, graph, or generated candidate set is treated as authoritative. | Admit the carrier through `C.35` or record preservation through `C.33` and `C.34` before use. |

### E.4:9 - Consequences

This pattern makes FPF ecosystem work slower at the beginning because a framework author must name family membership, dependency direction, selected structures, and the patterns needed for neighbouring claims. The gain is that later work can evolve without hidden Core changes, hidden publication substitutions, or hidden source loss.

It also makes some attractive names and short labels provisional until `F.18` settles them. That cost is intentional: short names are useful only after the value being named, its source-local meaning, and its intended use are explicit.

### E.4:10 - Rationale

The ecosystem needs architecture because FPF patterns, frameworks, source packs, publication carriers, access carriers, quality records, and decisions are not one kind of object. A file tree cannot preserve the differences among those objects. A relation graph cannot preserve decision rationale or dependency compatibility. An all-in-one publication carrier or callable access carrier cannot preserve all source-return and currentness obligations by itself. Architecture work must therefore name the selected structures and apply the relevant pattern to claims outside this pattern's scope.

The old Core, Tooling Reference, and Pedagogical Companion distinction remains valuable, but it is only one family partition. Domain and local principle frameworks need their own framework editions so they can depend on Core without redefining it.

### E.4:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Claim | Exact source ref and status | Pattern locus changed | Adoption status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture descriptions separate architecture expression from the architecture and require concern, view, viewpoint, correspondence, and rationale discipline. | `ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022, Software, systems and enterprise - Architecture description`, official current standard ref, `https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html`. | `Solution` distinguishes family-and-structure map from publication carriers; `Common Anti-Patterns` repairs publication-only architecture; `Relations` cites the exact neighboring assertions and subject-pattern locators in `C.30`, `C.33`, `C.34`, `E.11`, and `E.17`. | Adopt the separation and correspondence discipline; adapt it to selected structures of a holonic FPF pattern ecosystem. |
| Reuse across related family members needs reusable core assets, variation, adoption, tooling, and evolution discipline. | Nazar, `Software Product Line Engineering: Adoption, Tooling and AI Era Challenges`, arXiv:2605.21353, 2026 current survey and reopen trigger for stronger post-2026 SPLE synthesis, `https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.21353`. | Family table separates FPF Core, domain frameworks, and local frameworks; `E.5.3` dependency direction is made a conformance check. | Adapt reusable-core and variation discipline; reject feature-model or software-product ontology as universal FPF architecture. |
| Pattern ecosystems need validation, worked cases, and relation clarity rather than recipe-book pattern lists. | Riehle, Harutyunyan, Barcomb, `Pattern Discovery and Validation Using Scientific Research Methods`, arXiv:2107.06065, 2021 current validation-practice source; Iba, `Pattern Languages as Media for the Creative Society`, arXiv:1308.1178, lineage for pattern-language social use. | `Archetypal Grounding` now includes a filled map slice; `Conformance Checklist` and anti-pattern rows require source-return, exact relation definitions, and explicit repair conditions. | Adopt validation and example pressure; adapt it through `E.21`, `E.23`, worked slices, and near-miss repairs. |
| Relation-rich architecture should be read as relation constraints, not performed-work order. | `Modelica Language Specification 3.6`, Modelica Association, current maintained language-spec analogy, `https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.6/MLS.pdf`. | Boundary wording in `Solution`, `Rationale`, and `E.4.PFR` keeps relation records declarative and blocks performed-work-order reading. | Use as analogy only; reject equations, solvers, simulation, class-model semantics, and acausal-language ontology for FPF. |

### E.4:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `E.2/P-5 FPF Layering` and `E.5.3` for modular extension, directed dependency, and family-order discipline.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.FPF` when the work concerns FPF itself as a first-principles framework edition, its publication/access carriers, and whole-FPF adequacy route.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.2.DA` when the scoped FPF object needs whole-FPF Pillar adequacy evaluation.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.PFAD` when the family-and-structure map opens a framework-architecture question; `E.4.PFAD` profiles the framework-specific content, `E.9` supplies the decision-record method and content requirements, and the resulting DRR records the selected answer.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.DPF` when the work is to author a domain principle framework or local practice framework.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.PFR` when a relation, edition, dependency, compatibility, deprecation, or preservation claim must be recorded.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.4.DPF.DA` when a domain or local framework package must be evaluated as a package rather than as an average of its pattern bodies.
- **Coordinates with:** `E.11` for discoverability, `E.11.PUR` for pattern-use recommendation, `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source, and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, bounded use, and availability.
- **Coordinates with:** `G.2`, `G.11`, `C.33`, `C.34`, and `C.35` for source, currentness, preservation, and produced-carrier admission claims.
