## E.17.2 - `TEVB` - Typical Engineering Viewpoints Bundle
> **Type:** Part E viewpoint-bundle species pattern
> **Status:** Stable
**Use this when.** A team needs a small reusable set of engineering viewpoints for a holon so that functional, procedural, allocation-responsibility, and module-interface descriptions stay comparable across diagrams, models, cards, and architecture-description bundles.

**First output.** One TEVB bundle use naming `VF.TEVB.ENG`, the selected holon as `EntityOfConcernRef`, the active `VP.*` viewpoint, and the bounded description or specification-use case being written or checked.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Engineering views, publication faces, diagrams, and architecture-specific views collapse into one label, so functional, procedural, allocation-responsibility, and module-interface material cannot be compared safely.

**What this buys.** TEVB gives a compact engineering viewpoint bundle for holons while leaving architecture-specific view adequacy, publication form, role assignment, method, work, and module-interface claims with their direct owners.

**Not this pattern when.** If the current question is architecture structural-view adequacy, architecture description adequacy, publication-form behavior, role assignment, method or work alignment, or module-interface relation repair, use the governing pattern and keep TEVB only as the viewpoint-bundle reference when current.

> **Tech‑name:** `TEVB` (Typical Engineering Viewpoints Bundle, bundle id `VF.TEVB.ENG`)
> **Plain‑name:** typical engineering viewpoints bundle for holons
> **Tag:** Archetypal species of `U.ViewpointBundle` for engineering holons

**Status.** Stable; archetypal, notation‑agnostic species of `U.ViewpointBundle` / `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`.
It is an engineering‑level bundle over holons; it does not itself constitute an architecture framework or architecture‑specific viewpoint library. Architecture‑focused viewpoint bundles are introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species that may import TEVB.

**Builds on.**
* **E.17.0 — `U.MultiViewDescribing`.** Supplies the generic notion of `U.Viewpoint`, `U.View`, and `ViewFamily` over an `EntityOfConcernClass ⊑ U.Entity` (here: `EntityOfConcernClass = U.Holon`).
* **E.17.1 — `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`.** Provides the generic `U.ViewpointBundle`/`ViewFamilyId` structure; TEVB is a concrete bundle (`VF.TEVB.ENG`) in the core library.
* **A.1 — Holon.** Holon kinds `U.System` and `U.Episteme` as the typical engineering entities of concern.
* **A.6.2–A.6.4 — Episteme morphisms.** `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`, `U.EpistemicViewing`, `U.EpistemicRetargeting` as the generic morphism classes behind engineering views.
* **A.7 and E.10.D2 - Strict Distinction: EntityOfConcern, Description episteme, and Description episteme admitted for specification use.** TEVB uses DescriptionContext; engineering descriptions and specifications under TEVB are Description epistemes and specification-use cases with explicit `ViewpointRef`.
* **C.2.1 — `U.EpistemeSlotRelation`.** Provides `EntityOfConcernSlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot` and the slot discipline (A.6.5) used by TEVB-aligned Description epistemes and specification-use Description epistemes.

**Used by.**
* **E.18:5.12 — transformation-flow viewpoint-family map.** As a canonical consumer, `E.18` binds its engineering transformation-flow families (Functional, Procedural, allocation-responsibility or device-structure, Module-Interface) to TEVB viewpoints `VP.Functional`, `VP.Procedural`, `VP.AllocationResponsibility`, `VP.ModuleInterface`.
* **E.17 (MVPK).** Publication of engineering morphisms uses TEVB engineering viewpoints on the Description-episteme and specification-use side and separate publication-side viewpoints over publication faces and forms.
* **Engineering description and specification-use patterns.** System, method, module-interface, and allocation-responsibility-related Description-episteme and specification-use patterns for holons (`U.System`, `U.Episteme`) refer to TEVB when declaring their `ViewpointRef`.
* **ISO-aligned architecture-description bundles.** Architecture-specific viewpoint-bundle species reuse TEVB as the canonical engineering view family (Functional vs Structural etc.) over systems and their epistemes.

**Guard (lexical & ontological).**
**Selected-family scope.** TEVB's engineering viewpoints are scoped by `EntityOfConcernClass = U.Holon` with usual `U.System` and `U.Episteme` cases. ISO 42010 concern, viewpoint, and view language is used as architecture-description practice alignment, not as imported FPF ontology.

1. **Engineering scope only.** TEVB applies to `EntityOfConcernClass = U.Holon` with typical cases `U.System` and `U.Episteme`. Using TEVB viewpoints for non‑holonic entities (e.g., pure data structures, abstract theories) requires an explicit species‑level justification; by default it is a conformance violation.
2. **Viewpoint vs publication faces, forms, and carriers.** `VP.Functional`, `VP.Procedural`, `VP.AllocationResponsibility`, `VP.ModuleInterface` are **viewpoints** (`U.Viewpoint` specifications), not publication face, publication form, rendering, or carrier names. A conforming TEVB use keeps `{PlainView, TechCard, NormsCard, InteropCard, AssuranceLane, ...}` as publication faces and publication forms under MVPK and does not use `VP.*` ids as carrier or publication-form ids.
3. **EngineeringVPId vs publication-side viewpoint id.** `VP.*` in this pattern are **EngineeringVPId** values (E.18:5.12). MVPK publication uses separate publication-side viewpoint ids, linked to TEVB viewpoints only through correspondences.
4. **No new role coordinates in EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary and specification-use discipline.** TEVB may name stakeholder or audience families, and the `VP.AllocationResponsibility` id may name a viewpoint, but TEVB does not introduce a new allocation-responsibility root kind, `U.Role`, or `U.RoleAssignment` as coordinates in Description episteme or specification-use case signatures (E.10.D2). Work-facing roles, holders, assignments, method alignment, performed work, and role names remain governed by `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.15`, and Part F role-description or naming patterns.
5. **EntityOfConcern retention.** In ordinary TEVB use, `DescriptionContext.EntityOfConcernRef` remains the holon selected by `EntityOfConcernClassSpec`. Capability, Method, procedure terms, control-logic terms, role-assignment and responsibility structure, structural architecture, module, interface, and allocation terms are viewpoint concern and content inside the Description episteme unless the text explicitly opens A.6.4 retargeting with a KindBridge and species-extension rule.

   When `EntityOfConcernRef` is `U.Episteme`, role-assignment or responsibility statements in a TEVB view govern systems or acting holons around that episteme, such as authors, maintainers, users, assurers, or transformers. They do not make the episteme itself hold a work-facing role. Episteme-side participation is expressed through C.2.1 slots, source-use relations, publication-use relations, or viewpoint concern unless a governing work-facing pattern explicitly introduces a system or acting-holon role assignment.

6. **No extra viewpoints inside TEVB.** TEVB defines a **fixed core set** of four engineering viewpoints. Other labels such as assurance-oriented, interoperability-oriented, information-oriented or data-oriented, operational-oriented or deployment-oriented, and mission-oriented or context-oriented may appear only as **lexical family labels** in E.18:5.12 (for example, as `ViewFamilyId` and `AliasInViewFamilies` values for transformation-flow species). They do not extend `TEVB.EngBundle.viewpoints` and are not additional `U.Viewpoint` kinds in this bundle; when SoTA or local practice demands explicit assurance, information, or mission viewpoints, provide them as **separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species** imported alongside TEVB rather than by mutating `VF.TEVB.ENG`.
7. **Not an architecture framework.** TEVB is an engineering‑level viewpoint bundle; architecture‑specific viewpoint bundles and architecture frameworks must be introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species that may import TEVB. They keep `VF.TEVB.ENG` as the engineering viewpoint bundle and put architecture-only viewpoints in separate architecture-specific `U.ViewpointBundle` species.

### E.17.2:1 - Problem frame  *(informative)*

Engineering teams almost always talk about systems and their models through a **small set of recurring “views”**:
* *What capabilities and behaviours does the system enact?* — function‑oriented, transformation‑oriented talk.
* *What method descriptions, procedure structures, and control-logic descriptions does it realize?* — procedure-, method-, and state-oriented talk.
* *Which systems or acting holons are assigned which work-facing roles, responsibilities, or allocation expectations?* — role-assignment, organisational and socio-technical talk.
* *How is the system decomposed into modules and interfaces?* — physical and logical architecture talk.

In industry, these lenses show up under many names: *functional view, logical view, behavioural view, process view, structural and physical view, deployment view, responsibility view,* and so on. Modern standards and tools (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022, INCOSE SE Handbook, SysML v2 “views as queries”) all recognise that **viewpoints should be reusable structures**, not ad‑hoc labels.

In FPF, E.17.0 and E.17.1 give the **generic machinery**:
* `U.Viewpoint` as a viewpoint specification (stakes, concerns, and allowed Description kinds and specification-use gates),
* `U.View` as an episteme‑level view (epistema under a viewpoint),
* `U.ViewpointBundle` / `ViewFamilyId` as reusable collections of viewpoints.

`E.18` already uses a **canonical engineering viewpoint-family map** with names like “Functional”, “Procedural”, “allocation-responsibility or device-structure”, “Module-Interface”. Without a formal bundle tying these together, those names drift and the mapping between `E.18`, MVPK, EntityOfConcern, Description-episteme boundary, and specification use becomes fragile.

TEVB addresses this by defining a **single, explicit engineering bundle** with a fixed `ViewFamilyId` and a small set of canonical engineering viewpoints over `U.Holon`.

### E.17.2:2 - Problem  *(informative)*

Without TEVB, several failure modes recur:
1. **Inconsistent “functional”, “structural”, and “behavioural” vocabularies.** Different teams define “functional view” or “process view” differently, even within one organisation; `E.18:5.12` then has to guess how to map transformation-flow structures onto whichever interpretation is currently in play.
2. **Architecture frameworks leak into the kernel.** 4+1‑style and similar architectural frameworks get hard‑coded as if they were universal; FPF loses its holonic neutrality and becomes biased to a particular school.
3. **Viewpoints conflated with publication faces and publication forms and files.** “Functional view” is used both for the underlying viewpoint and for a concrete document or dashboard; MVPK faces and publication forms, `E.18` transformation-flow families, and EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme and specification-use distinctions become entangled.
4. **Role leakage into EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary and specification-use discipline.** Engineering views that are about holders, role assignments, responsibilities, or device allocation are written directly in terms of `U.Role`, blurring the boundary between work-facing role patterns (`A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.15`) and description or specification-use lanes, and breaking A.7 and E.10.D2.
5. **Poor reuse across systems.** Even when organisations want to reuse the same engineering views across products, plants, or models, there is no canonical bundle to import; each programme recreates “its own” functional and structural views.

TEVB makes engineering viewpoint families **first‑class reusable bundles** and pins them to an explicit `EntityOfConcernClass` (engineering holons) so that `E.18`, MVPK and discipline-packs can align on the same vocabulary.

### E.17.2:3 - Forces  *(informative)*

| Force                                       | Tension                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs domain idioms**           | We need engineering viewpoints that work for *any* holon (hardware, software, or socio-technical), yet remain recognisable to practitioners steeped in domain-specific frameworks. |
| **Parsimony vs expressiveness**             | A small, stable **NQD-front** set of engineering view families (Function, Behaviour and Process, Work-Role Holder, Module-Interface) vs the temptation to proliferate specialised views for every stakeholder group or quality attribute. |
| **Neutral core vs architecture frameworks** | FPF core must stay neutral and not encode a specific framework (4+1, DoDAF, etc.), while still being compatible with them.                                                    |
| **Consistency vs organisational autonomy**  | Central TEVB definitions must be stable, yet individual organisations need room to refine concerns and episteme kinds within the bundle.                                      |
| **EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary plus specification-use clarity vs convenient shortcuts**   | Viewpoints must not re-introduce `Role` as a coordinate in EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary or specification-use discipline, nor blur Description-episteme and specification-use distinctions with publication face, form, or carrier distinctions, even though practitioners informally mix these.             |

TEVB resolves these by fixing a **minimal engineering bundle** and leaving customisation to **species patterns and ViewpointBundleLibrary entries** that refine concerns and allowed episteme kinds without changing the core families.

### E.17.2:4 - Solution — TEVB as a core `U.ViewpointBundle` for holons  *(normative)*

#### E.17.2:4.1 - TEVB bundle identity

TEVB is the **core engineering viewpoint bundle** over holons.

* **Bundle object.** There exists a canonical `U.ViewpointBundle` instance:

  ```
  TEVB.EngBundle : U.ViewpointBundle
  ```

* **ViewFamilyId.**

  ```
  TEVB.EngBundle.viewFamilyId = VF.TEVB.ENG
  ```

  `VF.TEVB.ENG` is reserved for **“Typical Engineering Viewpoints (Engineering)”** in the FPF core ViewpointBundleLibrary.

* **EntityOfConcernClassSpec (holon scope).**

  TEVB is parameterised by

  ```
  TEVB.EngBundle.EntityOfConcernClassSpec =
    { h : U.Holon | holonKind(h) ∈ {U.System, U.Episteme} }
  ```

  That is, TEVB applies to holons that are either `U.System` or `U.Episteme`. Other holon kinds may be added by species patterns but must be justified and documented; the default conformance rule set assumes systems and epistemes.

* **Library placement.**

  TEVB is registered in the core viewpoint library:

  ```
  TEVB.Library : U.ViewpointBundleLibrary
  TEVB.Library.libraryId = FPF.Core.Viewpoints
  TEVB.Library.bundles ⊇ { TEVB.EngBundle }
  ```

  Additional organisational libraries may import and specialise TEVB, but must not redefine `VF.TEVB.ENG` with incompatible semantics.

* **Viewpoint set.**

  TEVB defines a **finite set of canonical engineering viewpoints**:

  ```
  TEVB.EngBundle.viewpoints =
    { VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.AllocationResponsibility, VP.ModuleInterface }
  ```

The selection `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.AllocationResponsibility, VP.ModuleInterface}` is the current **NQD-frontier** for engineering holon viewpoints in Part G: it realises a Function-Behaviour-Structure-plus-responsibility (`F-B-S+R`) cut that is non-dominated against candidate families including explicit information or data, assurance or safety, and mission or context viewpoints under the N, U, C, and D characteristics (C.18, G.0). Part G records the SoTA candidate set and rejected alternatives; TEVB only fixes the **core four** where each `VP.* : U.Viewpoint` is defined below. These four are the **only** viewpoints in the core TEVB bundle.

  > **Note.** Other ViewFamilyId values used in the `E.18` transformation-flow viewpoint-family map (for example, assurance-oriented, interoperability-oriented, information-oriented or data-oriented, operational-oriented or deployment-oriented, and mission-oriented or context-oriented labels) remain **lexical families only** for transformation-flow species (E.18:5.12). They do not add viewpoints to TEVB; they are orthogonal to TEVB's `viewpoints` set.

#### E.17.2:4.2 - TEVB engineering viewpoints

Each TEVB viewpoint is a `U.Viewpoint` with:
* `viewpointId : ViewpointId` (concrete identifier, e.g., `VP.Functional`);
* `EntityOfConcernClassSpec` **inherited from the bundle** (`U.Holon` with `System`/`Episteme` kinds);
* `StakeholderFamilies : FinSet(StakeholderFamilyId)` — audience or stakeholder families that are primary readers or concern holders for the viewpoint. These are viewpoint-context values, not work-facing role-assignment values or allocation-responsibility root kinds.
* `Concerns : FinSet(ConcernId)` — engineering concerns this viewpoint foregrounds;
* `AllowedEpistemeKinds : FinSet(U.EpistemeKindRef)` — Description-episteme and specification-use kinds admissible under this viewpoint (all obeying EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary, specification use, and C.2.1 slot disciplines);
* `ConformanceRules : FinSet(RuleId)` — references to checklist items in conformance packs (CV, GF, and engineering checklists).

The subsections below fix the **normative intent and minimal field sets** for each TEVB viewpoint. Species patterns and discipline‑packs may refine `Concerns`, `AllowedEpistemeKinds` and `ConformanceRules`, but must preserve the intent.

##### E.17.2:4.2.1 - `VP.Functional` - functional behavior and capability viewpoint

**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of what it is required or able to do: capabilities, functional behaviors, and required transformations or effects. If responsibility for those requirements is current, express that responsibility through `VP.AllocationResponsibility` and the work-facing role-assignment patterns rather than making responsibility a functional-viewpoint coordinate. A functional behavior is grounded as `U.Transformation` when the claim is one bounded required change or effect, and as `TransformationFlowStructure` when the behavior is a compound structure of transformations. This viewpoint is not a module view and does not mint `U.Function`.

* **viewpointId.**

  ```
  VP.Functional : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId
  ```

* **EntityOfConcernClassSpec.**
  Same as the bundle: `U.Holon` with `System`/`Episteme` kinds.

* **StakeholderFamilies (typical examples).**
  Actual `StakeholderFamilies : FinSet(StakeholderFamilyId)` values are local audience or stakeholder-family refs; labels below are informal and do not create role assignments.
  * System engineering leads and architects (e.g. SysEng-lead enactors).
  * Product owners / capability owners.
  * Reliability / performance engineers when reading capability envelopes.

* **Concerns (typical).**
  * Functional behavior: required `U.Transformation` or `TransformationFlowStructure` under conditions.
  * Capabilities and envelopes provided by the holon (`CapabilityConcerns`).
  * Functioning status: required, possible, intended, observed, degraded, or blocked behavior.
  * Input-and-output signatures or functional-port signatures where accepted or produced states, flows, media, signals, information, work products, or formal objects matter.
  * Compositional semantics of functional behavior in transformation-flow structures.

* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**
  `VP.Functional` admits Description epistemes and specification-use Description epistemes whose **EntityOfConcernSlot** remains the holon and whose viewpoint content foregrounds the holon's functional behavior, capability, `FunctionalElement@Context`, or transformation-flow relation, e.g.:
  * `SystemFunctionalDescription`, `SystemFunctionalSpec` describing system-level capabilities, functional behavior, and interconnection.
  * `FunctionalElementDescription`, `FunctionalElementSpec` when a `FunctionalElement@Context` locus with behavior, bearer, ports, capability, and allocation is current.
  * `TransformationBehaviorDescription`, `TransformationBehaviorSpec` when the behavior is a bounded `U.Transformation` or selected `TransformationFlowStructure`.
  * `ServiceCapabilityDescription`, `ServiceCapabilitySpec` when the functional viewpoint foregrounds service-facing capability, promise content, delivery work, access point, delivery system, or API/publication description; use current `U.RoleAssignment` only if a work-facing role value is actually assigned for service delivery or service operation.

  All such epistemes satisfy these admissibility checks:
  * obey EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary plus specification-use discipline: `...Description` names a Description episteme about the holon and `...Spec` names specification-use of that Description episteme for declared functional behavior, capability, method, mechanism, port, or promise content;
  * make their `DescriptionContext = <EntityOfConcernRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef>` explicit, with `ViewpointRef = VP.Functional`;
  * use `A.3.4 FunctioningRef?`, `TransformerRef?`, `InputConditionOrPortRefs?`, and `OutputConditionOrPortRefs?` when the functional-view claim depends on bounded transformation, bearer, input and output boundary, or flow location.

* **ConformanceRules (examples).**
  * Functional behavior is grounded as `U.Transformation` or `TransformationFlowStructure` before function wording carries a claim.
  * `FunctionalElement@Context` remains a functional-view locus, not a module and not `U.Function`.
  * Functional ports and signatures are separated from module interfaces unless an A.6.M module-interface claim is current.
  * When functional views participate in retargeting patterns, they satisfy the relevant A.6.4 retargeting constraints; concrete consumer patterns such as E.18 may impose additional rules.

* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.Functional` corresponds to functional views in ISO-aligned architecture descriptions, domain reference architectures, FBS-style design ontologies, SysML and SysML v2 capability and logical architecture models, and logical view slices in 4+1-style frameworks once recast into holon, capability, functional-behavior, and transformation terms.

##### E.17.2:4.2.2 - `VP.Procedural` — process & control viewpoint

**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of **how behaviours are sequenced and controlled**: method-description structures, state machines, operational procedures, and control logic.

* **viewpointId.**

  ```
  VP.Procedural : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId
  ```

* **EntityOfConcernClassSpec.**

  Same as the bundle.

* **StakeholderFamilies (typical).**
  * Operations and run‑time owners (`OperationsEnactorFamily`).
  * Control engineers and automation specialists (`ControlEngineerEnactorFamily`).
  * Safety engineers concerned with procedural correctness (`SafetyEngineerEnactorFamily`).

* **Concerns (typical).**
  * Control flow and ordering of actions (`OrderConcerns`).
  * State‑machine behaviour and lifecycle (`StateLifecycleConcerns`).
  * Concurrency, synchronisation, and error handling (`ConcurrencyConcerns`).
  * Operational modes and transitions (startup, shutdown, degraded modes) (`OperationalModeConcerns`).

* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**
  `VP.Procedural` admits Description epistemes and specification-use Description epistemes where the **EntityOfConcernSlot** remains the holon and the viewpoint content foregrounds the holon's Method, procedure, control behaviour, or work-plan content, e.g.:
  * `MethodDescription`, `MethodSpec` for operational procedures (A.3.1–A.3.2).
  * `ControlLogicDescription`, `ControlLogicSpec` (IEC 61131‑3 style step diagrams and statecharts).
  * `WorkflowDescription`, `WorkflowSpec` (business processes, orchestration logic).

  These epistemes:
  * respect the **order discipline** (Γ_method, Γ_ctx) and A.15 (Role–Method–Work alignment);
  * carry E.10.D2-conformant DescriptionContext with `ViewpointRef = VP.Procedural`.

* **ConformanceRules (examples).**
  * Preconditions and postconditions at step boundaries are explicit and type-checked. Use `A.3.1` for the method as semantic way of doing, `A.3.2` for the method description, and `Gamma_method` only as notation over the recovered method claim.
  * No embedding of Work or calendars inside procedural descriptions (A.7 and E.10.D2).
  * Failure modes and recovery actions are declared and traceable to safety analyses (F.15 harnesses where relevant).

* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.Procedural` captures the dynamic and process dimension found in SoTA architecture and MBSE practice: process views in 4+1, operational and behavioural views in defence and enterprise frameworks, behaviour diagrams in SysML (activity, sequence, state, interaction), and procedure-oriented and control-logic-oriented models in industrial standards. TEVB abstracts this into a notation‑agnostic “behaviour over time” viewpoint for holons.

##### E.17.2:4.2.3 - `VP.AllocationResponsibility` - allocation, responsibility, and device-structure viewpoint

**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of which system or acting holon bears work-facing roles, responsibilities, role assignments, capability allocation, or device-side or system-side responsibility for functional behavior. The viewpoint id `VP.AllocationResponsibility` is an engineering viewpoint id, not a new root kind. When a source-local device or transformer cue names the system that performs or sustains a transformation, recover it as `U.System` or candidate system with a work-facing role assignment such as `TransformerRole@Context`, coordinated with `A.3.4 TransformerRef?`.

* **viewpointId.**

  ```
  VP.AllocationResponsibility : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId
  ```

* **EntityOfConcernClassSpec.**

  Same as the bundle.

* **StakeholderFamilies (typical).**
  * Organisational designers and operations managers (`OrgDesignEnactorFamily`).
  * Safety and compliance officers concerned with separation of duties (`SegregationOfDutyEnactorFamily`).
  * Hardware and system engineers concerned with which devices or systems carry which functional behaviors (`DeviceEngineerEnactorFamily`).

* **Concerns (typical).**
  * Which systems or acting holons hold which work-facing roles under which contexts (`RoleAssignmentConcerns`).
  * Which systems or candidate systems fill `TransformerRef?` for transformations or functioning.
  * Allocation of capabilities to devices, systems, subsystems, organizations, scripts, instruments, or manufacturing cells (`CapabilityAllocationConcerns`).
  * Organisational constraints: segregation of duties, responsibilities, escalation relations (`GovernanceConcerns`).
  * Device-view readings of functional transformation-flow descriptions, with source-local device or transformer vocabulary treated as source cue rather than durable FPF kind.

* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**
  `VP.AllocationResponsibility` admits Description epistemes and specification-use Description epistemes where the **EntityOfConcernSlot** remains the holon and the viewpoint content foregrounds work-facing role values, role assignments, responsibility structure, holder or allocated-holon locus, transformer relation, or capability allocation associated with that holon, e.g.:
  * `RoleDescription`, `RoleSpec` for human, organization, system, or device roles.
  * `RoleAssignmentDescription` for mappings from holder, role value, bounded context, and current window under A.2.1 and A.15.
  * `TransformerRoleAssignmentDescription` for a holder, role value, bounded context, current window, and A.3.4 transformation connected through current `U.RoleAssignment`, not through compact holder-role shorthand.
  * `DeviceAllocationDescription` mapping functional behavior to physical, organizational, or software systems.

  As with other TEVB viewpoints, these are Description epistemes and specification-use cases with `DescriptionContext.ViewpointRef = VP.AllocationResponsibility`.

* **ConformanceRules (examples).**
  * Role vs method vs work vs capability separation is upheld through A.7 and A.15.
  * A role-assignment or responsibility claim uses `U.RoleAssignment` when role assignment, work, responsibility, or capability is current; it does not infer performed work.
  * Device-view reinterpretation from functional flows is expressed as `U.EpistemicRetargeting` with an explicit `KindBridge` witness when the `EntityOfConcernRef` changes.
  * No "role as behavior" conflation: roles and bearer loci stay separate from methods, work, and bounded transformations.

* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.AllocationResponsibility` aligns with allocation and responsibility and resource and organizational view clusters in MBSE frameworks, allocation views in UAF/NAF, role-responsibility matrices and RACI-style artefacts, and role-assignment/responsibility slices in usage and operational viewpoints.

##### E.17.2:4.2.4 - `VP.ModuleInterface` - module and interface viewpoint

**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of modules, interfaces, and structural composition: what parts exist, how they connect, and how interface specifications, substitutability, compatibility, and change policies are stated. This viewpoint is distinct from `VP.Functional`: a module may realize many functional elements, many modules may realize one functional element, a functional element may be abstract before allocation, and a module may have no current functional behavior in the functional view.

* **viewpointId.**

  ```
  VP.ModuleInterface : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId
  ```

* **EntityOfConcernClassSpec.**
  Same as the bundle.

* **StakeholderFamilies (typical).**
  * Hardware and software architects responsible for structure (`StructureArchitectEnactorFamily`).
  * Integration and test engineers (`IntegrationEngineerEnactorFamily`).
  * Lifecycle and maintenance planners looking at replaceable units (`MaintenancePlannerEnactorFamily`).

* **Concerns (typical).**
  * Module decomposition and containment (mereology) (`ModuleMereologyConcerns`).
  * Interface specifications: protocols, schemas, physical connectors, APIs, version and change policies, conformance expectations (`InterfaceConcerns`).
  * Dependency structures and allowed couplings (`DependencyConcerns`).
  * Replaceability and variation points (`VariabilityConcerns`).
  * Correspondence or allocation between modules and functional elements without identity by default.

* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**
  `VP.ModuleInterface` admits Description epistemes and specification-use Description epistemes where the **EntityOfConcernSlot** remains the holon and the viewpoint content foregrounds the holon's structural architecture, modules, interfaces, and connector arrangements, e.g.:
  * `SystemStructureDescription`, `SystemStructureSpec` for module and connector descriptions.
  * `ModuleInterfaceDescription`, `ModuleInterfaceSpec` for signature, interface specifications, physical interface definitions, and conformance expectations.
  * `ModuleFunctionalAllocationDescription` when module-interface structure is being related to `FunctionalElement@Context` or `FunctionalStructureView@Context` through correspondence or allocation.

  These epistemes describe holon structure, module-interface arrangement, ports and connectors, or structural architecture as viewpoint content about the holon rather than replacing the holon as the `EntityOfConcern`. Functional-to-module reinterpretations between `VP.Functional` and `VP.ModuleInterface` use declared correspondence or allocation or `U.EpistemicRetargeting` + `KindBridge` when the `EntityOfConcernRef` changes.

* **ConformanceRules (examples).**
  * Interfaces are typed and explicitly bound to standards or signature declarations where applicable (`A.6.0`, `A.6.M`, A.6.5).
  * Functional ports are not treated as module interfaces unless the module-interface or substitutability claim is current.
  * No inlining of methods, work, or functional behavior into module structure. Use `A.3.4` for transformation claims, `A.6.F` for function-allocation claims, and `A.15` for work and role-method-work alignment claims.
  * Reinterpretations from functional views into structure respect the applicable `U.EpistemicRetargeting`/Bridge constraints.

* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.ModuleInterface` matches structural, implementation, construction, deployment, and interface-focused families in architecture descriptions, IoT and space reference architectures, UAF, NAF, RASDS, SysML-based MBSE, and 4+1 development and physical views, while keeping functional behavior and module-interface claims distinct.

### E.17.2:5 - Archetypal grounding  *(informative)*

A minimal TEVB instantiation looks as follows:

```
TEVB.EngBundle :
  U.ViewpointBundle {
    viewFamilyId   = VF.TEVB.ENG
    EntityOfConcernClassSpec   = { h : U.Holon | HolonKind(h) ∈ {System, Episteme} }
    viewpoints     = { VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.AllocationResponsibility, VP.ModuleInterface }
    LibraryRef     = FPF.Core.Viewpoints
  }
```

Each `VP.*` viewpoint is a `U.Viewpoint` as in E.17.0, with:

* `viewpointId ∈ {VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.AllocationResponsibility, VP.ModuleInterface}`,
* `EntityOfConcernClassSpec` inherited from `TEVB.EngBundle`,
* `StakeholderFamilies`, `Concerns`, `AllowedEpistemeKinds`, `ConformanceRules` aligned with the subsections above.

**Engineering holon (example).**

Let `Plant_X : U.System` be a production plant, and `ControlStack_X : U.Episteme` be its control and optimisation stack as a holon.

* Under `VP.Functional`, `Plant_X` is viewed as a bundle of capabilities, functional behaviors, and required transformations: material, energy, and product flows, optimisation functions, safety envelopes.
* Under `VP.Procedural`, `Plant_X` is viewed as sets of procedures and control sequences: startup and shutdown, normal operation, emergency handling.
* Under `VP.AllocationResponsibility`, `Plant_X` is viewed as role-assignment and responsibility structures: human operators, controllers, and subsystems assigned work-facing roles in SOPs and safety cases.
* Under `VP.ModuleInterface`, `Plant_X` is viewed as modules and interfaces: equipment units, pipelines, control modules, buses, and their interfaces and specifications.

Each of these is a **family of Description epistemes and specification-use cases** with `DescriptionContext = ⟨EntityOfConcernRef(Plant_X or ControlStack_X), BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef=VP.*⟩` and TEVB ensures that `E.18` and MVPK can rely on this common structure.

### E.17.2:5.1 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias | How E.17.2 prevents it |
| --- | --- |
| Viewpoint-as-publication-face bias | `VP.*` ids are engineering viewpoint ids, not publication faces, publication forms, files, cards, or carriers. |
| Architecture-framework import bias | TEVB is an engineering viewpoint bundle over holons; architecture-specific viewpoint bundles remain separate species that may import TEVB. |
| Role-coordinate leakage | `VP.AllocationResponsibility` names a viewpoint, not a new `U.Role`, `U.RoleAssignment`, or allocation-responsibility root kind inside Description episteme signatures. |
| Viewpoint proliferation bias | Assurance, information, mission, deployment, and business labels remain separate bundle species or lexical family labels unless a new `U.ViewpointBundle` species is explicitly introduced. |
| EntityOfConcern drift | TEVB-aligned descriptions keep the selected holon as `EntityOfConcernRef` unless a governed retargeting pattern changes it. |

### E.17.2:6 - Conformance checklist  *(normative)*

**CC‑TEVB‑1 (Bundle identity).**
Any artefact claiming to be “TEVB engineering viewpoints” must:

* refer to `viewFamilyId = VF.TEVB.ENG`,
* have `EntityOfConcernClassSpec = {h : U.Holon | HolonKind(h) ∈ {System, Episteme}}`,
* enumerate `viewpoints = {VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.AllocationResponsibility, VP.ModuleInterface}` and no others.

**CC‑TEVB‑2 (Viewpoint definition).**
Each `VP.*` viewpoint must be a well‑formed `U.Viewpoint` per E.17.0:

* `viewpointId` equal to one of the four engineering IDs,
* `EntityOfConcernClassSpec` equal to the bundle’s,
* `StakeholderFamilies`, `Concerns`, `AllowedEpistemeKinds`, `ConformanceRules` explicitly declared.

**CC‑TEVB‑3 (DescriptionContext completeness).**
Every Description episteme or specification-use case participating in a TEVB‑managed multi‑view family for a holon must have a `DescriptionContext = ⟨EntityOfConcernRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` with:

* `EntityOfConcernRef` referencing a `U.System` or `U.Episteme`,
* `ViewpointRef ∈ {VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.AllocationResponsibility, VP.ModuleInterface}`,
* `BoundedContextRef` pointing to the engineering context (E.10.D1).

Capability, Method, procedure terms, control-logic terms, role-structure, structural-architecture, module, interface, and allocation terms in those descriptions are viewpoint concern and content unless the text explicitly declares an A.6.4 retargeting, KindBridge, and species-extension rule that changes `EntityOfConcernRef`.

**CC‑TEVB‑4 (Separation from PublicationVPs).**
`VP.*` identifiers from TEVB are engineering-viewpoint ids. They do not serve as MVPK publication-side viewpoint ids. Publication-side viewpoints are governed in MVPK and may **correspond** to TEVB engineering viewpoints through `CorrespondenceModel`, but they are separate symbols.

**CC‑TEVB‑5 (No Role coordinate in EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary or specification use).**
TEVB-aligned descriptions and specification-use cases may reference stakeholder or audience families in `StakeholderFamilies`, and may use `VP.AllocationResponsibility` as the viewpoint id, but they must not add `Role`, `RoleAssignment`, or a `AllocationResponsibility` value as a characteristic in Description episteme or specification-use case signatures beyond what A.7, C.2.1, and E.10.D2 already provide. Work-facing role and holder claims stay in `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.15`, and Part F; TEVB just selects concerns.

**CC‑TEVB‑6 (Alignment with consumer viewpoint maps).**
When a pattern defines engineering viewpoint families named “Functional”, “Procedural”, “Allocation‑Responsibility (Device‑Structure)”, or “Module‑Interface” over the same `EntityOfConcernClass` and claims TEVB alignment (for example, the `E.18:5.12` transformation-flow viewpoint-family map), it must bind them to TEVB viewpoints as follows:

* “Functional” → `VP.Functional`,
* “Procedural” → `VP.Procedural`,
* “Allocation‑Responsibility (Device‑Structure)” → `VP.AllocationResponsibility`,
* “Module‑Interface” → `VP.ModuleInterface`.

Any deviation must be explicitly documented as a species‑level extension and must not reuse `VF.TEVB.ENG`.

### E.17.2:6.1 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functional view means the diagram | A functional diagram, card, or dashboard is treated as `VP.Functional` itself. | Keep `VP.Functional` as the viewpoint; model the diagram or card through Description, view, publication face, or publication form machinery. |
| Architecture framework becomes TEVB | A 4+1, UAF, NAF, SysML, or local framework is imported as the FPF viewpoint bundle. | Map it to TEVB or to a separate architecture-specific `U.ViewpointBundle` species. |
| Responsibility view becomes role assignment | A responsibility-oriented view adds `U.Role` or `U.RoleAssignment` as a Description-episteme coordinate. | Keep responsibility as viewpoint content; use `A.2`, `A.2.1`, and `A.15` when a work-facing role assignment is actually claimed. |
| Extra viewpoint by label | Information, assurance, mission, or deployment labels are added directly to `TEVB.EngBundle.viewpoints`. | Introduce a separate bundle species or keep the label as a transformation-flow family label where appropriate. |

### E.17.2:6.2 - Consequences

Positive consequences:

- Engineering descriptions can reuse one compact viewpoint bundle across systems, epistemes, and architecture-description bundles.
- Functional, procedural, allocation-responsibility, and module-interface views stay comparable without importing one architecture framework as FPF law.
- Publication faces, architecture-specific views, role assignments, methods, work, and module-interface claims keep their direct owners.

Costs:

- Teams must declare when a local framework maps to TEVB and when it needs a separate viewpoint-bundle species.
- TEVB intentionally does not absorb every useful engineering or stakeholder viewpoint; specialized bundles remain necessary.

### E.17.2:7 - Rationale  *(informative)*

#### E.17.2:7.1 - NQD‑grounded choice of the core four

Part G's NQD discipline treats candidate viewpoint families as points in an N, U, C, and D quality space (Use-Value, Constraint-Fit, Novelty, Diversity_P). Applied to a SoTA-harvested candidate set of engineering viewpoints (Functional, Behavioural, Procedural, Structural-Module, Allocation-Responsibility, Information-Data, Assurance-Safety, Mission-Context, Deployment-Operational, Business-Usage), this yields a small Pareto frontier for *engineering holon* viewpoints. On that frontier, the `F-B-S+R` cut implemented by `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.AllocationResponsibility, VP.ModuleInterface}` is the minimal set that:
* spans the Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology used in contemporary design theory while adding an explicit allocation and responsibility concern;
* aligns with the “functional”, “process”, “structural”, and “deployment” clusters recurrent in standards and architecture frameworks;
* stays neutral with respect to domain‑specific qualities (`‑ilities`) and business and mission framing, which are captured in separate Q‑Bundles and governance-oriented viewpoint bundles rather than in TEVB itself.

Other candidates (e.g. dedicated information, assurance, or mission viewpoints) remain important but either duplicate concerns already captured by TEVB (when specialised to engineering holons) or are better modelled as orthogonal quality bundles (C.25) or non-engineering viewpoint bundles (business and governance viewpoint bundles). TEVB therefore pins only the core four and leaves the rest to specialised families.

### E.17.2:7.2 - SoTA-Echoing - Alignment with post-2015 engineering practice

* Modern architecture standards built on ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 describe viewpoint libraries in which functional, behavioural and process, structural and deployment, and business and usage concerns are the dominant clusters; sector RAs such as IoT RA 30141 and space‑domain RAs provide explicit functional and construction and implementation viewpoints alongside business and usage and trustworthiness viewpoints. TEVB reuses the functional and construction and structural clusters as `VP.Functional` and `VP.ModuleInterface`, while treating business and trustworthiness as separate bundles.
* Model-based systems engineering practice (INCOSE MBSE guidance, SysML v2 “views-as-queries”, UAF/NAF view grids) converges on a small set of core diagram families: structure, behaviour, allocation and responsibility, requirements and mission. TEVB’s `VP.Procedural` and `VP.AllocationResponsibility` correspond to the behaviour and allocation-and-responsibility concerns, respectively, and are designed to be notation-neutral over SysML-, UAF-, UML-, and Capella-style models.
* The FBS family of design ontologies (Function–Behaviour–Structure and extensions) provides a widely used conceptual source for separating what a system is for, what it does over time, and what it consists of. TEVB’s four viewpoints intentionally implement a Function-Behaviour-Structure-plus-responsibility split at the holon level: `VP.Functional` ≈ Function, `VP.Procedural` ≈ Behaviour, `VP.ModuleInterface` ≈ Structure, with `VP.AllocationResponsibility` capturing the explicit mapping from functions and behaviours to role-assignment and responsibility structures.
* Within FPF itself, `E.18` transformation-flow “viewpoint families” (Functional, Procedural, Allocation-Responsibility or Device-Structure, Module-Interface, plus assurance, interoperability, data, operational, and mission labels) are harmonised by letting the **core four** be TEVB viewpoints and treating the rest as lexical or bundle-level overlays, not as new kernel viewpoints.

#### E.17.2:7.3 - Why TEVB stays small

TEVB is deliberately *not* a complete architecture framework. It gives FPF a stable, holon‑centred engineering bundle that:
* is small enough to keep in working memory and to govern via EpistemeSlotRelation discipline;
* is expressive enough to represent mappings from SoTA architecture frameworks (4+1, domain‑specific RAs, UAF/NAF grids, SysML‑based MBSE method kits);
* can be safely combined with additional `U.ViewpointBundle` species (safety and assurance packs, business and mission packs, and information and data packs) without mutating the core four;
* sits conceptually **below** architecture‑specific viewpoint libraries, which are introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species layering TEVB with mission, quality, and business viewpoints instead of redefining TEVB.

As SoTA evolves, new bundles can be added or TEVB can gain a new edition with a revised NQD‑frontier, but the TEVB‑A edition fixed here remains the archetypal engineering bundle for holons.

### E.17.2:8 - Relations  *(informative)*

* **Builds on.** E.17.0 (`U.MultiViewDescribing`), E.17.1 (`U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`), A.7 and E.10.D2 (EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary plus specification use), C.2.1 (EpistemeSlotRelation), A.6.2-A.6.4 (episteme morphisms).
* **Constrains.** E.18:5.12 (transformation-flow viewpoint-family map), engineering description and specification-use patterns, MVPK engineering publication guidance.
* **Coordinates with.** MVPK publication face, publication form, publication unit, and publication carrier discipline; `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.15`, and Part F role-description and role-name patterns; F.18 (naming discipline for ViewFamilyId, ViewpointId, EngineeringVPId, and publication-side viewpoint ids).
* **Non‑goals.** TEVB does not prescribe modelling notations (SysML, BPMN, IEC 61131‑3, etc.), storage formats, or tool APIs. It only fixes the **conceptual viewpoint bundle** that such tools must respect when claiming FPF alignment.
