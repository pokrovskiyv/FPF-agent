## E.14 - Human‑Centric Working‑Model
> **Status:** Stable
> **Type:** Pattern

### E.14:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when FPF text needs to stay readable as one human working model while heavier mapping, logical, constructive, or empirical assurance remains recoverable underneath it.

**What goes wrong if missed.** The working text either drifts into local jargon and slash labels or calcifies into proof machinery that practitioners cannot use in ordinary design, review, or management work.

**What this buys.** A working reader sees one small model first, while assurance readers can still recover mapping, logical, constructive, and empirical grounding without forcing that machinery back into the Working-Model vocabulary.

### E.14:1 - Intent

Establish a **single, human‑centric Working‑Model** that practitioners can read, discuss, and evolve **without exposure to formal machinery**.
Each statement **declares an author's assurance posture** (`validationMode`) and, when assurance is sought, attaches **appropriate grounding** through one or more assurance shoulders — **Mapping**, **Logical**, **Constructive** — and may additionally attach **Empirical Validation** as defined by the Trust & Assurance calculus. The posture and its supports justify or challenge the published claim; they create neither the governed value nor a world-side relation occurrence. Empirical Validation can accompany any posture and is **required** when the posture is *postulate*. Assurance shoulders sit **beneath** the Working-Model and **never define its vocabulary**.

Put bluntly: *one model people work in; three assurance shoulders — plus empirical checks when the world is the judge.*

### E.14:2 - Problem Frame

Teams need **one shared Working-Model** to make decisions at speed. Historically this shared model either:

* **drifts into jargon** - different terms for one shared working-model value, slash-labels, partial overlaps; or
* **calcifies into machinery** - too formal for day-to-day design and review.

Both failure modes create friction between two audiences:
(1) **working users** (engineers, programme managers, policy owners) who need a **small, stable Working-Model text**, and
(2) **assurance authors** (ontologists, methodologists, auditors) who need **proofs that the Working-Model text is sound**.

E.14 resolves the impasse by **separating concerns**:

* A **Working-Model layer**: curated kinds and relations expressed in plain terms, governed by simple human rules.
* An **Assurance stack** beneath it - **Mapping**, **Logical**, **Constructive** - that carries the heavy arguments and accounts (concept alignment, direct relation semantics, construction-trace epistemes) and **never leaks back** into the Working-Model narrative.

This pattern dovetails with the framework's unification stance (**small Working-Model text, rigorous foundations**) and with the constructional-mereology discipline that `sum`, `set`, and `slice` provide inspectable accounts of independently grounded assembly, collection, and aspect facts. Those forms do not create a relation occurrence or decide whole identity. The Kernel stays minimal and meta-only.

### E.14:2.1 - Problem

A reader may need to decide, design, review, or coordinate with FPF terms before they are ready to inspect mapping tables, constructive traces, evidence records, or proof arguments. If the working text exposes all of that machinery first, the model becomes unusable; if it hides the machinery completely, the model becomes arbitrary. E.14 keeps one human-facing Working-Model visible while making the assurance shoulders recoverable beneath it.

### E.14:3 - Forces

1. **Cognitive economy vs. semantic precision.**
   Managers and engineers must navigate with a handful of names and relations; assurance authors must still check that each name has one intended governed value, each relation claim has the required direct basis, and identity conditions are explicit.

2. **Speed of change vs. guarantees.**
   The Working‑Model must accommodate rapid iteration; the Assurance stack must **lag just enough** to check, without blocking practical progress.

3. **Parsimony vs. expressivity.**
   The Working‑Model should **not proliferate relation types or ad‑hoc categories**; fine‑grained distinctions live in the Assurance layers and are shown **only when they materially change a decision**.

4. **Downward grounding vs. upward contamination.**
   Grounding must always flow **down** (Working‑Model → Mapping → Logical → Constructive). No dependence **up** is allowed: proofs and traces never dictate wording or layout in the Working‑Model.

5. **Trans‑disciplinary unification vs. local dialects.**
   The Working‑Model must reconcile different disciplines’ habits **without erasing them**; Mapping captures dialects, while the Working‑Model exposes a **single usable choice**.

6. **Auditability vs. readability.**
   Every Working‑Model statement must be **auditable on request**, yet day‑to‑day views **hide the scaffolding** unless summoned.

### E.14:4 - Solution

#### E.14:4.1 - Human-Centric principles

##### E.14:4.1.1 - Recognition text and assurance text
Human-facing patterns also need EntityOfConcern stability across the two reading-order text blocks. The working reader should not meet one object in the recognition text and a different ontological kind in the assurance text. If the pattern distinguishes an EntityOfConcern, the interpretive or operational move applied to that object, and the wider review or work process around it, those distinctions should be made explicit rather than hidden behind stylistic noun-swapping.

Working-Model-first drafting therefore also means subject-domain-first drafting. If a pattern is meant to help with a real review, design, cultural, research, or operational problem, the recognition text should open from that problem-owning moment before internal taxonomy or package architecture. If a broader umbrella head and a narrower operative branch are both live, the pattern should state that stack plainly enough that a cold reader can tell what the umbrella names, what branch is current, what object is governed, what move is being carried, and what wider work remains outside.

Under `F.18` local-first naming, the canonical pair here is **recognition text** and **assurance text**.
The earlier provisional `...shell` wording is retired.
These names refer to two reading-order text blocks inside one pattern, not to new publication-face kinds or authority kinds.

For human-facing canonical patterns, Working-Model-first discipline should appear in a two-part reading order.
The **recognition text** is the working text that a cold practitioner, manager, or researcher should be able to understand first: what situation this pattern is for, what it buys, what it is not for, and what ordinary mistake it helps prevent.
The **assurance text** is the heavier text that carries declaration, object discipline, modeling lens, law, return conditions, and other assurance work.

The assurance text may justify, tighten, or audit the working text, but it must not silently replace or strengthen the recognition-text claim.
Where episteme-publication-heavy or transform-heavy patterns need a compact ontological account, the assurance text should expose three things explicitly:
- the ontic target or EntityOfConcern;
- the modeling substrate or mathematical lens when one is load-bearing;
- the publication face or working text by which the claim is presented.

This is a reading-order rule rather than a demand that every reader consume the assurance text first.
The point is to keep the human-facing Working-Model text primary while preserving a recoverable, auditable assurance text beneath it.
> **E.14‑P.1 – Working‑Model first, stance explicit.**  **
> Operate one **Working-Model** for all human-facing discussion. For **each** assertion, the author **SHALL declare** an assurance posture (`validationMode`) and choose the **appropriate assurance shoulder(s)**: **Mapping** (term-to-kind alignment through Lang-CHR or D-Projection), **Logical** (label-meaning rules, scope, and constraints), **Constructive** (a C.2.1 construction-trace episteme about independently grounded facts), and **Empirical Validation** (an evidence-use relation for the claim, with scope, timespan, provenance, and declared `U.BoundedContext`). None of these shoulders creates the governed value, relation occurrence, or identity it supports.

> **E.14‑P.2 – Downward‑only dependency.**
> Information **may** flow from the Working‑Model down into any Assurance layer; **no Assurance layer may impose vocabulary or shape back upward** into the Working‑Model.
>
> **E.14‑P.3 – Small working text, big proof.**
> The Working-Model exposes a **minimal set** of names (L-1/L-2 registers) and a compact family of relations used in everyday reasoning; the assurance text makes their meanings, direct basis, limits, and support inspectable below.

> **E.14‑P.4 – Human registers first.**
> Terms in the Working‑Model are deliberately curated for **human legibility** (register‑badged, synonym‑aware). Synonym capture and language variance belong to Mapping; **only the chosen canonical label appears in the Working-Model text**.

> **E.14‑P.5 – Justification modes are explicit.**
> Each Working‑Model relation **declares** `validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, inferential, postulate}`.
> _axiomatic_ means that the author relies on one linked Constructive account for this assertion; _inferential_ means that the author relies on a reasoned chain; _postulate_ means that the assertion remains a pragmatic claim requiring Empirical Validation. `validationMode` is an assurance posture, not a world-side relation kind, identity test, or timelessness guarantee. Empirical Validation may also accompany inferential or axiomatic assertions. Mapping, Logical, Constructive, and Empirical assurance remain separate from the claim's direct ontology and from the currentness of every record involved.

> **E.14‑P.6 – Parsimony in the working text.**
> No new Working‑Model relation types are introduced if the existing Logical label-meaning rules plus Constructive grounding suffice to capture the intended meaning.

> **E.14‑P.7 – Evidence is first-class claim grounding.**
> When *postulate* is chosen, authors **SHALL** attach an **evidence pointer** (Empirical Validation) appropriate to the claim and context, governed as an evidence-use relation within a declared `U.BoundedContext`.

> **E.14‑P.8 – Working-model-first is not explanation-thin.**
> Human-facing parsimony does **not** license under-explained pattern prose. When a pattern claims a Working‑Model benefit, it **SHALL** still provide enough problem framing, rationale, and worked slices that readers can tell what the model clarifies, what remains on the assurance shoulders, and when a heavier review path is required.

### E.14:5 - Layer Standard & Downward Flow (Working‑Model → Assurance)

This section defines **what each layer is for**, **what it guarantees**, and **how a single Working‑Model statement is carried down**.

#### E.14:5.1 - Working‑Model (what humans see)

**Purpose.** A small, curated graph of kinds and relations that a mixed team can read at a glance.

**Elements.**

* **Kinds** — one **chosen concept** per node (no slash‑labels).
* **Relations** — a short list intelligible to non‑specialists (e.g., *Component‑of*, *Member‑of*, *Aspect‑of*, plus a small number of cross‑disciplinary ties such as *Interface‑of* or *Constituent‑of*).
* **Language register badges** — labels shown in the Working-Model are L‑1 or L‑2; L‑3/L‑4 remain in Mapping as synonyms or symbols.

**Obligations.**

* Every Working‑Model edge and node is **grounded downward** (see below).
* The Working‑Model **does not display** constructor jargon, proof terminology, or evidence identifiers; those live in Assurance and are **available on demand**.

#### E.14:5.2 - Assurance-1: Mapping (from words to chosen governed values)

**Purpose.** Consolidate human labels from varied sources and **bind them to the chosen governed values** used on the Working-Model, including admitted U-kinds where kindhood is live.

**Guarantee.** For any Working-Model label, there exists a **stable alignment** to exactly one chosen governed value in the current scope; synonyms, abbreviations, locales, and registers are recorded here, **not** in the displayed Working-Model. Mapping primarily raises **Concept-Bridge Assurance (CBA)** by consolidating synonyms/registers and binding tokens/labels to the chosen governed value; calculus-level metrics live outside Part E.

**Deliverable.** A compact alignment table per scope that makes it obvious which **one label** the Working‑Model will show and which background source labels are recognized only as source wording.

*(Rationale: Working teams speak many dialects; the Working‑Model speaks one. Mapping is the interpreter.)*

#### E.14:5.3 - Assurance‑2: Logical (from Working‑Model relations to label semantics)

**Purpose.** Give each Working-Model relation **one precise intended meaning** and **its admissible use cases**, keeping the Working-Model vocabulary small.

**Guarantee.** A Working‑Model edge such as *Component‑of* or *Aspect‑of* **carries one intended reading** (transitivity/antisymmetry expectations, scope notes), sufficient for auditors to assess whether the **use is legitimate** in a given context.

**Deliverable.** A short set of label-meaning rules: “When an edge is labeled *Component-of* in the Working-Model text, it intends the direct structural reading whose exact participants, relation occurrence, construction rule, and identity conditions must be recovered before the assertion is accepted.” The Logical layer ties human labels to accepted meanings; it does not make the relation obtain. Calculus-level symbols are not used in E-patterns.

*(Rationale: logical label alignment protects the small Working-Model text from relation proliferation while keeping meanings crisp.)*

#### E.14:5.4 - Assurance-3: Constructive (from a structural claim to its inspectable construction account)

**Purpose.** Make the construction basis of a published structural claim inspectable without turning the assurance account into the relation or the whole.

**Guarantee.** One truthful construction trace names the exact whole, collection, or aspect; its participants; the direct relation occurrences that obtain; the applicable assembly, collection, or facet rule; and the direct identity or reidentification conditions. The same inputs under another assembly may form another whole, while a permitted constituent replacement may preserve the same whole. The trace decides neither case.

**Deliverable.** For a published structural assertion, link through `tv:groundedBy` to one current C.2.1 construction-trace episteme in the C.13 `sum`, `set`, or `slice` form and declare the author's `validationMode=axiomatic` posture. Creating, revising, publishing, or losing that trace changes the account or its availability, not the relation occurrence or whole identity. The trace edition, its warrants and evidence, and the temporal status of the described direct facts retain their own currentness.

*(Rationale: constructive assurance makes the facts and identity tests behind ordinary part-whole talk inspectable; it does not substitute an author narrative for those facts.)*

#### E.14:5.5 - Assurance‑4: Empirical Validation (from claims to observed world)

**Purpose.** Record when and where a Working-Model claim meets reality.
**Guarantee.** Every empirical binding names a **`U.BoundedContext`**, a **target claim/scope**, and a **timespan**; **staleness/refresh** are managed per context policy.
**Deliverable.** An evidence-use relation or provenance/evidence pointer anchored into the Evidence-Provenance chain; it names the target claim, scope, bounded context, timespan, and provenance anchors. Empirical Validation contributes **LA** (raises empirical **R** and constrains **G** to its validated envelope).

#### E.14:5.6 - The downward grounding for a single Working-Model statement

Consider a Working‑Model arrow **A –Component‑of→ B**:

1. **Mapping** shows that the words *A* and *B* are the chosen labels for their kinds; it records background source labels without making them displayed Working-Model names.
2. **Logical** confirms that **Component‑of** in the Working-Model text means the **structural reading** with its ordinary mereological expectations; if the Working-Model text used *Member‑of* instead, Logical would similarly certify the intended reading and its boundaries.
3. **Constructive** links the published assertion to one current C.2.1 trace episteme that reports the exact participants, direct relation occurrences, applicable construction rule, and identity or reidentification conditions in a `sum`, `set`, or `slice` form. The author declares `validationMode=axiomatic` as the assurance posture. The direct relation and identity tests remain decisive; the trace and mode create neither.
4. **Empirical Validation** records the **evidence pointer** and scope that make the claim auditable within its `U.BoundedContext` (required for *postulate*; optional reinforcement for other stances).

Together, these assurance shoulders and empirical evidence-use relation **ground the human arrow without leaking their machinery upward**. The Working‑Model remains simple; the Assurance stack carries the proof.

### E.14:6 - Archetypal Grounding *(System / Episteme)*

> **Tell–Show–Show.** The principle is stated once, then shown on a `U.System` case (structural) and on a `U.Episteme` case (knowledge‑bearing), in line with the authoring template.

#### E.14:6.1 - `U.System` — Working‑Model first, Constructive grounding available

* **Publication (Working‑Model).** Authors state structure using familiar relations (e.g., *Impeller* **ut\:ComponentOf** *Pump*; *Pump* **ut\:ComponentOf** *Skid*). Nothing else is required for readers to follow the design.
* **Assurance (downward grounding).** When higher assurance is sought, first recover the exact skid, parts, direct fastening, coupling, enclosure, terminal, flange, and seal occurrences, the applicable skid assembly rule, and the skid reidentification rule. Then link the published claim to one current C.2.1 `sum` trace that reports those facts and declare the assurance posture. The account remains below the Working-Model; order and time stay in their own relation families.
* **Canonization move.** Readers continue to see Working‑Model relations as the primary Working-Model text; the constructive story is *supporting*, not *defining*.

#### E.14:6.2 - `U.Episteme` - Working-Model first; Logical and Mapping preferred; Empirical evidence as appropriate

* **Publication (Working‑Model).** Authors connect meaning-bearing epistemes or publications using knowledge relations (e.g., **RepresentationOf**, **UsageOf**) in the same human‑oriented style.
* **Assurance (downward grounding).** Here assurance typically uses the **Logical** or **Mapping** shoulders (reasoned argument; type/lexical alignment). **Empirical Validation** is used where observation is the right currency: an episteme, observation, or work result is used in an evidence-use relation for a target claim with explicit scope, context, time, and provenance. Constructive grounding is optional and used only where a structural interpretation is genuinely intended.
* **Canonization move.** Again, Working‑Model text is the public form; assurance is attached deliberately and separately, without leaking method or time semantics into structure.

**6.3 - Pattern lesson (both cases)**
The **Working-Model layer remains the canonical publication face** for authors and assurance readers; **assurance layers** (Mapping, Logical, and Constructive) are **opt-in** and used purposefully, with grounding flowing **downwards** from the Working-Model to the appropriate shoulder. This presentation respects the authoring template's *Archetypal Grounding* requirement and keeps notational choices illustrative rather than defining.

### E.14:7 - Bias-Annotation *(what to watch for, and the counter-moves)*

| Bias (name)                       | Symptom in drafts                                                                           | Conceptual counter‑move                                                                                                                        | Where this is governed                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Formalism capture**             | Treating a constructive narrative as “the real thing,” with **ut:\*Of** reduced to a label. | Re‑assert Working‑Model primacy: publish in **ut:\*Of**; attach assurance **downwards** only when needed.                                      | E.8 template; Notational‑Independence guard‑rail.                    |
| **Canonical inversion**           | Demanding constructive grounding for epistemic links by default.                            | Keep the **progressive** stance: prefer Logical/Mapping assurance for knowledge claims; raise to Constructive only when structure is at issue. | Authoring template; Working‑Model pattern family.                    |
| **Layer leakage (order/time)**    | Encoding sequence or phase as part-whole to "strengthen" claims.                            | Keep **order** and **time** in their governing relation families; do not smuggle them into structure.                                                                   | Style/structure guidance in Part E; flavour separation in Γ-family.  |
| **Collection and composition swap** | Using **MemberOf** as if it implied **ComponentOf**, or treating a `set` narrative as the source of membership. | Keep direct collection identity and membership occurrences separate from integrated assembly; a C.13 account reports those facts and creates none of them. | Working-Model mereology guidance (Part B/C linkage). |
| **Notation lock‑in**              | Letting a diagram or syntax define meaning.                                                 | Apply **Notational Independence**: define semantics in prose (maths if needed); treat renderings as informative.                               | Notational‑Independence guard‑rail.                                  |
| **Backwards dependency**          | Letting an assurance publication or record redefine public terms.                                        | Preserve **unidirectional dependence**: Working-Model terms do not derive their meaning from assurance publications or records.                              | Part E guard‑rails (dependency discipline).                          |
| **Silent stance**                 | Publishing claims with no declared assurance stance.                                        | Declare the stance explicitly (e.g., working claim vs reasoned vs constructive).                                                               | Style/authoring discipline in Part E.                                |

> **Reading reminder.** Bias checks are *conceptual* reading aids; they never introduce notational or tooling mandates.

### E.14:8 - Conformance Checklist *(normative; author‑facing duties for thought and prose)*

| ID                                         | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                      | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑E14‑1 (Working‑Model primacy).**      | Authors **SHALL** publish claims in **Working‑Model** form (human‑oriented **ut:\*Of** relations or equivalent domain statements) as the canonical publication face for readers.          | Preserve human‑first canon and didactic clarity.              |
|**CC-E14-2 (Downward grounding).** | When assurance is attached, grounding **SHALL** flow **downwards** from the Working-Model to the appropriate assurance shoulder (**Mapping, Logical, Constructive, or Empirical**) and **SHALL NOT** impose vocabulary back onto the Working-Model. | Maintain relation-family separation and cognitive economy. |
| **CC‑E14‑3 (Stance declaration).**         | For any claim where assurance matters, the author **SHALL** declare `validationMode` (*postulate / inferential / axiomatic*).                                                    | Make assurance intent explicit and readable.                  |
| **CC-E14-4 (No order/time in structure).** | Authors **SHALL NOT** encode execution order, parallelism, or temporal coverage as part-whole; keep them adjacent in their own relation families.                                           | Prevent layer leakage and category errors.                    |
| **CC‑E14‑5 (Collection differs from composition).** | Authors **SHALL** keep exact membership occurrences and collection identity distinct from component relations and integrated assembly. A gathering description or `set` trace creates neither membership nor component status. | Preserve the direct relation and identity boundaries. |
| **CC‑E14‑6 (Notational independence).**    | Core meaning **MUST NOT** hinge on a specific diagram or syntax; any rendering present **SHALL** be marked informative.                                                          | Ensure longevity and cross‑discipline portability.            |
| **CC‑E14‑7 (Layer direction).**            | Authors **SHALL** avoid back-defining Working-Model terms by their assurance publications or records; dependence is one‑way (Working‑Model → Assurance).                                       | Preserve unidirectional dependence of layers.                 |
| **CC‑E14‑8 (Template compliance).**        | Sections **SHALL** follow the canonical pattern order; *Archetypal Grounding* is mandatory for architectural patterns.                                                                            | Keep patterns comparable and auditable by reading.            |
| **CC‑E14‑9 (Progressive formality).**      | Authors **SHOULD** escalate assurance deliberately (from working claim to reasoned to constructive), and use **Empirical Validation** where observation is the right currency.    | Support staged formality without overloading early drafts.  |
| **CC-E14-10 (Structural grounding handshake).** | A published structural assertion **SHALL** declare the author's `validationMode=axiomatic` posture and link through `tv:groundedBy` to exactly one current C.2.1 construction-trace episteme in a C.13 `sum`, `set`, or `slice` form. The direct relation pattern and the candidate's identity or reidentification rule decide occurrence and continuity; the trace and mode create neither and guarantee no timelessness. | Makes the assertion's construction basis inspectable while keeping ontology, identity, assurance, and currentness separate. |
| **CC‑E14‑11 (Empirical bindings).**        | When `validationMode=postulate` (or when adding real-world confirmation), authors **SHALL** bind evidence through an evidence-use relation in a declared `U.BoundedContext`, with an explicit target claim, scope, **timespan**, and provenance anchors. | Aligns with Evidence Graph Referring and empirical ageing policies. |
| **CC-E14-12 (F-declaration).**             | Normative Working-Model publications **SHALL** declare `U.Formality = Fk` per **C.2.3** (**recommended F ≥ F3** for readable publications). Assurance publications or records **MAY** carry higher F; **min-F** applies to composites. | Aligns E.14 with the unified Formality characteristic; avoids obsolete “tiers/modes”. |
| **CC‑E14‑13 (Light records, not thin prose).** | Authors **SHALL NOT** use the Working‑Model-first stance as a reason to strip problem framing, rationale, or worked slices out of the pattern text. Ordinary use may stay light, but readers **MUST** still be able to understand the pattern without nearby project notes. | Keeps human-facing economy from collapsing into under-explained prose. |
| **CC‑E14‑14 (Recognition text before assurance text).** | When a pattern claims a Working‑Model or other human-facing benefit, authors **SHALL** keep recognition-first working text distinct from the heavier assurance text. The assurance text **MAY** refine and justify the working text, but it **SHALL NOT** silently change the recognition-text claim. If the pattern claims broad or transdisciplinary reach, the working text **SHOULD** show heterogeneous situations early, preferably through an `F.16`-style example matrix or an equally explicit alternative. | Keeps Working‑Model-first drafting from collapsing into either thin prose or late-only universality. |

*All obligations above are **conceptual** and apply to thought and prose; they introduce no notational or data‑processing requirements.*

**E — Conceptual Examples (no notation, no data handling)**

1. **Exact skid assembly -> “Component Of”**
   For PumpSkid 7, recover the exact pump, frame, reservoir, valve set, and other constituents; the direct fastening, coupling, enclosure, terminal, flange, and seal occurrences that obtain; the applicable skid assembly rule; and the skid reidentification rule. The team may then publish each truthful **Component Of** claim and, when assurance is current, link it to one C.2.1 `sum` trace that reports that basis. The same parts unconnected or assembled differently do not thereby form PumpSkid 7. A permitted pump replacement may preserve PumpSkid 7. The direct relations and reidentification rule decide; the trace and `axiomatic` posture do not.

2. **Exact collection memberships -> “Member Of”**
   For a four-cartridge bank, identify the exact collection, its collection-identity rule, and each direct membership occurrence. A C.13 `set` trace can then report that construction for assurance. Parallel use, physical proximity, a list, or an author's gathering act does not license **Member Of**, does not imply **Component Of**, and does not make the bank an acting system.

3. **Exact bearer, facet, and aspect -> “Aspect Of”**
   For the thermal envelope of one reactor, identify the exact reactor bearer, the exact thermal-envelope aspect, the governed thermal facet, the direct **Aspect Of** occurrence, and the aspect's identity rule. A C.13 `slice` trace can report those facts. Selecting a view, naming a facet, carving a diagram, or choosing a time window creates no aspect occurrence and no independent system.

> **Notes across the examples**
> • Everyday labels (*Component Of, Member Of, Aspect Of*) remain the only labels engineers need to see; direct relation facts make them true or false, and the linked construction account makes their basis inspectable.
> • Structural assertions use Constructive assurance under this pattern; epistemic assertions such as “Representation Of” or “Usage Of” use the direct logical or evidence relation appropriate to the claim.

**F — Resulting Context (after you apply the pattern)**

**What improves**

* **One readable structural vocabulary.** Teams can ask which exact relation obtains—component, member, aspect, or another direct kind—without exposing assurance machinery in ordinary work. Assurance readers can still recover the participants, direct relation facts, construction rule, and identity conditions behind a published assertion.
* **Explicit identity tests.** Input lists and traces do not decide identity. Different assembly relations can make the same listed inputs another whole; an admitted replacement can preserve one whole. Collections use their own identity rule and exact memberships; aspects use the exact bearer, facet, direct relation, and aspect identity.
* **Layer harmony.** Engineer-facing labels live at the same level as other relation names, while their warrants and construction accounts live one step below, keeping human language clean and the claim basis auditable.

**What to watch**

* **Discipline for structural relation kinds.** A published structural assertion is unsafe when its direct relation basis or identity test is missing, even if a trace or `axiomatic` flag exists. Conversely, forcing epistemic links to pretend they are structural over-physicalises knowledge claims; for those, a direct logical or evidence relation is the right currency.
* **Author workload moves, not grows.** Day-to-day model authors stay with working labels; specification authors must recover the direct relation occurrence and identity test and keep one current construction account when this publication policy requires it. The account supports review; it does not repair missing world-side facts.

**Invariants you must preserve**

* **Parsimony of construction accounts.** Use `sum` to report integrated assembly, `set` to report a governed collection, and `slice` to report an exact aspect. Do not treat them as generative acts or add forms for parallelism or time-slicing; order and time remain with their direct conceptual services.
* **Relation-kind-specific justification.** Structural claims require independently grounded direct relations plus an inspectable construction account under this policy; epistemic claims require their direct logical or evidence relations. Neither assurance route changes the governed relation kind.

**Known consequences**

* **Stable queries, fewer surprises.** Working labels retain one direct meaning across disciplines, while each published structural assertion can be followed to the facts and identity conditions reported in its construction account.
* **Audit trail without jargon.** Reviewers can follow a structural claim to its exact participants, direct relation occurrences, construction rule, identity conditions, and current trace edition while everyday collaborators keep using familiar relation names.

### E.14:9 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Machinery-first working text | The reader meets constructor traces, proof apparatus, or evidence ids before the working model. | Put the recognition text and chosen Working-Model labels first; keep assurance below. |
| Assurance leakage upward | Mapping, proof, or empirical records rename the public working vocabulary. | Preserve downward grounding: Working-Model terms are not back-defined by assurance publications. |
| Slash-label compromise | Several source labels are displayed because no chosen governed value was selected. | Use Mapping to record source labels and show one chosen Working-Model label. |
| Structure-time collapse | Order, phase, or execution is encoded as part-whole structure. | Keep time and order in their governing relation families. |
| Forever-light prose | Human-facing prose becomes so small that the reader cannot recover the problem, payoff, or assurance boundary. | Keep recognition text concise but still include problem framing, rationale, and worked slices. |

### E.14:10 - Consequences

| Benefits                                                                                                                                                      | Trade‑offs / Mitigations                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Human‑first clarity.** Readers see the **Working‑Model layer** as the canonical publication form; Assurance layers remain optional and purpose‑driven.      | **Extra author discipline.** Declaring the stance and (when needed) a short grounding narrative takes effort; mitigated by the authoring template and style guide.           |
| **Progressive assurance.** Teams can start light and raise strictness deliberately (Mapping → Logical → Constructive) without changing the visible relations. | **Risk of “forever‑light.”** Some models may remain in low‑assurance stances; mitigated by formal maturity checks and assurance prompts to escalate where risk warrants.  |
| **Layer hygiene.** Order/time remain outside mereology; structural identity is neither overloaded nor diluted.                                                | **Split attention.** Authors must learn to keep relation families distinct; mitigated by the Tell-Show-Show pedagogy across architectural patterns.                                             |
| **Spec cohesion.** The same section order and safety subsections (Bias‑Annotation, Conformance Checklist) keep patterns comparable and auditable.             | **Tighter prose.** Patterns grow by a few concise checks; mitigated by the canonical template.                                                                               |

### E.14:11 - Rationale

**Why Working-Model is canonical.** FPF privileges **human-oriented relations** as the primary language and working representation for thinking and communication. This satisfies didactic primacy while preserving conceptual integrity: formal work serves the human layer, not the other way around. The canonical template and style principles institutionalise this choice without inviting notation lock-in.

**Why grounding flows downward.** Mapping, Logical, Constructive, and Empirical supports are **assurance shoulders** that sit *beneath* the Working‑Model claim. Authors select the shoulder(s) that fit purpose and risk: type/lexical alignment (**TA**), reasoned consequence (**VA**), constructive reconstruction (**VA**), and real‑world confirmation (**LA**). This keeps the Kernel small, avoids plane‑mixing, and provides a clear path to higher-assurance guarantees when warranted.

**Why patterns teach before they tighten.** The Tell‑Show‑Show requirement couples each universal rule with System/Episteme illustrations, reducing cognitive load and preventing premature formalism. It is the didactic mechanism that makes Human‑Centric Canonization practical across disciplines.

**Why no notation talk in Core.** Guard‑rails and the style guide prohibit tool jargon and notation dependence inside normative prose; meanings are given in words and mathematics, with any renderings treated as illustrative only. This preserves longevity and cross‑disciplinary portability.

### E.14:12 - SoTA-Echoing

| Source line | What E.14 adopts | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Human-centered design and cognitive ergonomics | Working readers need a small, usable model before assurance apparatus. | Usability does not license vague or under-explained prose. |
| Formal methods and model-based assurance | Heavy justification can remain available below the working text. | Assurance artifacts do not define the public Working-Model vocabulary. |
| Ontology engineering and mapping practice | Source labels, synonyms, and registers are captured in mapping rather than shown as slash labels. | Mapping is not a second public vocabulary. |
| Constructive ontology and constructional mereology | Structural claims can carry an inspectable account of independently grounded construction facts when identity matters. | The account creates neither the direct relation nor whole identity and is not the default assurance route for epistemic claims. |

### E.14:13 - Relations

**Builds on:**

* **E.8 Authoring Conventions & Style Guide** — section order, style principles, and mandatory safety subsections used here.
* **E.7 Archetypal Grounding** — the Tell‑Show‑Show rule applied in this pattern’s own Grounding section.
* **C.2.3 Unified Formality Characteristic (F)** — declares the **F** scale and **ΔF** moves for progressive rigor; Working-Model publications **SHALL** declare **F** and remain notation-agnostic.

**Coordinates with.**

* **CT2R‑LOG — Working‑Model Relations & Grounding** — label-meaning rules and `tv:groundedBy` Standard for edges grounded in Γₘ.
* **Compose-CAL (Constructional Mereology)** — supplies the `sum`, `set`, and `slice` forms for a C.2.1 construction-trace episteme about independently grounded structural facts; the trace does not define the Working-Model relation or its identity.
* **E.10 Lexical Discipline & Stratification** — ensures naming discipline and register hygiene when the human layer is published.

**Constrains:**

* All architectural patterns that publish relations **SHALL** present them in the Working-Model layer and **MAY** attach assurance only as needed, preserving relation-family separation and notational independence. (Template conformance as per E.8.)

**Informs.**

* Part F unification practices (context of meaning, bridges, fit levels) by reinforcing the preference for human‑readable labels with explicit alignment notes rather than silent formal substitutions.
