## F.6 - RoleAssignment and Performed-Work Attribution Check

> **Type:** Boundary and use pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

### F.6:0 - Use This When

**Plain name.** Check who performed this work under which role assignment.

Use this pattern when deciding whether one exact dated Work individual `W : U.Work` was performed under one exact obtaining assignment occurrence `RA : U.RoleAssignment`. When it was, the direct world-side relation `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` obtains. A separate attribution assertion or record may designate `W` and `RA` and state that the relation obtains.

Typical moments include:

- a work record says "Alice reviewed", "Robot-7 inspected", or "the operations team approved", but the exact assignment episode is missing;
- a method description names a work-facing role and the project must connect performed work to the system that held that role;
- source wording says `RoleEnactment`, "played the role", or `Holder#Role:Context@Window`, and the direct work-to-assignment relation must be recovered;
- a report, standard, dashboard, access label, or other episteme is described with role language even though it did not perform the work;
- a role label is reused under another role taxonomy or reference scheme and local attribution would be unsafe without an explicit bridge.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** One obtaining direct `performedUnderAssignment` relation occurrence between one exact `U.Work` occurrence and one exact `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence.

**Primary working reader.** An engineer, operator, method author, manager, or FPF author deciding whether a performed-work attribution is grounded strongly enough for the next use.

**First useful move.** Name the Work occurrence and the assignment occurrence that may participate in the attribution relation. Recover the assignment's holder system, role value, role-taxonomy episteme, effective reference scheme, and assignment window before deciding whether `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` obtains.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Assignment is treated as proof that work happened; a work log names a person but not the assignment episode; a context-like word hides the role taxonomy and interpretation scheme; or an episteme is made the performer because it described, constrained, or evidenced the work.

**What this buys.** Work attribution becomes a direct, inspectable relation while role state, capability, method fit, evidence, source use, result, publication, and cross-scheme correspondence remain with their own governing patterns.

**Not this pattern when.** Use `A.2` for the role value, `A.2.1` for the assignment occurrence, `A.2.5` for a current role-state predicate, `A.2.2` for capability, and `A.15.1` for the work occurrence. Use `A.10`, `A.15.4`, `E.17`, or another direct pattern when the current claim is evidence use, source reliance, publication, status, gate, or decision. Use `A.6.5` when "role" means a relation position rather than a work-facing `U.Role`.

### F.6:1 - Problem Frame

`U.RoleAssignment` admits assignment-relation occurrences; `U.Work` admits Work individuals. One exact `RA : U.RoleAssignment` is a world-side assignment-relation occurrence that relates an admitted holder System to one role value, one role-taxonomy episteme, and one effective reference scheme and obtains throughout one assignment episode. One exact `W : U.Work` is a dated world-side Work occurrence. The existence of `RA` and `W` does not by itself establish the additional world-side attribution between them: `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` must separately obtain. A distinct assertion or record may designate `RA` and `W`, state that `RA` obtains, state that `W` occurred, or state that the attribution relation obtains.

F.6 governs the missing direct relation. The assignment is one participant and the work occurrence is the other. A roster row may assert the assignment; a work log may assert the work and attribution; evidence may support either assertion. Those epistemes help a system know or use the relation, but they do not become relation participants and do not make the world-side relation obtain merely by being recorded.

This separation matters because assignment, state, ability, performance, evidence, and acceptance can vary independently. A system can hold a role and do no work. It can perform poor work under a valid assignment. A report can accurately describe the work without performing it. One compact "enactment" label hides these distinctions.

### F.6:2 - Problem

Without the direct attribution relation, recurring engineering failures appear:

1. **Assignment-as-work.** Current role holding is treated as evidence that the assigned system performed a particular occurrence.
2. **Performer by label.** A name such as `Reviewer` or `Operator` is used without the assignment episode that fixes holder, role interpretation, and time.
3. **Assignment-episode mismatch.** The assignment interval does not cover the work interval, yet attribution is accepted.
4. **Support-as-constitution.** A log, report, standard, dashboard, or decision is treated as what makes the attribution obtain rather than as an assertion or support relation.
5. **Duplicate enactment ontology.** `RoleEnactment` or `RoleEnactmentFact` becomes a second object beside the dated work and its direct `performedUnderAssignment` relation.
6. **Hidden locality.** A generic context field replaces the role-taxonomy episteme, effective reference scheme, assignment window, or an independently selected model-use structure.

### F.6:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| Readability vs exact identity | Ordinary prose should remain short, while reliance-bearing use may need the exact work and assignment occurrences. |
| Assignment vs performance | Assignment makes performance possible to attribute; it does not make performance happen. |
| World-side obtaining vs knowledge | The relation can obtain even when current evidence is missing; missing support makes the relied-on assertion unresolved, not the work unperformed. |
| Local interpretation vs reuse | The same role word can denote different role values under different taxonomies and schemes. |
| Thin attribution vs neighboring checks | Capability, state, method fit, result quality, acceptance, and evidence may matter downstream without becoming attribution participants. |

### F.6:4 - Solution

Govern performed-work attribution as one direct relation species under `U.Relation`.

#### F.6:4.1 - Direct Relation Declaration

```text
performedUnderAssignment : U.Relation
  WorkOccurrenceSlot: U.Work, U.EntityRef
  RoleAssignmentSlot: U.RoleAssignment, U.EntityRef

when performedUnderAssignment(W, RA) obtains:
  actualPerformerSystem(W, RA) := RA.HolderSystemSlot
```

`WorkOccurrenceSlot` names the dated performed occurrence governed by `A.15.1`. `RoleAssignmentSlot` names the obtaining assignment occurrence governed by `A.2.1`.

For an obtaining attribution, the readable actual-performer cue is `S = actualPerformerSystem(W, RA) = RA.HolderSystemSlot`: `S` is the admitted `U.System` that acts, while `RA` is the assignment under which that action is attributed. The projection exposes the actor already carried by the assignment participant; it does not assert attribution when the relation fails to obtain and is not another relation kind or occurrence.

`performedBy(W, RA)` is a deprecated compatibility spelling of `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)`. Existing claims or records may be read through that alias only after resolving `S = RA.HolderSystemSlot`. New practitioner-facing claims, examples, and conformance statements MUST use `S performed W under RA` or `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)`, never wording that makes `RA` the performer.

No evidence, log, status, method description, result, publication, context record, or role-state assertion is a generic participant in this relation.

#### F.6:4.2 - Obtaining and Occurrence Identity

The relation `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` obtains when:

1. `W` is one exact dated `U.Work` occurrence governed by `A.15.1`;
2. `RA` is one obtaining `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence;
3. the holder system in `RA.HolderSystemSlot` actually performed `W` under `RA.RoleValueSlot`;
4. the assignment predicate for `RA` obtains throughout the temporal extent of `W`.

If the performer attribution concerns only a temporal, episode, or operational part of a larger work whole, first identify that part as the `U.Work` occurrence under `A.15.1` and use it in `WorkOccurrenceSlot`. Do not hide an unidentified work portion inside the attribution relation.

When a receiving use needs an explicit relation-occurrence reference, use:

```text
PerformedUnderAssignmentOccurrenceKey = <WorkOccurrenceSlot, RoleAssignmentSlot>
```

The temporal extent is inherited from `WorkOccurrenceSlot`. Extending an open work interval or later recording its end does not create another attribution occurrence while both participants remain the same. A separately identified work occurrence, including a separately identified work part, or a different assignment episode yields a different relation occurrence.

An evidence gap leaves a relied-on attribution assertion unresolved. It does not demonstrate that `performedUnderAssignment` failed to obtain. A demonstrated different performer or non-covering assignment episode can support the stronger negative claim.

#### F.6:4.3 - Recover the Exact Assignment

Before relying on the attribution, recover the four direct participants of the exact assignment occurrence `RA` that fills `RoleAssignmentSlot`:

```text
RoleAssignmentRelationSignature:
  HolderSystemSlot: U.System, U.EntityRef
  RoleValueSlot: U.Role, ByValue
  RoleTaxonomyEpistemeSlot: U.Episteme, U.EpistemeRef
  EffectiveReferenceSchemeSlot: U.ReferenceScheme, ByValue
```

One assignment occurrence is the maximal continuous period during which the assignment predicate obtains for those fixed four participants. A supporting assertion or occurrence description may state `assignmentInterval`, including an open end, but that field is not a participant and does not establish temporal coverage. Verify coverage for `performedUnderAssignment` from the actual obtaining history of the exact assignment occurrence and the exact work extent.

Do not replace these participants with one `Context` value. If source notation contains `Context`, recover what that token denotes and send it to its direct pattern. It may denote an actual system or work locus, a claim scope, or an independently selected `BoundedModelUseStructure`; those objects have different kinds and relations. A selected model-use structure can qualify the receiving attribution assertion, but it is not an optional participant of generic `U.RoleAssignment`.

#### F.6:4.4 - Attribution Check Sequence

Use this short sequence for the current attribution claim:

1. Name the exact `U.Work` occurrence whose performer is being asserted.
2. Name or recover the exact `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence through its four fixed participants and uninterrupted obtaining extent.
3. Check that the holder system named by the assignment is the system claimed to have performed the work.
4. Check that the assignment episode covers the attributed work interval.
5. State the direct `performedUnderAssignment(WorkOccurrenceSlot, RoleAssignmentSlot)` relation, or keep the attribution assertion unresolved when support is insufficient.
6. Send role state, capability, method fit, evidence, source use, result, acceptance, publication, and bridge questions to their direct governing patterns.

The sequence is application guidance, not a new check record, work plan, or workflow object. Its useful result is the repaired direct relation or an explicit stop at the missing relation participant or support claim.

#### F.6:4.5 - Direct Neighboring Relations

| Current question | Direct exit | Why it stays separate |
|---|---|---|
| Does the assignment obtain? | `A.2.1` | Assignment identity and occurrence precede work attribution. |
| Does the assignment satisfy a current state predicate? | `A.2.5` | Role state has its own predicate, window, assertion, and evidence use. |
| Can the holder perform the work? | `A.2.2` capability and capability-fit relation | Ability is not actual performance. |
| Which method was enacted? | `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, and `A.15.1` | Method, method description, and work occurrence have different identities. |
| What supports the attribution assertion? | `A.10` or the direct evidence relation | Support concerns knowledge or use of obtaining. |
| Which encountered material is being relied upon? | `A.15.4` | Reliance on a visible item is not the attribution relation. |
| What changed, first existed, was measured or evaluated, was delivered, or was accepted in connection with the work? | `A.15.1` for the work, then the exact change, A.6.1 operation-result, A.15.PROD inception, measurement, evaluation, delivery, or acceptance governor | None of these entities, values, or relations is a participant in performer attribution. |
| Does another vocabulary denote a corresponding role? | `F.9` | A bridge does not mutate either local assignment. |
| Does a model-use organization change this attribution interpretation? | `A.1.1` plus the receiving attribution assertion or use | The receiving episteme or use may designate the selected structure; generic assignment and attribution signatures gain no optional participant. |

#### F.6:4.6 - Source Shorthand and `RoleEnactment`

`Holder#Role:Context@Window` is readable source notation only. Before reliance-bearing use, recover the assignment's holder system, role value, role-taxonomy episteme, effective reference scheme, and assignment window. Recover the object denoted by `Context` separately.

When source wording says `RoleEnactment` or `RoleEnactmentFact`, recover the dated `U.Work` occurrence and the direct `performedUnderAssignment` relation. Do not retain a second enactment kind, fact object, or relation occurrence.

#### F.6:4.7 - Lightweight Use

Ordinary use can stop at a readable assertion:

```text
InspectionWork-17 was performed by Robot-7 under RoleAssignment-17.
```

Expose the relation declaration and occurrence key only when a receiving use must distinguish attribution occurrences, cite one as a participant, compare assertions, or preserve provenance. If the assignment cannot be recovered, lower the claim to "Robot-7 is named as performer in record R" and route that reliance through `A.15.4` or the direct source and evidence patterns.

### F.6:5 - Invariants

1. Every performed-work attribution relates one exact `U.Work` occurrence to one exact `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence.
2. The assignment occurrence `RA` in `RoleAssignmentSlot` keeps exactly four fixed participants and one maximal continuous obtaining extent; no mandatory `U.BoundedContext`, generic context slot, or optional model-use participant is added.
3. The actual maximal continuous extent of the assignment occurrence covers the attributed portion of the work interval; a declared or recorded window alone does not establish coverage.
4. Assignment does not prove performance, and performance attribution does not prove capability, state, method validity, result quality, or acceptance.
5. `RoleEnactment` wording is repaired to dated work plus direct `performedUnderAssignment`; no duplicate enactment object is retained.
6. Assertions, logs, rosters, evidence, identifiers, and publications remain epistemic or representational objects distinct from world-side relation obtaining.
7. An evidence gap yields unresolved reliance, not an inferred non-attribution interval.
8. An episteme does not fill `HolderSystemSlot` merely because it describes, constrains, or supports the work claim.
9. Cross-scheme role correspondence uses a direct bridge relation and does not change either assignment identity.
10. Reduced prose remains admissible until a receiving use needs explicit relation-occurrence identity.

### F.6:6 - Reasoning Primitives

```text
RA : U.RoleAssignment is one exact obtaining assignment-relation occurrence
  and W : U.Work is one exact dated Work occurrence
  and RA.HolderSystemSlot actually performs W under RA.RoleValueSlot
  and the assignment predicate for RA obtains throughout the attributed work interval
  -> performedUnderAssignment(W, RA) obtains.
```

```text
An attribution assertion lacks adequate current support
  -> reliance on the assertion is unresolved;
  -> do not infer that performedUnderAssignment(W, RA) is false.
```

```text
A source episteme names a performer or role
  -> do not claim that performedUnderAssignment obtains until exact W and RA are recovered.
```

### F.6:7 - Archetypal Grounding

#### F.6:7.1 - Robot Inspection

```text
RoleAssignmentAssertion@RoleAssignment17:
  participantDesignations:
    HolderSystemSlot: Robot-7
    RoleValueSlot: InspectorRole
    RoleTaxonomyEpistemeSlot: MaintenanceRoles-2026
    EffectiveReferenceSchemeSlot: Maintenance-Scheme-A
  assignmentInterval: [2026-07-13T09:00, 2026-07-13T17:00]

performedUnderAssignment:
  WorkOccurrenceSlot: InspectionWork-17
  RoleAssignmentSlot: RoleAssignment-17
```

The assertion interval describes the known extent of `RoleAssignment-17`; the direct assignment predicate must actually obtain throughout `InspectionWork-17` before `performedUnderAssignment` obtains. The relation attributes the inspection occurrence to Robot-7 under that assignment. Sensor capability, calibration state, inspection-method adequacy, report quality, and acceptance remain separate claims.

#### F.6:7.2 - Reviewer and Review Report

Engineer Alice is identified as the exact holder and satisfies the A.1 `U.System` criterion. `ReviewAssignment-82` assigns her `ReviewerRole` under `ReviewRoles-v5` and `Review-Scheme-A` for one uninterrupted review assignment episode. `ReviewWork-82 performedUnderAssignment ReviewAssignment-82` attributes the dated work.

`ReviewReport-82` is a separately identified `U.Episteme`. When `ReviewWork-82` first constitutes that exact episteme and the inception claim matters, A.15.PROD recovers the local work/change/identity claim. A later evidence relation may use the report for a decision. The report never fills `HolderSystemSlot` and never becomes the attribution relation.

#### F.6:7.3 - Standard Used During Safety Work

A safety method description cites a standard, and source prose says that the standard has a "normative role". F.6 does not create a work-facing assignment for the standard. The standard is an episteme used through the exact external-rule, source-use, specification-use, or evidence relation selected by the claim.

A safety engineer or tool system may separately hold `SafetyAnalystRole` and perform dated safety work. That attribution names the engineer's or tool system's assignment; it does not use the standard as performer.

#### F.6:7.4 - Access Label and Approval Work

An access directory says Alice has `DB-Admin`. That entry describes an access or policy relation under its own scheme. It is not automatically a work-facing `ApproverRole` assignment.

If Alice performs `ApprovalWork-481`, recover a separate `U.RoleAssignment` under the role taxonomy used by the approval method and relate the work through `performedUnderAssignment`. The directory entry may support authorization or gate reasoning through its direct pattern; it does not substitute for the work assignment.

### F.6:8 - Bias Annotation

| Bias risk | Failure | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| Record-first bias | A log row or roster identifier is treated as the world-side relation. | Recover the work and assignment occurrences; keep the row as an assertion or publication. |
| Universal-context bias | One context field replaces taxonomy, scheme, occurrence extent, scope, and model-use selection. | Restore the four assignment participants, state its actual extent separately, and route every remaining context-denoted object by kind. |
| Enactment reification | `RoleEnactmentFact` duplicates work and attribution. | Use the direct `performedUnderAssignment` relation. |
| Support-as-constitution | Evidence existence is made an attribution participant. | Keep evidence in the relation supporting use of an attribution assertion. |
| Assignment-as-performance | A staffing decision is treated as completed work. | Name a dated `U.Work` occurrence before attribution. |
| Bridge overreach | A role word from another scheme licenses local attribution. | Recover each local assignment and use `F.9` for correspondence. |

### F.6:9 - Conformance Checklist

1. `WorkOccurrenceSlot` names one admitted dated `U.Work` occurrence.
2. `RoleAssignmentSlot` names one obtaining `U.RoleAssignment` occurrence.
3. The assignment exposes holder system, role value, role-taxonomy episteme, and effective reference scheme as participants; its maximal continuous assignment extent is checked separately.
4. The assignment holder is the system claimed to have performed the work.
5. The assignment episode covers the selected work occurrence's interval; attribution to only one part first selects that part as `U.Work`.
6. The attribution uses direct `performedUnderAssignment` wording and introduces no `RoleEnactmentFact`.
7. Role state, capability, method, result, evidence, source reliance, publication, gate, and decision claims use their direct patterns.
8. Any selected model-use structure is designated by the receiving attribution assertion or use, not by an optional slot in generic `U.RoleAssignment`.
9. Missing evidence leaves the relied-on assertion unresolved rather than proving non-attribution.
10. Compact source notation is unfolded before a receiving use depends on hidden assignment positions.

### F.6:10 - Common Anti-Patterns and Repairs

| Anti-pattern | Failure | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| Assignment proves work | Role holding is confused with dated performance. | Name the `U.Work` occurrence and direct `performedUnderAssignment` relation. |
| Work attributed by role label | Assignment episode and interpretation are unavailable. | Recover the exact `U.RoleAssignment` through its four participants and uninterrupted obtaining extent. |
| Non-covering assignment | Work is attributed outside the assignment episode. | Select the covering assignment occurrence or leave attribution unresolved; do not widen the window by prose. |
| `RoleEnactmentFact` retained | A duplicate object competes with work and attribution. | Replace it with `performedUnderAssignment(WorkOccurrenceSlot, RoleAssignmentSlot)`. |
| Report as performer | A result or evidence episteme is put in holder position. | Keep the report in its work-result, evidence, source, or publication relation. |
| Context shorthand becomes ontology | `Context` is inserted as a universal relation participant. | Recover the exact denoted object and use its direct pattern; generic assignment keeps four participants and derives its episode extent from uninterrupted obtaining. |

### F.6:11 - Consequences

**Benefits.** Assignment and performed work remain independently identifiable, while attribution becomes a direct relation that can be cited, compared, supported, corrected, or left unresolved. The pattern works for people, organizations, machines, and software systems because the holder is always an admitted `U.System`, not a domain-specific performer category.

**Costs.** Reliance-bearing use must recover the exact assignment episode rather than stopping at a familiar role label. A compact source sentence may split into an assignment assertion, a work occurrence, the direct attribution relation, an exact change or production claim, an operation-result binding or result episteme, and any evidence relation current for the use.

**Limits.** F.6 does not determine capability, readiness, method validity, work success, result acceptance, authorization, or evidence sufficiency. It only governs the relation by which one performed work occurrence is attributed to one role assignment.

### F.6:12 - Rationale

The direct relation is needed because `U.RoleAssignment` and `U.Work` admit different kinds of world-side occurrence. One obtaining assignment occurrence `RA` relates its holder System to a role value under one interpretation and throughout one episode; one Work individual `W : U.Work` is the dated Work occurrence. `performedUnderAssignment(W, RA)` either obtains or does not obtain as the additional world-side attribution between them. A distinct assertion or record may designate `RA` and `W`, state that `RA` obtains, state that `W` occurred, or state that the attribution relation obtains.

Making a log, status, decision, or evidence item a relation participant would confuse world-side attribution with knowledge of attribution. Creating `RoleEnactmentFact` would duplicate the same pair under a second identity. The two-participant relation preserves realism and keeps correction local: changing an evidence use does not rewrite work or assignment; discovering a different performer changes the attribution assertion and, when demonstrated, the selected relation occurrence.

### F.6:13 - SoTA-Echoing and Source Use

| Source line | Contribution | FPF use |
|---|---|---|
| FPF `A.2.1`, `A.2.5`, and `A.15.1` | Separate assignment occurrence, role-state relation, and dated work occurrence. | Adopt directly: `performedUnderAssignment` relates exact work and assignment occurrences without importing state or evidence as participants. |
| Almeida, Guizzardi, Sales, and Fonseca, [gUFO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.20948), 2026 preprint | Current foundational-ontology comparator separates role-like classification, relation aspects, and explicit relation occurrences. | Keep `U.Role`, `U.RoleAssignment`, and `performedUnderAssignment` distinct; use FPF's own system-holder and occurrence-identity rules rather than importing the comparator's hierarchy. |
| W3C [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/), mature 2013 Recommendation used as representation lineage | Qualified association distinguishes activity, agent, role, and plan inside a provenance description. | Preserve the useful separation while keeping the provenance episteme distinct from world-side work, assignment, and attribution obtaining. |
| [OCEL 2.0 Specification](https://www.ocel-standard.org/specification/overview/), 2024 event-log representation practice | Events, objects, event-to-object relations, object-to-object relations, and relation qualifiers are represented explicitly. | Use an OCEL row as an assertion or evidence only after work and assignment identities are recovered; qualified log relations do not become the performed work or its world-side attribution by storage form. |

These lines discipline the examples rather than supply a foreign ontology. FPF takes the useful separation pressure and retains its own constructive relation, work, role-assignment, episteme, and evidence distinctions.

### F.6:14 - Relations

**Builds on:** `A.6.REL` for relation obtaining and occurrence identity; `A.2` for `U.Role`; `A.2.1` for `U.RoleAssignment`; and `A.15.1` for dated `U.Work`.

**Uses when current:** `A.2.5` for role state; `A.2.2` for capability; `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, and `A.15` for method and work alignment; `A.10` for evidence; `A.15.4` for reliance on encountered project material; `F.9` for cross-scheme correspondence; and `A.1.1` only when an independently selected model-use structure changes assignment interpretation.

**Coordinates with:** `F.4` for role-description epistemes; `F.5` and `F.18` for durable names; `E.17` for publication; and `E.10` for source-word precision repair.

### F.6:15 - Completion Conditions

F.6 use is complete when the reader has either:

- one direct `performedUnderAssignment` relation between an exact work occurrence and an exact assignment occurrence;
- an unresolved attribution assertion with the missing assignment, interval, or support relation named;
- or a corrected exit to the direct pattern because the encountered claim concerns assignment, state, capability, method, evidence, source reliance, result, publication, gate, or decision rather than performed-work attribution.

### F.6:End
