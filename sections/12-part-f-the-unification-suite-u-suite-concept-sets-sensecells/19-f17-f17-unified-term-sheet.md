## F.17 - Unified Term Sheet
> **Type:** Lexical publication pattern (F)
> **Status:** Stable

Use this when a term decision is to become reader-facing, durable, public, Core-facing, or cross-context. Use it when a role name, status name, relation name, slot name, FPF kind name, local concept name, or bridgeable term set has outgrown one local repair and publication as one reviewed term row is current.

First useful move: identify the governed term decision, not the wording alone. Name the governed value and its kind, the effective `U.ReferenceScheme` carried by value, the exact local-sense coordinate, and the current direct pattern that owns the underlying value. When the row will compare local senses, compare their semantic-context projections: the `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` pairs recovered from the exact cells. If those pairs differ, test an F.9 Bridge and, for a proposed row use, state the separate C.2.1 claim and its A.10 or B.3 reliance. A cross-scheme case is only the subset in which the `ReferenceScheme` values differ. Then publish only the term-row facts already governed there. A locality label or selected model-use structure enters only when it changes the naming use; neither is a mandatory sense coordinate.

Primary EntityOfConcern: one durable reader-facing term decision published by one `UnifiedTermRow` in one bounded unification thread. The role, status value, relation, slot kind, local concept, demonstrated row, or other underlying governed value remains the EntityOfConcern of its direct pattern; F.17 publishes its term decision and does not reconstitute that value.

What goes wrong if missed: a public term sheet becomes a global glossary, a row turns into an ontology claim, a block name becomes a subtype, or a familiar label smuggles role, status, evidence, publication, or source authority into reuse.

What this pattern buys: a compact reader-facing row that preserves the governed object, direct pattern, local senses, bridge, selected names, admissible use, blocked use, and currentness condition without redoing the whole unification argument.

Do not use this pattern for one sentence repair, one private glossary note, one local synonym choice, or one attempt to make an object real by putting it into a table. A Plain local mantra that keeps one bounded result in attention and a Plain long mantra that keeps a dependency across direct patterns both need no UTS row; phrase length decides neither scope. Use `E.10`, `A.6.P`, `C.2.P`, `F.18`, or the direct domain pattern first when the kind, relation, slot position, admissible use, or name-card decision is still unsettled.

### F.17:1 - Intent and applicability

`UnifiedTermSheet` is a reader-facing term publication for one bounded unification thread. It gives a careful reader one compact table of reviewed term rows: the chosen Tech and Plain names, the governed value and its kind, the local senses, the Bridge relation when the exact local-sense projections differ and a correspondence use is current, and the small rationale that makes the naming decision reviewable.

The pattern is useful when a team has already done enough local sense work that a name can be reused without redoing the whole unification argument each time. It is especially useful for:

- public role names and role names reused under more than one interpretation scheme;
- status-family names and status-window labels;
- durable relation, slot, interface, or signature names;
- FPF kind names and local concept names that appear under more than one effective reference scheme or reader-facing use;
- term rows cited by examples, training material, project standards, or tool interfaces;
- Part G, architecture, transformation, and evaluation vocabulary whose row ids remain stable across editions.

`F.17` does not create `U.Role`, `U.Status`, `U.Evidence`, `U.Method`, `U.Work`, `U.Episteme`, `U.Relation`, `U.SlotKind`, or any other underlying object. It publishes a term row for an already governed object, relation, slot, or local concept. The direct pattern remains responsible for the object and its admissible use.

### F.17:2 - Problem frame

Unification work often succeeds locally and then fails in reuse. A term looks stable in one section, but another reader cannot see which governed value, effective reference scheme, local-sense claim, Bridge, NameCard decision, or direct governing pattern was used. Teams then invent new labels, import one local interpretation as if it were universal, or treat a teaching block as if it were an ontology.

The damage is practical:

- local meanings become global slogans;
- one row silently mixes a role, a role description, a status value, a capability claim, and a work assignment;
- public names drift because no row id, edition, or name-card reference stays stable;
- sameness across different semantic-context projections is asserted by spelling instead of by two separate premises: an actual F.9 Bridge that obtains under its relation-semantic profile, and an affirmative C.2.1 claim that says the Bridge is suitable for the row's exact direction, correspondence rule, and loss tolerance, with current A.10 or B.3 reliance;
- examples in other patterns cite a term but not the term decision that makes the example portable.

`F.17` fixes this by making the term row itself reviewable. Each row says what kind of thing is being named, where the local senses came from, what bridge is claimed, which name was selected, and which direct pattern owns the underlying object.

### F.17:2.1 - Problem

A public term row can make a local word look reusable while hiding the governed object, effective scheme, exact local-sense claim, obtaining Bridge, separate claim about the row's use, reliance basis, direct pattern, currentness condition, or blocked overread. The problem is to publish a compact term decision that travels across examples, training material, interfaces, and projects without turning the sheet itself into an ontology, evidence source, permission, or proof that the named use occurred.

### F.17:3 - Forces

| Force | F.17 settlement |
| --- | --- |
| Reader memory vs full provenance | Keep one compact row for use, with enough references to reopen the sense, bridge, and name decision. |
| Local meaning vs reuse across different semantic-context projections | Local senses are exact coordinates under by-value reference schemes; every correspondence or substitution claim is explicit and governed by F.9. A changed scheme is only one way the projections can differ; a changed `LocalSenseClaim` under the same scheme also opens the F.9 question. |
| Naming neutrality vs recognizability | `F.18` and `F.5` choose names that readers can use without smuggling one context's commitments into the row. |
| Didactic grouping vs ontology | Blocks help memory; blocks do not create subtypes, roles, statuses, or families. |
| Row stability vs edition change | Row ids survive reblocking and wording updates; edition-sensitive fields show what changed. |
| Compact table vs semio-bias | The table publishes term decisions without replacing the direct pattern that governs the object. |

### F.17:4 - Solution

A Unified Term Sheet is a table of term rows for one bounded unification thread.

Publish one term decision through this sequence:

1. Confirm that the direct pattern already governs the underlying value and its admissible use. If the kind, relation, slot position, or use is unsettled, return there before term publication.
2. Decide whether the name now needs durable reader-facing reuse: public publication, reuse across different semantic-context projections, stable citation, training use, interface use, or editioned maintenance. Otherwise keep the wording local and stop.
3. Recover each exact local sense under one effective `U.ReferenceScheme` carried by value. Cite a `SenseCellAddressRef` that resolves to the F.17 scheme-based coordinate `<reference scheme by value, local expression, local-sense claim>`; do not require or infer a `U.BoundedContext`.
4. Use F.18 and F.5 to select the Tech and Plain names for the governed value, and cite the resulting NameCard. If no NameCard decision is current, the term is not ready for F.17 publication.
5. When the row proposes correspondence between local senses whose `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projections differ, cite two premises in order. The projections may differ because the `LocalSenseClaim` differs even when the `ReferenceScheme` is the same; different schemes are only a common subset and do not establish a Bridge. First cite an actual F.9 Bridge for the named endpoint cells and editions and show that its relation-semantic profile applies, its Boolean predicate is true, and its required dependencies are present. Second cite an exact current C.2.1 claim with that Bridge as EntityOfConcern and affirmative polarity for the row's named use, direction, use-specific correspondence rule, and permitted-loss tolerance. Recover current reliance through the exact A.10 evidence-provenance relation plus local `RelianceDisposition=pass`, or the positive B.3 assurance branch when B.3 is triggered. A negative claim or non-passing reliance rejects or weakens the row use without negating or reidentifying an otherwise obtaining Bridge. When the projections are the same, route a different expression to F.18 designation and add no Bridge. When no semantic-correspondence use is current, add no Bridge or Bridge-use claim regardless of how many schemes are present.
6. Publish one `UnifiedTermRow` with one governed term decision, direct pattern, selected names, scheme-based sense coordinates, row rationale, admissible and blocked use, edition, and currentness condition. Split unlike governed values into separate rows.
7. Apply the static and regression checks, then stop at term publication. Any later object, evidence, authority, work, or subject-use claim returns to its direct pattern.

Each row has one primary term decision:

```text
UnifiedTermRow:
  UTSRowId
  UnificationThreadId
  Block
  GovernedValueRef: U.EntityRef
  GovernedValueKindRef: U.KindRef
  DirectGoverningPatternRef: U.EntityRef, referencing one U.MethodDescription
  UnifiedTechName
  UnifiedPlainName
  NameCardRef: U.EntityRef, referencing one F.18 NameCard
  SenseCellRefs[]: SenseCellAddressRef, each resolving one F.17 SchemeSenseCell(ReferenceScheme, LocalExpression, LocalSenseClaim) coordinate
  BridgeRefs[]: U.EntityRef, referencing actual F.9 Bridges only; any AdmissibleUse between different semantic-context projections separately cites its exact C.2.1 claim and A.10 or B.3 reliance basis in the row rationale or notes
  RowRationale
  AdmissibleUse
  BlockedUse
  RowEdition
  CurrentnessCondition
  Notes?
```

The row may cite several local senses and several Bridges, but it does not fuse their underlying objects. If a source phrase points toward multiple typed FPF values, split the row or cite the direct pattern that keeps the values distinct.

### F.17:5 - Minimal vocabulary

#### F.17:5.1 - Scheme-based local-sense coordinate and basis relation

A local sense is not grounded merely because its expression has an accepted name. F.17 therefore separates the scheme-based local-sense coordinate, the naming settlement, and any episteme used as the basis for the sense claim.

```text
SchemeSenseCell:
  ValueKind: F.17-local composite coordinate; not a root U-kind
  ReferenceScheme: U.ReferenceScheme carried by value
  LocalSenseId: address designator only
  LocalExpression
  LocalSenseClaim
  Identity: <ReferenceScheme by value, LocalExpression, LocalSenseClaim>

LocalSenseBasisRelation@Context <: U.Relation
SlotSpecs:
  LocalSenseCellSlot:
    ValueKind: F.17 SchemeSenseCell coordinate
    RefKind: SenseCellAddressRef, resolving SenseCell(ReferenceSchemeId, LocalSenseId) to the exact scheme, expression, and local-sense claim
    Field: localSenseCellRef
  BasisEpistemeSlot:
    ValueKind: U.Episteme
    RefKind: U.EpistemeRef
    Field: basisEpistemeRef
    Constraint: the reference resolves to the exact basis-episteme kind; that kind is derived, not copied as another participant
  BasisPublicationUnitSlot?:
    ValueKind: PublicationUnit under E.17.AUD
    RefKind: PublicationUnitRef
    Field: basisPublicationUnitRef
RelationRefKind: U.EntityRef constrained to LocalSenseBasisRelation@Context
Direction: basisEpistemeRef -> localSenseCellRef
Obtaining: the exact current basis-episteme edition, at the cited PublicationUnit when present, supports the coordinate's exact LocalSenseClaim under the coordinate's by-value ReferenceScheme for the stated admitted use
NonObtaining: shared spelling, a NameCard, a file or carrier, publication availability, or an uncited source title does not make this relation obtain
Identity: <localSenseCellRef, basisEpistemeRef, basisPublicationUnitRef if present>; the scheme, expression, and sense claim are already identity-bearing inside localSenseCellRef, and the episteme edition is already identity-bearing inside basisEpistemeRef
OccurrenceIdentity: participant-determined; changed coordinate, basis-episteme edition, or cited publication unit identifies another occurrence

LocalSenseBasisRelationDescription@Context <: U.Episteme:
  entityOfConcernRef: U.EntityRef, referencing one LocalSenseBasisRelation@Context
  entityOfConcernKindRef: U.KindRef, referencing LocalSenseBasisRelation@Context
  viewpointRef?: U.ViewpointRef
  subjectRef?: U.SubjectRef, only when independently governed and without adding a context participant
  claimGraph: U.ClaimGraph by value, carrying the supported-sense claim, admitted-use claim, and non-admitted-use claim
  referenceScheme: U.ReferenceScheme by value; exactly the scheme in localSenseCellRef
  editionId
```

`SenseCellAddressRef` is the F.17 reference form for `SchemeSenseCell`. Its readable `SenseCell(...)` spelling is an address, not a claim that a SenseCell is a U-kind or that a context holon exists. A legacy F.3 address of the form `SenseCell(ContextId, LocalSenseId)` may be consumed only when an explicit adapter resolves `ContextId` to one exact effective reference scheme and the same local expression and sense claim. If that resolution is absent or lossy, stop the row; do not reconstruct `U.BoundedContext`.

The retained `@Context` suffix on `LocalSenseBasisRelation@Context` is lineage-compatible vocabulary for bounded local use, not a participant declaration. New occurrences have no `U.BoundedContext` slot. A legacy record may retain `boundedContextRef` only as non-participant address metadata when it resolves to the same exact scheme-based coordinate; otherwise that record is not current for an F.17 row.

`basisPublicationUnitRef` narrows a relied-on pattern or publication episteme to the exact bounded unit when that precision matters. It does not turn a file, slide carrier, rendering, or publication occurrence into the supporting episteme.

The basis relation says only that the named episteme supports the named local-sense claim for the stated use. Its description says which claim is supported and which uses are admitted or blocked. A changed NameCard reopens the selected expression. A changed scheme, local expression, local-sense claim, basis-episteme edition, or cited publication unit identifies or selects another basis occurrence. A changed supported-use boundary creates another relation-description edition without silently changing the basis relation.

`UnifiedTermSheet` is the whole reader-facing term table for one bounded unification thread.

`UnifiedTermRow` is one local F.17 publication-row form in that sheet. It publishes one reviewed term decision and is not a root U-kind or the underlying governed value.

`UnificationThreadId` identifies the bounded naming thread that groups this row with related term decisions. It is a sheet-local identifier, not an ontological locality bearer; `RowEdition` identifies the row edition.

`GovernedValueRef` references the exact value being named. `GovernedValueKindRef` separately references its kind. When the term names a kind token, such as `DemonstrativeUnfoldingSlice@Context`, the governed value is that token and its kind is `U.Kind`; the direct subject pattern states which kinds of instances the token admits. When the term names a role value, relation value, status value, slot kind, or local concept, the two positions reference that value and its exact governed kind. No union field or generic kind container substitutes for this pair.

`DirectGoverningPatternRef` names the pattern that owns the underlying value or claim. `F.17` owns the term-row publication, not that value.

`SchemeSenseCell` is the exact F.17 local-sense coordinate. It binds one local expression and sense claim to one effective `U.ReferenceScheme` carried by value. A `NameCardRef` may accompany it when F.18 selected the expression. A separate `LocalSenseBasisRelationRef` relates the coordinate to a supporting episteme; the relation description carries the supported-sense and use-boundary claims, and the NameCard fills neither position.

`BridgeRef` cites an actual F.9 Bridge only when it obtains for the exact scheme-based endpoints under a relation-semantic profile that applies, has a true Boolean predicate, and has every required dependency present. The reference carries no row-use direction, rule, tolerance, polarity, reliance, or permission. An `AdmissibleUse` between different `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projections separately cites the exact affirmative C.2.1 claim about that Bridge and names its current A.10 or B.3 reliance basis. A scheme difference alone supplies neither premise.

`UnifiedTechName` and `UnifiedPlainName` are the selected names governed by F.5 and F.18. Extra aliases belong in the NameCard or local lexicon material, not as rival unified names in the row.

`BlockPlan` is the didactic grouping of rows. A block is a memory and teaching device, not an ontological parent.

### F.17:6 - When to create or update a UTS row

Create or update a UTS row when at least one condition is present:

- the name will be public, Core-facing, or reused under more than one effective reference scheme;
- a row id is needed for later examples, checks, dashboards, training material, or tool interface labels;
- a role name, status-family name, slot name, relation name, or local concept name is being reused outside the immediate local repair;
- an obtaining F.9 Bridge and a separately warranted affirmative C.2.1 claim are being used for one exact term-row use between different semantic-context projections;
- a name-card decision from `F.18` needs a compact reader-facing term row;
- a direct pattern changes the governed object in a way that changes the name, local sense, bridge, or admissible use.

Do not create a row only because a word was noticed. First recover the kind, relation, slot position, and admissible use under the direct governing pattern.

### F.17:7 - Row schema

Use these columns unless the sheet has a justified specialization.

| Column | Presence condition | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UTSRowId` | yes | Stable row id. It survives relocation of the row between blocks. |
| `Unification thread` | yes | Sheet-local identifier of the bounded naming thread; it is not an ontological locality bearer. |
| `Block` | yes | Didactic block name. It has no subtype force. |
| `Governed value` | yes | Exact value being named, including a kind token when the name is for that token. |
| `Governed value kind` | yes | Exact kind of the governed value; use `U.Kind` when the governed value is itself a kind token. |
| `Direct pattern` | yes | Pattern that governs the underlying object or claim. |
| `Unified Tech name` | yes | Technical name selected under F.5 and F.18. |
| `Unified Plain name` | yes | Plain-language twin selected under F.5 and F.18. |
| `NameCardRef` | yes | Link to the F.18 NameCard that selected or documented the published names. |
| `SenseCellRefs` | yes | References to exact F.17 scheme-based local-sense coordinates. |
| `BridgeRefs` | when the row makes a correspondence claim between different semantic-context projections | Refs to actual F.9 Bridge occurrences only, with their kind-defined symmetry or orientation and exact endpoint editions. Use direction, rule, tolerance, polarity, and reliance do not live in this field. |
| `Row rationale` | yes | One sentence explaining why this row is one term decision. For reuse between different semantic-context projections, name the exact C.2.1 claim and its A.10 or B.3 reliance basis here or in `Notes`. |
| `Admissible use` | yes | What this row may be cited for. A use between different semantic-context projections states the action, direction, correspondence rule, tolerated loss, and affirmative claim ref; it does not imply authorization or occurrence. |
| `Not this use` | yes | The most tempting blocked use or misuse that this row does not permit. |
| `Row edition` | yes | Edition of the row. |
| `Currentness condition` | yes | Which direct-pattern, scheme, sense, name, Bridge, or source change opens row review. |
| `Notes` | optional | Short teaching or homonym warning only. |

For `SenseCellRefs`, cite the exact by-value reference scheme, local expression, and local-sense claim. If the local expression relies on a naming settlement, cite its `NameCardRef`. If the local-sense claim relies on a publication or another episteme, cite a `LocalSenseBasisRelation@Context` with an exact `U.EpistemeRef` and, when needed, the exact publication-unit ref. The retained suffix is a lineage-compatible name, not a context participant. Do not let a source title, file name, carrier, context label, selected structure, or NameCard substitute for the coordinate or its basis relation.

### F.17:8 - Block plan

A UTS is complete only with a declared block plan. Blocks stay few enough for a careful reader to remember and specific enough to make row search easy.

Example block plan for a role, method, work, and status thread:

- Context and governed values.
- Roles and role descriptions.
- Role assignments and performed work.
- Methods, method descriptions, and work plans.
- Status families and status windows.
- Relation, slot, interface, and bridge terms.
- Evidence, assurance, source, and publication terms when those are the governed values.

This example does not define an ontology. It is a didactic grouping. The sheet may use different blocks when the unification thread is about architecture, transformation flows, evaluation characteristics, Part G search packs, or another area.

### F.17:9 - Layouts

F.17 admits two common layouts.

Layout A, scheme-first: keep the left rail fixed and add one exact reference-scheme column per selected interpretation basis. Use this when the reader's comparison concerns local senses under named schemes.

```text
UTSRowId | Unification thread | Block | Governed value | Governed value kind | Direct pattern
Unified Tech name | Unified Plain name | NameCardRef
Reference scheme A | Reference scheme B | Reference scheme C
BridgeRefs | Row rationale | Admissible use | Not this use
Row edition | Currentness condition | Notes
```

Layout B, comparison-column: keep the scheme, local expression, and sense claim inside `SenseCellRefs` and use a smaller set of presentation columns such as tradition, discipline, language, publication family, or project family. These columns are teaching aids; they have interpretation authority only when each cell still resolves to its exact by-value scheme and local-sense claim.

Never mix a scheme column and a discipline or project-family column as if they had the same kind. A `U.ReferenceScheme` is an interpretation basis carried by value; a comparison column is a didactic view.

### F.17:10 - Static conformance rules for a UTS

Use these checks before citing a UTS row outside its local sheet.

| Rule | Check |
| --- | --- |
| UTS-SCR-01 | Every row has row id, unification-thread id, block, governed value, governed value kind, direct pattern, Tech name, Plain name, scheme-based sense-cell refs, row rationale, admissible use, blocked use, row edition, and currentness condition. |
| UTS-SCR-02 | A row names one governed term decision. If the wording hides multiple typed values, split the row or cite the direct pattern that keeps them distinct. |
| UTS-SCR-03 | Every local sense resolves to one exact by-value reference scheme, local expression, and local-sense claim; no context holon is required or inferred. |
| UTS-SCR-04 | A row that proposes use between different semantic-context projections cites an obtaining F.9 Bridge for the exact endpoint cells and editions, then separately cites an affirmative C.2.1 claim for the row's exact use, direction, correspondence rule, and loss tolerance; current reliance follows the exact A.10 or B.3 branch. Apply four probes: same scheme plus same `LocalSenseClaim` plus a different expression routes to designation and no Bridge; same scheme plus a different `LocalSenseClaim` opens the F.9 question and, for a named row use, the separate claim-and-reliance branch; a different scheme opens only the Bridge question and never establishes one; no current correspondence use creates no Bridge or use claim regardless of scheme count. A negative bounded-use claim rejects the exact named row use; a non-passing reliance result stops or narrows the current use according to its exact A.10 or B.3 disposition; neither changes whether the Bridge obtains or how it is identified. |
| UTS-SCR-05 | The Tech and Plain names satisfy F.5 and F.18; spelling or a familiar context label supplies neither local-sense identity nor a Bridge. |
| UTS-SCR-06 | A role row names `U.Role` or a governed role value; it does not treat RoleDescription, RoleAssignment, capability, method, or work as the same value. |
| UTS-SCR-07 | A status row names the status-family or status-window value governed by F.10 or A.19.SPR; it does not create a role. |
| UTS-SCR-08 | Evidence, assurance, source, publication, and description-use rows cite their direct patterns and do not become generic evidence roles. |
| UTS-SCR-09 | Blocks remain didactic. No subtype, part-of, role, status, or priority claim follows from block placement. |
| UTS-SCR-10 | The sheet states the scheme and reader breadth actually tested. A narrow row does not claim universal or corpus-wide reuse. |

Passing the row schema is not the value criterion. A row succeeds only when its intended readers can recover the correct governed value and direct pattern for the declared use and avoid the blocked use. Row count, filled-cell count, label uniformity, block neatness, and stable identifiers are maintenance aids, not evidence that the term decision is useful or semantically adequate.

### F.17:11 - Regression and stability rules

Recheck only the rows affected by the changed object, name, scheme, sense, Bridge, basis, or source.

| Rule | Trigger | Response when triggered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UTS-RSCR-01 | Reference-scheme value, local expression, or local-sense claim changes | Preserve the old coordinate when it is still cited and create or cite the new exact coordinate; do not silently reuse the old address. |
| UTS-RSCR-02 | Direct governing pattern changes the underlying value kind or admissible use | Recheck governed value, governed value kind, direct pattern, admissible use, and blocked use. |
| UTS-RSCR-03 | F.18 changes the selected name or NameCard decision | Recheck Tech name, Plain name, NameCardRef, aliases, coordinate expression, and rationale. |
| UTS-RSCR-04 | F.9 changes a Bridge endpoint or relation-semantic profile, or C.2.1/A.10/B.3 changes the bounded-use claim or reliance basis | Recheck the changed object only: BridgeRefs for endpoint or profile change; row use, rationale, and notes for changed direction, rule, tolerance, polarity, evidence, reliance, or assurance. |
| UTS-RSCR-05 | Row relocation between blocks | Keep the row id stable and state that relocation between blocks has no ontological force. |
| UTS-RSCR-06 | A role, status, evidence, source, publication, or description row is reused under another semantic-context projection or by another reader group | Recheck the direct governing pattern, exact sense coordinate, and any required Bridge before reuse. |

### F.17:12 - Archetypal Grounding - worked cases

#### F.17:12.1 - Role name becomes public across two project contexts

A project has `ReviewerRole@DesignReview` and `ReviewerRole@ExternalAudit`. The local expressions both say "reviewer", but one concerns a system-in-role performing design review work and the other concerns an assurance actor producing an audit report.

The UTS row does not declare one universal reviewer. It either creates two rows or, when one naming use between different semantic-context projections is genuinely needed, cites an obtaining F.9 Bridge plus an affirmative C.2.1 claim that names the use direction, label rule, and tolerated loss. Each row cites the direct role pattern, the RoleDescription when current, and the `F.18` NameCardRef. A.10 or B.3 governs reliance on the use claim; no row or card creates a role assignment or review Work.

#### F.17:12.2 - Status label looks like a role name

A team proposes `BlockedReviewer` as a public label. F.17 does not accept it as a row until the direct patterns are separated. `Reviewer` is a role value; `blocked` is a status-family value or status-window value. The sheet may publish `Reviewer` as a role row and `Blocked` as a status row, with a note that a local UI may render them together. The table does not create a role called "blocked reviewer".

#### F.17:12.3 - Relation and slot names become reusable

An architecture pattern needs public names for `interfaceSlot`, `providedPort`, and `requiredPort`. The UTS row cites `A.6.5` for slot discipline, `A.6.RSIR` when the relation-signature-interface boundary is current, and `F.18` for durable names. The row does not treat a slot name as a component, role, or capability. If a project context uses `port` differently, the UTS row keeps the local sense and bridge explicit.

#### F.17:12.4 - Misleading evidence-role row

A sheet has a row labelled `Evidence role`. F.17 repairs the row by recovering the governed object instead of treating that label as a U-kind. If the claim is that an episteme is being used as evidence for another claim, `A.10`, `B.3`, or `A.2.4` governs the evidence relation. If the claim is that a system performs evidence-producing work, `A.2.1`, `F.6`, and `A.15.1` govern role assignment and performed work. The UTS may publish names for these values; a generic evidence-role row that fuses them is not admitted.

#### F.17:12.4a - Manufacturing batch across material and planning contexts

A furnace team uses `batch` for one physically handled set of shafts that shares a heat-treatment run and traceability basis. A planning dashboard uses `batch` for a grouping of intended PlanItems. Spelling does not make these one governed value. Recover the physical batch under the direct material or production DPF pattern, including its identity and part-whole treatment when the proposed comparison relies on either; recover the planning grouping under A.15.2 and its direct planning relation. Publish separate rows unless an obtaining F.9 Bridge states the exact semantic relation and a separate affirmative C.2.1 claim names the proposed comparison direction, correspondence rule, and tolerated loss with current A.10 or B.3 reliance. A `batch` row cannot turn a PlanItem grouping into a physical holon or make the physical batch a WorkPlan.

#### F.17:12.4b - Clinical discharge wording

A clinical publication proposes one row for `discharge` and `discharge-ready`. First separate the governed values. A patient-state classification uses A.19.SPR plus the clinical DPF pattern for its bearer, state frame, evidence, qualification window, and use. An accountable discharge decision remains a decision relation under its direct pattern. A completed discharge is dated Work under A.15.1. Publish distinct rows and connect them only through relations actually governed in the clinical context. One familiar label does not make state, decision, and Work interchangeable.

#### F.17:12.4c - Demonstrative walkthrough, mantra, and mantra move

These rows publish naming decisions already governed and named in A.22.CGUS. They cover only the admitted CGUS-demonstrative senses of `mantra` and `mantra move`; they define neither the Plain local mantra that recalls one bounded result nor the Plain long mantra that keeps a distant result dependency visible across direct patterns. Ordinary long and local mantras receive no F.17 row. F.17 publishes the bounded terms; it does not govern the demonstrated structures, rows, or Plain attention aids.

`SeminarExpression.FPFPracticalUse.2026-07-11` names the seminar-content episteme; the publication occurrence that makes an edition available and the `.pptx` and extracted Markdown carriers remain separate. The public basis relation instead relies on the current A.22.CGUS pattern episteme and narrows that reliance to the ordinary-use publication unit.

This worked case is cross-scheme because its endpoint `ReferenceScheme` values differ. The obtaining relation and the row's named use are recorded separately:

The Bridge is `Narrower-than` because the seminar sense adds repetition and attentional use. That relation orientation does not grant a use. The separate affirmative claim states the exact SeminarTeaching-to-FPFPublic naming use, rule, and tolerance; the A.10 relation and `RelianceDisposition=pass` support reliance only on that claim. Changing reader evidence may reopen the claim or reliance while leaving the Bridge fixed. Neither the card nor the passing disposition authorizes publication or proves that publication Work occurred.

The seminar deck and its textual extraction establish the teaching problem and observed concept use. They do not establish English lexical suitability by themselves. Current English dictionary evidence supports the repeated-formula and watchword senses of `mantra`, while its Sanskrit analysis as an instrument of thought supplies the attentional rationale. F.18 and reader-use evidence decide whether that English candidate fits this bounded FPF use. This row does not claim that every local pattern mantra is a `DemonstrativeUnfoldingSlice@Context`; a pattern-local formula is interpreted from that pattern's Solution unless a stronger governed value is claimed. This row makes no cross-language sameness claim. If the term is independently published under another semantic-context projection—including the same scheme with a different `LocalSenseClaim` or another scheme—that publication needs its own F.18 NameCard, exact F.17 SenseCell, and naming evidence. Only when a named current use relates the two projections must that use also cite an obtaining F.9 Bridge, a separate affirmative C.2.1 bounded-use claim for its exact action, direction, rule, and tolerance, and the claim's current A.10 or B.3 reliance. Without that use, publication alone adds no Bridge or use claim.

No F.17 row is published for `working product`. The phrase has no single governed value across physical entities, changed states, capabilities, relations, and epistemes. Technical text uses the exact subject-governed result name; ordinary explanation may say `result produced by work`, or `first useful result` when firstness and receiving-use value have been established.

#### F.17:12.4d - Bounded model-use structure public row

This row publishes the already selected A.1.1/F.18 naming decision for the dependent `U.Structure` specialization. It does not make A.1.1 Stable, create a structure individual, or make any relation obtain.

This row makes only `BoundedModelUseStructure` current for public reuse. A.22's separate cross-structure NameCard remains local and pending: without an independently governed obtaining crossing and an exact positive membership basis, F.17 returns no public row for that label.

#### F.17:12.4e - Three bounded-model-use direct relation-kind rows

These rows publish the three already governed A.1.1 relation-kind names used by E.24.UK. Each row publishes a designation only. A.1.1 still decides whether one of those relation occurrences obtains and how it is reidentified. The naming objects and the separately governed local-sense basis occurrences make none of the three A.1.1 relations obtain, and they create no assertion, temporal extent, Work, or structure.

BlockedUse: no coherence occurrence from a label, predicate label, equal spelling, maintenance or evaluation Work, changed carrier, result episteme, evidence, assertion, publication, or structure membership
RowEdition: 2026-07-25
CurrentnessCondition: reopen when A.1.1 changes the participant kinds, five-part predicate-value rule, interpretation branch, permitted loss, participant-determined identity, NameCard, or named Core use

No public F.17 row is returned for `ModelExpressionCoherencePredicate`: that label remains local to A.1.1 and names the five-part criterion ValueKind rather than any of the three relation kinds.

### F.17:12.5 - Bias-Annotation



F.17 blocks table-bias: a row does not make the named object real, global, reusable, equivalent, or authoritative. It also blocks label-bias: the public name is a designation for a governed value, relation, slot, or local concept, not a substitute for the direct pattern, scheme-based local-sense coordinate, Bridge, admissible-use statement, or currentness condition.

### F.17:13.5 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Passing condition |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-F17-1` | The row names the governed value, its exact kind, and the direct governing pattern before naming choices are published. |
| `CC-F17-2` | Every local sense resolves to one exact by-value reference scheme, one local expression, and one local-sense claim. When the endpoint `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projections differ, the row cites an obtaining F.9 Bridge first, then an affirmative C.2.1 claim for the exact row use, direction, rule, and tolerance, plus its current A.10 or B.3 reliance basis. Same projection plus another expression stays a designation question; scheme difference alone proves no Bridge; no current correspondence use creates no Bridge or use claim. A negative bounded-use claim rejects the exact named row use; a non-passing reliance result stops or narrows the current use according to its exact A.10 or B.3 disposition; neither changes whether the Bridge obtains or how it is identified. |
| `CC-F17-3` | Tech and Plain names are selected under naming patterns after the governed value is stable. |
| `CC-F17-4` | Admissible use, blocked use, row edition, and currentness condition are present. |
| `CC-F17-5` | Role, status, evidence, source, publication, description, method, work, relation, slot, interface, and characteristic claims remain under direct patterns. |
| `CC-F17-6` | A scheme-based SenseCell uses `NameCardRef` only for its naming settlement and separately cites every relied-on local-sense basis through `LocalSenseBasisRelation@Context` with exact value-kind and ref-kind pairs; the suffix adds no context participant. |

### F.17:13 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global glossary row | Removes the exact interpretation basis and local-sense claim. | Add the by-value reference scheme, local expression, and local-sense claim to each scheme-based SenseCell. |
| One row for role and status | Fuses work-capable role with a state-family value. | Split into role row and status row; cite `F.10` or `A.19.SPR` for status. |
| Evidence role bucket | Turns evidence use, source use, assurance, and work into one pseudo-kind. | Recover each claim and cite `A.10`, `B.3`, `E.17`, `E.10.D2`, or role-work patterns. |
| Block as ontology | Treats didactic placement as subtype or part-of claim. | Keep block names as memory aids only. |
| Borrowed locality label as Tech name | Imports one tradition's commitments into the unified row. | Recover the governed value and scheme-based local sense; use F.18 and an actual Bridge rationale before selecting the unified name. |
| Row without direct pattern | Lets F.17 govern the object instead of the term-row publication. | Add direct pattern or mark the row not ready for public reuse. |

### F.17:14 - Closure conditions

A UTS row is ready for ordinary reuse only when:

- the governed value and its exact kind are explicit;
- the direct pattern is named;
- Tech and Plain names are selected under `F.5` and `F.18`;
- every local sense resolves to one exact by-value reference scheme, local expression, and local-sense claim;
- each relied-on local-sense basis is separate from its naming settlement and is cited through `LocalSenseBasisRelation@Context`; the retained suffix adds no context participant;
- every row that claims use between different `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projections cites an obtaining F.9 Bridge for the exact endpoint cells, then separately cites an affirmative C.2.1 claim for the row's action, direction, rule, and tolerance with current A.10 or B.3 reliance; same-projection designation and no-current-correspondence-use cases add no Bridge or use claim, while scheme difference alone opens only the Bridge question;
- the row names admissible use and blocked use;
- currentness conditions are stated;
- any role, status, evidence, source, publication, description, method, work, relation, slot, interface, or characteristic claim remains under its direct pattern.

### F.17:14.1 - Consequences

**Benefits.** A UTS row gives readers a stable place to recover a term decision without treating a table as an ontology. It supports public reuse, examples, training material, interface labels, and comparison across different semantic-context projections while preserving exact local-sense claims and direct-pattern authority.

**Costs.** A tempting public label may wait until the governed value, effective scheme, exact local-sense claim, any needed Bridge, separate bounded-use claim and reliance basis, naming settlement, and currentness condition are settled.

**Failure avoided.** F.17 prevents global glossary drift, row-shaped ontology claims, block-as-subtype mistakes, label-based sameness, and evidence or role authority smuggled through a public term.

### F.17:14.2 - Rationale

Terms travel farther than the reasoning that produced them. F.17 keeps that travel safe by carrying the minimum reopening hooks: governed object, direct pattern, local senses, obtaining Bridge when needed, separate bounded-use claim and reliance basis, names, admitted and blocked row use, and currentness. The row stays compact because F.9, C.2.1, A.10, B.3, and the direct subject patterns still own those objects.

### F.17:16 - SoTA-Echoing

| Current source and status | Adopted or adapted move | Effect in F.17 | Limitation and reopen condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current FPF naming and unification set, amended 2026-07-25: `F.18`, `F.9`, `F.15`, `F.10`, `E.10`, A.1.1, and the direct subject patterns | Start from a governed value and kind; carry the effective reference scheme by value; select names through a NameCard; for reuse between different `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projections cite an obtaining F.9 Bridge, then an affirmative C.2.1 claim for the exact row use and its A.10 or B.3 reliance basis; keep static and regression checks local; separate status and role claims. | Determines the Solution, mandatory NameCardRef, value-kind pair, scheme-based SenseCellRefs, relation-only BridgeRefs, admitted and blocked row use, stable row id, local regressions, and direct-pattern boundary. Adds the current `BoundedModelUseStructure` row without creating `U.BoundedContext` or a positive crossing-structure name. | This is the current governing basis, not external proof that a proposed row works for readers. Reopen the affected row when one of these patterns changes its kind settlement, reference scheme, naming decision, Bridge, bounded-use claim, reliance, status boundary, or regression rule. |
| Zhu, Reinecke, and Mitra, ["Language Scent: Exploring Cross-Language Information Navigation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.03604), arXiv:2604.03604, 2026 preprint | Treat recognizability of a label as scheme- and situation-sensitive navigation support rather than evidence of equivalence. Preserve in-situ cues while keeping their governed value and sense boundary recoverable. | Changes the local-sense, reader-use, and blocked-substitution checks for Plain names such as `mantra`; supports contextual labels and explicit F.9 Bridges rather than one global label. | The study is small and cross-language. It neither establishes FPF ontology nor proves one label works under every scheme or for every reader. Reopen when stronger reader evidence changes the observed cue value or loss. |
| W3C, [*SKOS Simple Knowledge Organization System Reference*](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/), W3C Recommendation 2009, current stable reference accessed 2026-07-11 | Keep concepts, lexical labels, documentation notes, collections, and typed mapping relations distinct; do not infer transitivity or equivalence from a generic related or matching label. | Supplies a stable external reference for separating labels, notes, collections, and mappings. F.17 strengthens it with direct FPF value kinds, relation-only F.9 Bridges, separate action-specific C.2.1 claims, NameCards, admitted and blocked row use, and currentness. | SKOS is a stable web vocabulary model, not current best-known FPF authoring methodology and not a source of FPF kinds. Reopen this adaptation if W3C supersedes the Recommendation or a newer mapping practice changes the selected distinction. |

The current best problem-solving line for F.17 is the current FPF value, reference-scheme, naming, Bridge, status, and regression architecture. The 2026 language-scent study changes contextual cue handling subject to its evidence limits. SKOS remains a stable reference model for label and mapping separation; its age and stability do not make it the method that governs FPF term decisions.

Currentness rule: when `F.5`, `F.8`, `F.9`, `F.10`, `F.15`, `F.18`, `A.1.1`, `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.7`, `A.6.5`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `E.17`, or `E.10.D2` changes the governed value, effective reference scheme, local-sense claim, Bridge, bounded-use claim, reliance basis, source-use boundary, status-family boundary, role boundary, or naming decision, recheck only the affected UTS rows and examples.

### F.17:15 - Relations

Builds on: `F.2` and `F.3` for local-sense discovery probes; `C.2.1` for the exact episteme and effective by-value reference scheme; and `F.5`, `F.7`, `F.8`, `F.9`, `F.15`, and `F.18` for naming, Bridge, and conformance decisions. F.17 does not inherit F.3's retired `U.BoundedContext` reading.

Coordinates with: `A.2`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.7`, `A.6.5`, `A.6.P`, `A.10`, `A.15.1`, `A.19.SPR`, `B.3`, `C.2.P`, `E.10`, `E.10.D2`, `E.17`, `F.4`, `F.6`, `F.10`, `F.14`, and `G.11`. Row-local review after a changed value, name, sense, Bridge, or edition remains with the direct pattern, F.18, F.9, F.15, and these F.17 regression rules. Use G.11 only when an actual refresh plan, edition orchestration, telemetry, freshness, or decay claim is current.

Constrains: any public, Core-facing, durable, or cross-context term sheet row that cites FPF vocabulary, local concepts, relation names, slot names, role names, status names, or bridgeable sense clusters.

### F.17:17 - Didactic distillation

A Unified Term Sheet is not the ontology and not the object. It lets people reuse a naming decision without guessing. Each row says what is named, which pattern governs it, which local senses were used, whether an exact Bridge obtains between different semantic-context projections, which separate claim supports that row use, which names were selected, and what the row may and may not be cited for. The row, card, and reliance record neither authorize the use nor prove that it happened.
