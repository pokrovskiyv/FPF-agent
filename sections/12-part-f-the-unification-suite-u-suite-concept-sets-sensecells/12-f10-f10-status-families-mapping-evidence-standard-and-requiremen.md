## F.10 - Status Families Mapping: Evidence, Standard, and Requirement Status

> **Type:** Boundary and relation-use pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

### F.10:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when a project uses status words such as "observed", "measured", "validated", "approved", "deprecated", "satisfied", "violated", "waived", "pending", "current", or "ready" and needs to know what kind of status is being claimed, what it qualifies, and whether it can be compared or reused in another bounded context.

Use it especially when evidence, standards, and requirements are being mixed: a dashboard says a service is ready, a standard says a method is approved, a measurement says a requirement is satisfied, a model card says a model is validated, or a requirement register says a clause is waived.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** The primary `EntityOfConcern` is the status-use statement and the status-family mapping that make one status value usable in one bounded context. The pattern governs the relation among status cell, target, target kind, scope, window, source or provenance constraint, and intended status use. It does not make an episteme hold a role and does not treat a visible status display as gate passage, permission, assurance, evidence, or performed work by itself.

**First useful move.** Write the smallest status-use statement: status family, bounded context, status value, target, target kind, scope, window when current, source or provenance constraint, intended use, and stronger use not carried by this relation.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A single word such as "validated" starts doing the work of evidence, standard approval, requirement satisfaction, gate passage, release readiness, and assurance at once. Cross-context dashboards compare labels without bridge loss. A report or standard is treated as if it had a status role. A design-time approval is read as run-time compliance.

**What this buys.** Status words stay local, typed, and comparable. Evidence status says what has evidential standing for a claim. Standard status says what a canon or standard-governed context sanctions. Requirement status says what is happening to an obligation or clause. Cross-context movement becomes an explicit bridge claim instead of a synonym guess.

**Not this pattern when.** If the current claim is full evidence provenance, use `A.10`. If the current claim is only an episteme being used as evidence or status before full status-family mapping is needed, use `A.2.4`. If the current claim is assurance, use `B.3`. If the current claim is causal use, use `C.28`. If the current claim is a source, publication face, view, explanation, or specification-use question, use `E.17`, `E.17.0`, `E.17.2`, `E.17.EFP`, `E.10.D2`, or the direct publication-use pattern. If the current claim is a system or acting holon holding a work-facing role, use `A.2` and `A.2.1`. If the current claim is performed work, use `A.15.1`.

### F.10:2 - Problem

Status vocabulary is useful because it is compact. It is dangerous because the same compact label often hides several different claims.

The common failures are:

1. **Modality collapse.** "Validated" is read as evidence, standard approval, requirement satisfaction, and release permission at once.
2. **Target collapse.** A status is asserted without saying whether it qualifies a claim, quantity, method description, standard text, requirement clause, work result, role assignment, publication, gate record, or another exact target.
3. **Window loss.** Positive or negative status is asserted without the time, edition, condition, or relevance window that makes contradiction and freshness checkable.
4. **Context leakage.** A status word from one context is reused in another as if the label itself carried equivalence.
5. **Episteme role drift.** A report, standard, dashboard cell, model card, or requirement document is described as having an "evidence role", "status role", or "standard role" instead of being used in an evidence-use, status-use, source-use, standard-use, or requirement-use relation.
6. **Design-run substitution.** A design-time standard approval is read as run-time evidence, or run-time evidence is read as standard approval, without an interpretation bridge and an evaluation rule.
7. **Display overread.** A badge, traffic-light cell, dashboard tile, register excerpt, screenshot, certificate view, or generated summary is treated as the status source, gate decision, or assurance result without recoverable source relation.

### F.10:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension this pattern resolves |
| --- | --- |
| Local fidelity versus reuse | Every status value belongs to one bounded context, but projects need to compare and reuse statuses across contexts. |
| Compact label versus typed relation | Status labels must stay quick to read, while the target, scope, window, source, and intended use must remain recoverable when reliance depends on them. |
| Evidence versus standard versus requirement | Evidence status is epistemic; standard and requirement statuses are deontic in different ways. Treating them as synonyms breaks reasoning. |
| Design-time stance versus run-time standing | Standards usually govern design or method choice; evidence usually comes from observed or measured work; requirements span both. |
| Display cue versus source relation | Status displays help humans find a source, but the display is not automatically the source, decision, permission, or assurance. |
| Ordinary speech versus FPF kind discipline | People say "the role of this status" or "the standard's role"; FPF recovers status-use, standard-use, requirement-use, or evidence-use relations instead of making epistemes role holders. |

### F.10:4 - Solution

Treat a status claim as a context-local status-use statement, not as a free-floating adjective and not as a role assignment.

#### F.10:4.1 - Three Status Families

F.10 uses three status families as a small spine for common project work:

| Status family | Status modality | Typical target kind | What it says |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EvidenceStatus` | epistemic | claim, quantity, observation-backed claim, effect claim, model-result claim | What the available evidence says for or against a target claim in the current context and window. |
| `StandardStatus` | deontic, curatorial | method description, standard text, profile, governed product configuration, standard-governed project entity | What a canon, standard, profile, or governing register sanctions, discourages, or supersedes in the current context and edition. |
| `RequirementStatus` | deontic, compliance-facing | requirement clause, duty clause, constraint clause, acceptance criterion, obligation claim | Whether a clause applies, is satisfied, is violated, is waived, is pending, or does not bind under stated conditions. |

A project may add local sublevels or local labels, but the local label must map to one of these families or to another direct status pattern named by value. Do not create a new role kind merely because a status word is local.

#### F.10:4.2 - StatusCell and StatusUseStatement

A `StatusCell` is a context-local sense cell for a status value. It has a status family, status modality, typical target kind, polarity, and window discipline. A `StatusCell` is a meaning cell, not a work performer and not a gate decision.

A `StatusUseStatement` applies one status cell or local status value to a target in a bounded context:

```text
StatusUseStatement:
  BoundedContext:
  StatusFamily:
  StatusCellOrLocalValue:
  StatusModality:
  StatusTarget:
  StatusTargetKind:
  StatusScope:
  StatusPolarity:
  StatusWindow:
  StatusSourceOrProvenanceConstraint:
  StatusUse:
  BridgeRef:
  NotCarried:
```

`StatusTargetKind` decides relation identity. A status that qualifies a method description is not the same status-use statement as a status that qualifies a requirement clause, even when the visible label is the same. `NotCarried` names the stronger use that this status statement does not carry, such as gate passage, release permission, assurance, performed work, causal identification, global truth, or cross-context substitution.

#### F.10:4.3 - Relation Slots for Status Use

Use the A.2.4 status-use slots when a status statement must be precise enough for reliance:

| SlotKind | ValueKind | Currentness discipline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `StatusBearerSlot` | episteme, claim, method description, publication, role assignment, work occurrence, clause, gate record, or another bearer admitted by the direct pattern | Names the value whose status is being asserted or read. It does not make the bearer a role holder. |
| `StatusTargetSlot` | claim, method, episteme, publication, work result, clause, bearer, or another governed target | Required when the status is not simply about the bearer itself. |
| `StatusScopeSlot` | bounded-context scope, claim scope, admission scope, requirement scope, or use scope | Currentness-required when scope changes the status assertion. |
| `StatusValueSlot` | status value governed by F.10 or a direct status pattern | Required for any status assertion. |
| `StatusWindowSlot` | temporal validity window, freshness policy, edition window, status-currentness relation, or source-currentness relation | Currentness-required for time-sensitive or edition-sensitive status. |
| `StatusUseSlot` | gate use, assurance use, admission use, source-currentness use, work-plan readiness use, requirement evaluation use, standard-use, or another direct use | Required when the status is consumed for that use. |
| `StatusProvenanceConstraintSlot` | source order, authority source, publication, proof, verification, register, or provenance constraint | Currentness-required when provenance decides status use. |

These SlotKinds are relation positions. They are not `U.Role` names, not work-role qualifier slots, and not a new generic status ontic by themselves.

#### F.10:4.4 - Family Spines

The following spines are deliberately small. They help contexts map local status words without pretending that every domain has the same status vocabulary.

**EvidenceStatus** values:

1. `Observed` - seen or recorded once under declared observation conditions.
2. `Measured` - quantified under a declared measurement procedure.
3. `Corroborated` - backed by more than one independent source, procedure, or observation line.
4. `Replicated` - repeated by others or under varied declared conditions.
5. `Refuted` - counter-evidence defeats the positive standing inside the same window.
6. `Inconclusive` - the available evidence is insufficient or mixed for the target claim.

**StandardStatus** values:

1. `Candidate` - proposed and not yet normative in the context.
2. `Draft` - worked text or profile, not yet the governing edition.
3. `Approved` - normative in this context and edition.
4. `Deprecated` - discouraged, allowed only under stated conditions, or being phased out.
5. `Superseded` - replaced by a newer edition, profile, or governing source.

**RequirementStatus** values:

1. `Applicable` - the clause binds in the stated context and window.
2. `Inapplicable` - the clause does not bind under stated conditions.
3. `Satisfied` - met within the stated context and window.
4. `Violated` - not met within the stated context and window.
5. `Waived` - binding is suspended or exceptioned by a named source and window.
6. `Pending` - awaiting evidence, evaluation, decision, or source-currentness repair.

#### F.10:4.5 - Bridge Discipline

Status meanings do not travel by label. A cross-context comparison, explanation, or substitution uses an `F.9` bridge with direction, bridge kind, congruence level, and loss notes.

Explanation is the ordinary cross-context use. Substitution is admitted only when the bridge kind, congruence level, window alignment, target kind, and local evaluation rule all admit the substitution. Cross-modality movement, such as evidence status being used to evaluate requirement status, is an interpretation relation; it is not equivalence.

#### F.10:4.6 - Design-Run Discipline

Keep three questions separate:

* What does the evidence show about a claim or measured quantity in this window?
* What does the standard or canon sanction for a method description, profile, or governed project entity in this edition?
* What is the requirement clause doing in this context and window?

A standard-approved method description can be a source for method selection or a condition for allowed use. It does not by itself show that a run-time clause is satisfied. Run-time evidence can help evaluate a requirement clause. It does not by itself approve the method or standard profile unless a governing context has a rule for that promotion.

### F.10:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### F.10:5.1 - Service Acceptance from Run-Time Evidence

A service dashboard reports uptime for July. In the monitoring context, the measurement episteme gives `EvidenceStatus = Measured` for the claim "uptime was 99.95 percent in July." In the service-management context, the SLO clause has `RequirementStatus = Satisfied` only if the service pattern's evaluation rule says that the measured uptime meets the clause.

F.10 records two status-use statements and an interpretation bridge. It does not infer requirement satisfaction from the word "measured" alone.

#### F.10:5.2 - Approved Method Description

A safety controller method description is `StandardStatus = Approved` in one standard profile and edition. That approval makes the method description admissible under that profile. It does not prove that a particular controller run met response-time obligations. A run-time log can be assigned `EvidenceStatus = Corroborated` for a response-time claim; a separate requirement-use statement can then evaluate the duty clause.

#### F.10:5.3 - Model Card and Fairness Requirement

A model card says a model is "validated" because cross-validation AUC is high. In F.10 this becomes an `EvidenceStatus` statement for a predictive-performance claim inside the validation context. It does not decide the policy requirement "demographic parity delta <= 0.1" unless production-window fairness evidence and the policy evaluation rule are present.

#### F.10:5.4 - Status Display Cue

A release dashboard cell shows `Ready`. The cell is a cue. A status-use statement is available only when the source, target, value, scope, window, and provenance constraint are recoverable. If the status is consumed for a gate, release, assurance, or admission use, the direct governing pattern for that use must also admit it.

### F.10:6 - Bias-Annotation

F.10 is vulnerable to three recurring biases.

* **Label authority bias.** A familiar status word is treated as source authority. Repair by recovering status target, source, window, and intended use.
* **Semio-bias.** A visible display, publication face, badge, or label becomes the center of the pattern. Repair by making the status-use relation the `EntityOfConcern`; display and publication questions go to `E.17`, `A.10`, or `E.10.D2`.
* **Role drift.** A standard, report, dashboard, or requirement is described as having a role. Repair by using status-use, standard-use, requirement-use, evidence-use, or source-use relations; reserve `U.Role` and `U.RoleAssignment` for work-facing holders.

### F.10:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Question |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-F10-01` Status family | Is the status value mapped to `EvidenceStatus`, `StandardStatus`, `RequirementStatus`, or another direct status pattern named by value? |
| `CC-F10-02` Context | Is the bounded context or edition that gives the status value meaning named? |
| `CC-F10-03` Target kind | Does the statement name the exact target kind: claim, quantity, method description, standard-governed entity, requirement clause, gate record, role assignment, work result, publication, or another direct-pattern target? |
| `CC-F10-04` Window | Does every positive or negative status name the window, edition, condition, freshness policy, or source-currentness relation that bounds it when current? |
| `CC-F10-05` Source and provenance | Is the status source, governing register, publication source, proof, measurement, verification, or provenance constraint recoverable when the use depends on it? |
| `CC-F10-06` Modality | Is epistemic status kept distinct from deontic standard or requirement status? |
| `CC-F10-07` Bridge | Does any cross-context comparison, explanation, or substitution cite an `F.9` bridge with kind, direction, congruence level, and loss? |
| `CC-F10-08` Substitution | If one status is substituted for another, do bridge kind, congruence level, window alignment, target kind, and local evaluation rule admit that substitution? |
| `CC-F10-09` No role ontology drift | Is there no claim that an episteme holds an evidence role, status role, standard role, or requirement role merely because it is used? |
| `CC-F10-10` Direct-pattern boundary | Are evidence provenance, assurance, causal use, source use, publication use, gate passage, permission, performed work, and work-role assignment governed by their direct patterns when those claims are current? |

### F.10:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Failure | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Validated -> approved -> compliant` | One label carries evidence, standard, and requirement status at once. | Split into evidence, standard, and requirement status-use statements; add bridge and evaluation rule only where admitted. |
| Approved method means SLO satisfied | Design-time standard status is used as run-time requirement status. | Keep method-description approval separate from run-time evidence and clause evaluation. |
| Status badge as gate passage | A display cue is treated as source, decision, and permission. | Recover source relation, target, window, and direct gate or release pattern. |
| Clause-less compliance | "Compliant" is asserted without a requirement clause. | Name the clause or acceptance criterion and the window. |
| Bridge-free roll-up | Cross-context dashboard aggregates labels as if meanings were native. | Add F.9 bridges with loss notes or downgrade to local explanation. |
| Evidence escalation without independence | One repeated lab result is called replicated. | Keep it measured or corroborated unless independent replication conditions are named. |
| Status role for episteme | A report, standard, or requirement is said to hold a role. | Use A.2.4 status-use or evidence-use relation slots and F.10 status-family mapping. |
| Tool-state explosion | Every local tool state becomes a new status kind. | Map local labels to the nearest context-local status cell; keep tool labels as local names when no durable family is needed. |

### F.10:9 - Consequences

F.10 adds a small amount of relation work before a status claim can be relied on. That cost is intentional: the user names context, target kind, window, source, and use instead of letting one status word decide everything.

The payoff is practical. Teams can compare statuses across disciplines, explain why a status was accepted or rejected, see where bridge loss enters, and stop a status display from becoming permission, assurance, or performed-work evidence by accident.

The main limitation is that F.10 does not decide the downstream claim. It does not compute assurance, pass a gate, authorize work, prove causal effect, perform source-currentness repair, or evaluate a requirement clause by itself. It supplies the status-family and status-use relation that the direct pattern may consume.

Open the direct governing pattern when the attempted use depends on evidence provenance, assurance level, gate decision, permission, performed work, causal identification, source freshness, publication interpretation, standard authority, requirement evaluation, or contested source order.

### F.10:10 - Rationale

Status words sit at the meeting point of evidence, norms, and action. That makes them tempting shortcuts. A shortcut is safe only when the status target and intended use remain visible.

F.10 keeps the shortcut by using a small family spine, but it prevents ontology drift by making the status-use statement explicit. A status value is not a role. A status display is not the status source by itself. A standard approval is not run-time satisfaction. Evidence status can explain requirement status only through an interpretation relation and an evaluation rule.

This keeps Part F naming and bridge machinery useful while letting A.10, B.3, C.28, E.17, A.2, A.15, and gate or requirement patterns govern their own stronger claims.

### F.10:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Practice pressure | F.10 adoption | Practical implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements engineering and compliance practice separates clauses, applicability, satisfaction, waiver, and evidence of satisfaction. | RequirementStatus targets clauses or obligation claims, with window and source discipline. | "Compliant" without a clause and window is not a usable requirement status. |
| Standards and profile governance separates candidate, draft, approved, deprecated, and superseded editions. | StandardStatus is edition- and context-bound. | An approved method description or standard profile does not by itself prove a run-time claim. |
| Evidence and provenance practice separates observation, measurement, corroboration, replication, refutation, source, and confidence. | EvidenceStatus qualifies target claims and remains consumable by A.10 and B.3. | A badge, citation, metric, or dashboard tile must expose source relation before stronger reliance. |
| Cross-context terminology practice uses bridges rather than global synonyms. | F.9 bridge kind, direction, congruence level, and loss govern cross-context status comparison. | Cross-context dashboards can explain status differences without silently equating labels. |
| Digital credential, register, and dashboard practice separates visible status views from issuer, verifier, subject binding, revocation, currentness, and relying context. | Status display is a cue; status-use statement needs source and provenance constraints when relied on. | A green cell or credential view is not gate passage, role assignment, permission, or assurance by itself. |

### F.10:12 - Relations

**Builds on:** `A.2.4` for evidence-use and status-use relation slots; `F.1` through `F.3` for context, seed, and local-sense discipline; `F.9` for bridges across contexts; `F.18` for local-first naming discipline.

**Coordinates with:**

* `A.10` when a status claim depends on evidence provenance, evidence source, source-currentness, or evidence-producing work.
* `B.3` when a status is consumed as assurance input.
* `C.2.1` when the identity of the episteme, claim graph, reference scheme, or grounding holon matters.
* `C.28` when the status is causal, counterfactual, intervention-facing, or simulation-output-facing.
* `E.17`, `E.17.0`, `E.17.2`, `E.17.EFP`, and `E.10.D2` when a publication face, view, explanation, source, description, or specification-use question is current.
* `A.2`, `A.2.1`, and `A.15` when a system or acting holon holds a work-facing role or performs work.
* Gate, release, standard-use, requirement-use, decision, and source-currentness patterns when status is consumed for those stronger uses.

* **Precision-restoration owners:** When source wording says "status role", "approved role", "standard role", "validated means compliant", "green means ready", or another status-shaped phrase hides target kind, status family, window, bridge, source, or direct-pattern use, use `A.6.RSIR` for relation-slot or role-like slot recovery and `E.10.ARCH` for ontology-first repair architecture.

### F.10:End
