## F.9 - Alignment and Bridge across Contexts
> **Type:** Pattern
> **Status:** Stable

**"Translate across contexts; never collapse them."**

**Type:** Architectural pattern.
**Status:** Stable.
**Normativity:** Normative.
**Builds on:** F.17 for exact scheme-based `SchemeSenseCell` identity and `SenseCellAddressRef`; F.18 for designation selection; C.2.1 for assertion and description-episteme identity; F.0.1 for `senseFamily` and bridge-only crossing discipline; F.7 and F.8 for downstream naming and reuse decisions.

**Coordinates with:** A.10 for evidence-provenance relations and local reliance dispositions; B.3 for assurance claims and minimum assurance records; A.2, A.2.1, F.4, F.5, F.6, and A.15.1 for work-facing role and performed-work claims; A.6.5 for relation-slot discipline; C.29 for mathematical-lens use; A.6.3.CSC for controlled coarsening; C.26.1 and C.26.2 for quantum-like export boundaries.

**Plain entry cues (informative).** Context-to-context translator; sense bridge.

### F.9:1 - Intent and applicability

**Intent.** Govern one actual semantic `Bridge` relation between two exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values from different semantic contexts. Keep that relation separate from a claim that it suits a proposed use, the evidence or assurance on which a reader relies, an optional Bridge Card, and any object created when the proposed use is actually performed.

**Applicability.** Use this pattern when an author needs to compare local senses across contexts, reuse a familiar label, connect design-time and run-time senses, compare two standards' terms, or justify a cross-context row. A shared word or available mapping is only a reason to ask whether a Bridge obtains.

**Primary EntityOfConcern in plain terms.** One actual correspondence or difference between two exact local senses. The governed object is the direct `Bridge` occurrence, not a card, context, transport chain, work process, role assignment, evidence item, or global meaning layer.

**Admissible move in plain terms.** First resolve the two local senses. Then state what semantic correspondence or difference holds between them and test that relation. If it obtains, identify the Bridge. Only after that, state the proposed use separately: what the reader will do, in which direction, by which correspondence rule, and how much semantic loss that use tolerates. A current affirmative C.2.1 claim answers whether this Bridge is suitable for that bounded use. Check the evidence for relying on that claim under A.10, or use B.3 when an assurance claim is made or its material-reliance threshold is met. If the use actually happened, recover the resulting Work, assertion, publication, relation, operation application, or other object under its direct owner. Add a Bridge Card only when a reusable package is worth maintaining.

**Primary working reader.** An author, checker, or practitioner deciding first whether a cross-local semantic relation actually obtains and then whether it supports one named use.

**Use this when.** Use F.9 when a receiving claim needs an exact semantic relation between two local senses whose `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` interpretation bases differ. Different schemes, identical spelling, a mapping implementation, or a request for comparison does not establish that relation.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Teams turn shared labels and convenient mappings into silent equivalence, substitution, structural inference, status transfer, or role assignment. They also mistake evidence about a proposed use, or a polished card, for the relation itself.

**What this buys.** A reader can see which relation is true, which proposed use is being judged, what evidence supports reliance on that judgement, and whether any downstream act actually happened. Those facts can change independently without silently merging local meanings.

**Not this pattern when.** Not F.9 when the case is still inside one semantic context, or when the live question is role assignment, performed-work attribution, evidence use, status use, source use, publication, assurance, authorization, a gate, a decision, or a mathematical-lens operation. Use the direct governing pattern for that object; cite F.9 only when cross-context semantic correspondence is also needed.

**Recognition versus assurance note.** Resolving the endpoint senses and testing the direct Bridge predicate recognizes the semantic relation. A separate C.2.1 claim judges one bounded use. A.10 or B.3 governs whether a reader may rely on that claim for the named use. None of those steps supplies legal, policy, or deontic authorization.

### F.9:2 - Problem frame

Cross-context work fails in predictable ways:

1. **String-equals fallacy.** Identical spellings such as "process", "role", "accuracy", or "ready" are taken as identical meaning.
2. **Relation-to-use jump.** A true semantic correspondence is treated as sufficient for whatever comparison, substitution, translation, or publication is wanted next.
3. **Design-run jumping.** Design artefacts are substituted for run-time occurrences, or run-time occurrences are treated as design definitions.
4. **Direction amnesia.** A symmetric relation is read as two use licences, or narrower and broader senses are used in the unsafe direction.
5. **Loss blindness.** The proposed use does not name which differences it tolerates.
6. **Evidence and permission collapse.** A score, card, or assurance record is treated as the semantic relation, authorization, or proof that the use occurred.

F.9 answers these failures by separating the direct relation, the bounded-use proposition, reliance on that proposition, optional packaging, authorization, and any actual receiving object.

### F.9:2.1 - Problem

A shared label across contexts can look like identity or permission before any semantic relation is tested. Even after a Bridge obtains, its truth does not answer whether one particular comparison or substitution is suitable. The problem is to preserve useful cross-context work while keeping the relation, the proposed use, its evidence, and the downstream act individually testable.

### F.9:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension to resolve |
| --- | --- |
| Locality versus reuse | Senses are context-local, yet people need common labels and comparison points across contexts. |
| Simplicity versus fidelity | Few Bridge kinds are teachable; too few hide material semantic differences. |
| Relation truth versus practical use | A correspondence can obtain while a proposed direction, rule, or tolerance is unsuitable. |
| `senseFamily` continuity versus explanation | Some relations compare senses within one family; others explain a cross-family connection without making them substitutable. |
| Evidence versus authorization | Evidence or assurance may support reliance on a bounded-use claim but does not grant legal, policy, or deontic permission. |
| Bridge discipline versus direct governing patterns | F.9 governs semantic correspondence; it must not create role assignments, work, evidence relations, publications, or status occurrences. |

### F.9:4 - Solution

Start with the two exact local senses, not with a context object, mapping table, or card. Resolve each endpoint as an F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` coordinate:

```text
<ReferenceScheme by value, LocalExpression, LocalSenseClaim>
```

For F.9, **semantic context** is Plain shorthand for the bounded interpretation basis recovered from one cell's `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projection. It is not a `U.Entity`, `U.BoundedContext`, selected model-use structure, project, scope, viewpoint, description, designator, or reference. Two expressions under the same projection are a designation question first. Different projections make a Bridge question possible but do not make a Bridge obtain.

When the two cells are from different semantic contexts, declare one relation-semantic `BridgePredicateProfile` and test it against their current meanings. Shared spelling, different schemes, a mapping implementation, a card, a registry entry, evidence, an assessment score, or publication establishes none of those facts by itself.

#### F.9:4.1 - Direct Bridge relation

`Bridge` is a direct species of `U.Relation`. Its reusable `RelationSignature` has exactly two participant meanings:

| SlotKind | ValueKind | refMode | Participant meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SourceSenseCellSlot` | F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` coordinate | `SenseCellAddressRef` | The exact source local sense, resolving its by-value reference scheme, local expression, and local-sense claim. |
| `ReceivingSenseCellSlot` | F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` coordinate | `SenseCellAddressRef` | The exact receiving local sense used by the claimed semantic relation. |

No context, proposed use, use direction, correspondence rule for that use, permitted-loss tolerance, assertion, evidence item, policy, time value, card, publication, registry id, or carrier is a third participant.

An F.9-local `BridgePredicateProfile` is a by-value predicate declaration, not a U-kind, participant, card, claim, or evaluation result. Its identity-bearing content is only:

1. the `BridgeKind` and its kind-defined symmetry or endpoint orientation;
2. the exact source and receiving endpoint-sense readings, including their `senseFamily` readings where material;
3. the relation-kind-specific correspondence or difference condition;
4. the applicability and as-of basis for testing that condition;
5. the Boolean truth condition; and
6. every stop dependency whose absence prevents a truthful result.

The profile contains no receiving-use role, use direction, use-specific correspondence rule, permitted-loss tolerance, bounded-use proposition, assertion polarity, evidence-reliance classification, assurance claim, authorization, or receiving object.

`Bridge(SourceSenseCell, ReceivingSenseCell; BridgePredicateProfile)` obtains exactly when:

- both endpoint references resolve to exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values;
- their semantic-context projections differ;
- the profile applies to those endpoint readings at its stated as-of basis;
- the current endpoint meanings satisfy its kind-specific correspondence or difference condition and Boolean truth condition; and
- every required dependency is present.

If an endpoint is unresolved, the projections are the same, a dependency is missing, or the predicate is false or unresolved, assert no positive occurrence and state the exact exit: ordinary designation, `unresolved SenseCell endpoint`, `same semantic context`, `missing Bridge dependency`, `Bridge predicate false`, or `Bridge predicate unresolved`.

The occurrence is identified by the exact endpoint cells together with the exact profile. For an asymmetric kind, the ordered source-to-receiving relation tuple is identity-bearing and an inverse claim requires another profile and occurrence. For a symmetric kind, swapping only the readable presentation of the same canonical endpoint pair does not create another occurrence. A changed endpoint or changed relation-semantic profile identifies another occurrence candidate. A changed proposed use, use direction, rule, tolerance, evidence path, reliance disposition, assurance claim, card, registry entry, publication, form, or carrier does not reidentify the fixed Bridge.

#### F.9:4.2 - Judge a bounded use separately

Once exact Bridge `b` obtains, state the proposed use in ordinary language before introducing FPF terms. Name:

- `u`: what the reader proposes to compare, substitute, translate, publish, or otherwise do;
- `d`: the exact source-to-receiving direction for that use;
- `r`: the use-specific correspondence rule;
- `t`: the semantic-loss tolerance for that use; and
- whether the claim is affirmative or negative.

The resulting C.2.1 claim asks whether `b` is suitable for `<u,d,r,t>`. Its exact EntityOfConcern is `b`; its ClaimGraph designates `u`, `d`, `r`, `t`, and polarity; its effective ReferenceScheme makes those designations interpretable. That C.2.1 triple identifies the claim episteme. Changing `u`, `d`, `r`, or `t` changes the claim, not the Bridge.

An affirmative claim is one premise for the proposed use. It is not a permission, authorization, evidence-provenance relation, reliance classification, assurance claim, decision, or occurrence of that use. A negative claim says that the Bridge is not suitable for the named use; it does not make the Bridge cease to obtain.

For ordinary evidence reliance below B.3's material-reliance threshold and with no assurance claim, recover the exact A.10 evidence-provenance graph relation by value and state its local `RelianceDisposition` for the same bounded use. Only `RelianceDisposition=pass` supports reliance on the affirmative claim for that exact use; `degrade` supports only its named narrower use, while `abstain`, `reopen`, `evidence-needed`, `blocked-current-use`, or `safety-case-required` supplies no passing classification for the attempted use.

Enter B.3 when the receiver makes an assurance claim or the proposed use meets B.3's material-reliance threshold. Decide first whether a current assurance claim exists. A met threshold requires the minimum reliance safety assurance record and contest boundary but creates no positive claim. Use a positive current B.3 assurance claim only when it exists, its record is sufficient, and it carries the same bounded assurance use. Otherwise state the exact no-assurance, insufficient-record, narrowed, rejected, withdrawn, abstaining, or blocked disposition and stop or narrow the use accordingly.

Neither an A.10 passing disposition nor a positive B.3 assurance claim is legal, policy, or deontic authorization. If authorization is needed, recover it under its direct governor. If a later claim says the use happened, recover the actual Work, assertion episteme, publication occurrence, direct relation, operation application, or other object under its own pattern; the role `u` in the bounded-use claim is not that occurrence.

### F.9:5 - Minimal vocabulary

* **Semantic context** - Plain shorthand for the interpretation basis `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` recovered from an exact F.17 cell; it is not a separate entity or participant.
* **SchemeSenseCell** - the exact F.17 local composite value `<ReferenceScheme by value, LocalExpression, LocalSenseClaim>`.
* **SenseCellAddressRef** - an address that resolves one exact `SchemeSenseCell`; the address is not the cell.
* **Bridge** - an obtaining direct semantic relation between two exact `SchemeSenseCell` values from different semantic contexts under one exact profile.
* **BridgePredicateProfile** - the F.9-local by-value declaration of the direct relation's kind, symmetry or orientation, endpoint readings, correspondence or difference condition, applicability and as-of basis, Boolean truth condition, and stop dependencies.
* **Bounded-use claim** - an ordinary C.2.1 claim that says whether one exact obtaining Bridge is suitable for one named use, direction, use-specific rule, and loss tolerance. This phrase is descriptive, not a new public kind name.
* **Relation orientation** - how the Bridge kind orders or symmetrically relates its endpoint slots; it is not a use licence.
* **Use direction** - the ordered `<UseSourceSenseCell, UseReceivingSenseCell>` designated inside one bounded-use claim.
* **Observed semantic loss** - a difference or counterexample found in evidence. It can bear on a bounded-use claim but is not the use's permitted-loss tolerance.
* **Permitted-loss tolerance** - the maximum named loss accepted by one proposed use; it is content of that use's C.2.1 claim.
* **Bridge Card** - an optional C.2.1 claim-bearing episteme about an actual Bridge or a proposed relation candidate; it is not the relation.
* **CL (Congruence Level)** - optional F.9-local shorthand for the strength of evidence about a stated correspondence. It is neither a participant nor a use threshold and never grants a use.
* **senseFamily** - the local meaning family used by Part F. A `senseFamily` label is not a durable U-kind.

### F.9:6 - Bridge kinds

A Bridge kind classifies the direct semantic relation tested by a profile. It says what correspondence or difference obtains; it does not settle any proposed use.

#### F.9:6.1 - Same-family relation kinds

1. **Equivalence** - the endpoint senses have the same extension and relevant intension under the stated relation condition. The relation is symmetric and should be rare. A later use still names its direction, rule, and tolerance.
2. **Narrower-than** - the source sense is properly included in the receiving sense. The relation is asymmetric.
3. **Broader-than** - the source sense properly includes the receiving sense. The relation is asymmetric.
4. **Partial-overlap** - the senses have a non-empty intersection, while each has cases excluded by the other. The relation is symmetric.
5. **Disjoint** - the senses have no common admissible case under the stated readings. The relation is symmetric.

For inclusion, a narrower-to-broader proposed use is usually easier to justify than the reverse, but neither direction follows from the relation alone. A broader-to-narrower proposal normally needs refined endpoint cells and a separately tested Bridge plus a separately warranted bounded-use claim.

#### F.9:6.2 - Cross-family relation kinds

These kinds state semantic correspondence across different `senseFamily` readings. They explain a connection; they do not create substitution, evidence authority, policy force, or a receiving occurrence.

6. **Design-spec-to-run-occurrence** - a design sense corresponds to a run-time occurrence sense while remaining different in temporal and realization status.
7. **Measurement-evidence-for** - a measurement sense corresponds to the measured aspect of another sense. The kind is semantic; actual evidential support remains with A.10 or B.3.
8. **Policy-constraint-on** - a policy or deontic sense corresponds to a constrained behavioral sense. Actual obligation, permission, or authority remains with the policy or deontic governor.
9. **Viewpoint-correspondence** - a sense used in one view corresponds to a sense used in another view over an EntityOfConcern. View, description, publication, and source-use claims keep their direct owners.

### F.9:7 - Evidence about relation and use

Evidence must answer the question it actually bears on:

| Evidence question | What the evidence may support | What it cannot establish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Do the endpoint meanings satisfy the fixed profile? | the claim that the Bridge obtains, is false, or remains unresolved | suitability for an unnamed use |
| Does the Bridge suit `<u,d,r,t>`? | affirmative or negative polarity of the exact C.2.1 bounded-use claim | authorization or performance of the use |
| May the reader rely on that claim now? | an A.10 local `RelianceDisposition`, or the B.3 claim or disposition selected for the same bounded use | the Bridge occurrence, legal permission, or a receiving occurrence |

`CL` may summarize evidence strength for a stated correspondence: `0` contradicted, `1` weakly comparable, `2` bounded support with explicit counterexamples, and `3` matched stated invariants with no current material counterexample. It is optional and never serves as a use threshold. A `CL=3` label does not make a type-structure use suitable; the separate claim must still name the rule and tolerance, and reliance must still pass under A.10 or B.3.

Observed losses, unit differences, counterexamples, and invariant checks belong in the evidence path or card. The proposed use's permitted-loss tolerance belongs in its ClaimGraph. A loss observation can change without reidentifying either the fixed Bridge or the bounded-use claim; it may instead reopen the claim's polarity or the current reliance disposition.

### F.9:8 - Bridge occurrence and Bridge Card

Recover the direct relation before describing it. A Bridge may obtain without any card. Use a card only when durable reuse, delayed handoff, evidence review, audit, publication, or costly reversal makes a reusable claim package worthwhile.

```text
BridgeCard:
  ClaimMode: actual | candidate | negative
  BridgeOccurrenceRef?: exact ref, actual mode only
  EntityOfConcern: exact obtaining Bridge, or admitted F.9 Bridge relation kind for candidate or negative mode
  ProposedSourceSenseCellRef?: SenseCellAddressRef
  ProposedReceivingSenseCellRef?: SenseCellAddressRef
  ProposedBridgePredicateProfile?: by-value profile
  BoundedUseClaims?: each with u, d, r, t, polarity, and effective ReferenceScheme
  A10EvidenceUse?: exact evidence-provenance relation plus local RelianceDisposition
  B3Use?: positive assurance claim plus sufficient record, or exact non-positive disposition
  ObservedLossAndCounterexamples?:
  EvidenceWarrantAndCurrentness?:
  NearestNonUse?:
  CardReferenceScheme:
```

For `ClaimMode: actual`, the card's exact EntityOfConcern is the already individuated Bridge occurrence. The card may package the Bridge claim, one or more bounded-use propositions, their evidence and polarity, the exact A.10 relation and local disposition or the selected B.3 branch, currentness, and nearest non-use.

For `ClaimMode: candidate` or `negative`, no positive occurrence reference exists. The card's EntityOfConcern is the admitted F.9 direct `Bridge` relation kind. Its ClaimGraph designates the proposed endpoints and profile. `candidate` states that the proposed Bridge may obtain; `negative` states that its predicate does not obtain. Any bounded-use proposition in the same graph keeps its own polarity. Completing, approving, registering, or publishing this card creates no Bridge.

The exact `<ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, effective ReferenceScheme>` triple identifies the card episteme. A changed card edition, evidence path, reliance disposition, assurance claim or disposition, registry record, publication occurrence, form, carrier, or layout does not reidentify a fixed Bridge.

### F.9:9 - Boundary to coarsening and quantum-like export

Open F.9 when a receiving use needs an actual semantic relation between exact local senses. A lossy or approximate export is not thereby a Bridge, and an actual Bridge is not thereby a quantum-like state transition.

Use this order:

1. resolve the exact F.17 cells, state the relation-semantic profile, and test whether the Bridge obtains;
2. state the proposed use separately as `<u,d,r,t>` and give the C.2.1 claim its polarity;
3. recover the exact A.10 evidence-provenance relation and local disposition, or the B.3 claim or disposition selected for that use;
4. if the use happened, identify the actual governed object and apply its direct owner;
5. add a Bridge Card only if durable packaging pays;
6. open A.6.3.CSC, C.26.1, or C.26.2 only when coarsening, probe effects, or failure of any faithful-enough report is the live question.

When a state, metric, option, causal reading, or viability claim crosses the semantic boundary, its direct owner states what survives and what is lost. The Bridge supplies only the semantic-correspondence premise; the bounded-use claim supplies only the named suitability proposition.

### F.9:10 - Invariants

1. **Exact endpoints first.** A Bridge has exactly two F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` participants.
2. **No context object.** Semantic context is recovered from endpoint content and is not a relation participant.
3. **Different context is not enough.** Different projections trigger the question but do not establish the relation.
4. **Profile contains relation semantics only.** Receiving use, direction, use rule, loss tolerance, polarity, reliance, authorization, and receiving objects are absent from profile identity.
5. **Obtaining before occurrence reference.** A positive Bridge reference appears only after the fixed predicate is true and its dependencies are present.
6. **Use claim is separate.** Every proposed use names `u`, `d`, `r`, `t`, and polarity in a C.2.1 claim about the exact Bridge.
7. **Reliance is separate.** A.10 or B.3, not F.9 or the card, says whether current evidence or assurance supports relying on that claim.
8. **Role is not occurrence.** The named receiving-use role is ClaimGraph content; any actual Work, assertion, publication, relation, or operation application keeps its own identity and owner.
9. **Card separation.** Card identity, completion, approval, registration, and publication neither make the relation obtain nor make the use happen.
10. **Loss separation.** Observed semantic loss is evidence; permitted loss is tolerance inside the bounded-use claim.
11. **No authorization by implication.** Semantic suitability, evidence reliance, and assurance are not legal, policy, or deontic permission.
12. **No silent inverse or composition.** An inverse asymmetric relation and any direct A-to-C relation are tested independently.

### F.9:11 - Micro-examples

The labels below are readable aliases. An actual case resolves exact F.17 cells and tests one profile before stating a proposed use.

1. **Participant versus Agent.** A `Partial-overlap` Bridge may obtain between the exact BPMN and PROV senses. A separate claim may affirm use of the label "actor" in one orientation table under a rule that preserves the stated participation distinction. That claim creates no role assignment.
2. **Process design versus Activity occurrence.** A `Design-spec-to-run-occurrence` Bridge may explain the semantic connection. A separate claim can bound an explanatory use; it does not identify a run occurrence from a design artefact.
3. **Observation versus SLO fulfilment.** A `Measurement-evidence-for` Bridge can relate the exact senses. A separate claim asks whether the observation sense is suitable for interpreting one named SLO comparison; A.10 or B.3 governs reliance on the evidence.
4. **Subtype across OWL and a curated taxonomy.** An `Equivalence` Bridge obtains only under a profile whose relation condition includes the required class-level invariants. A separate claim asks whether one exact type-structure row may use that Bridge under its stated rule and zero material-loss tolerance.
5. **Accuracy in metrology versus data quality.** A `Partial-overlap` Bridge can make the shared word intelligible. A bounded-use claim may affirm that the label is suitable in one explanatory table while rejecting transfer of measurement methods or values.

### F.9:12 - Worked examples

#### F.9:12.1 - Service target and monitoring observation

A service team resolves two exact cells: the ITIL sense of an availability target and the SOSA sense of an availability observation. Profile `P-SLO-OBS-v2` states a `Measurement-evidence-for` semantic relation: the observation sense concerns a measured availability quantity relevant to the target sense, while observation and target remain different kinds of claim. The profile names the endpoint readings, direction of the semantic relation, applicability to the cited editions, Boolean condition, and required quantity-definition dependency. Current meanings satisfy it, so Bridge `b-slo-obs` obtains.

The team next proposes use `u-slo-check`: compare one observation result with the target. Direction `d-slo` is observation-to-target; rule `r-slo` requires the same quantity kind, aligned windows, and the stated unit conversion; tolerance `t-slo` permits the named rounding loss but no quantity-kind change. A C.2.1 claim with EntityOfConcern `b-slo-obs` states affirmative polarity for `<u-slo-check,d-slo,r-slo,t-slo>`.

Because this is an ordinary bounded evidence use below the B.3 threshold and no assurance claim is made, the team recovers the exact A.10 evidence-provenance graph relation for the observation record and states `RelianceDisposition=pass` only for `u-slo-check`. That supports relying on the claim within its boundary. It does not make the SLO fulfilled, authorize acceptance, or prove that comparison Work occurred. Those claims remain with their direct owners.

#### F.9:12.2 - Behavioral participant and access role

An exact `Partial-overlap` Bridge obtains between a BPMN participant sense and a named RBAC role sense when the profile's overlap and difference conditions are satisfied. A separate bounded-use claim proposes the label "actor" for one glossary row, in the stated direction, under a rule that preserves assignment moment, enforcement locus, multiplicity, and accountability differences, with zero tolerance for reading the label as a role assignment. Current evidence can support that label use under A.10.

If a project later says an RBAC role counts for a work step, it must recover an exact `U.RoleAssignment` under A.2.1 or F.6. The Bridge, affirmative label-use claim, and passing evidence disposition establish no assignment and no performed-work attribution.

#### F.9:12.3 - Subtype notions in one structural row

The endpoint senses are `OWL2:SubClassOf` under a cited OWL profile and curated-taxonomy `is-a` under one named taxonomy edition. The Bridge profile states `Equivalence` and makes its direct relation predicate true only when both endpoint meanings use compatible class-level reasoning and satisfy the stated acyclicity and anti-symmetry conditions. When those facts and dependencies are current, the exact Bridge obtains.

A second premise is still required. The C.2.1 claim names the proposed type-structure row, its source-to-receiving direction, the rule that preserves the three invariants, and zero material-loss tolerance. Only an affirmative current claim with passing A.10 reliance, or the positive B.3 assurance branch when that pattern is triggered, supports relying on the row. A contradicted relation invariant makes the Bridge predicate false; a use-specific tolerance failure can instead make the bounded-use claim negative while the Bridge remains unchanged.

#### F.9:12.4 - Setpoint versus service target

`CTRL:setpoint` and `ITIL:target` share a familiar word but usually have only `Partial-overlap` or are `Disjoint` under the exact readings. A proposed substitution in a control calculation receives a negative bounded-use claim because its rule and tolerance cannot preserve the physical-reference meaning. A didactic comparison may receive a different affirmative claim. Neither claim changes which Bridge obtains.

### F.9:13 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| ID | Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AP-1 | String-equals becomes sense-equals | Same spelling is used as proof of identity. | Resolve the exact cells and test the least-committing relation profile. |
| AP-2 | Profile as use licence | Direction, use rule, or tolerated loss is placed inside profile identity. | Keep only relation semantics in the profile; state `<u,d,r,t>` in a separate C.2.1 claim. |
| AP-3 | Bridge-alone substitution | “A corresponds to B, therefore use A as B.” | Require both the obtaining Bridge and an affirmative bounded-use claim, then check A.10 or B.3 reliance. |
| AP-4 | Symmetry grants two directions | An `Equivalence` Bridge is treated as two approved substitutions. | State and test each proposed use direction separately. |
| AP-5 | Inclusion grants the reverse use | A broader sense is silently substituted for a narrower one. | Refine the endpoint senses and test the reverse relation and bounded use independently. |
| AP-6 | Assessment score grants use | `CL=3` is cited instead of the exact rule, tolerance, and reliance path. | Treat the score as optional evidence shorthand; write and warrant the bounded-use claim. |
| AP-7 | Loss note becomes tolerance | An observed difference is treated as automatically acceptable. | Put observed loss in evidence and the accepted maximum in the claim's `t`. |
| AP-8 | Card creates relation or permission | An approved or published card is cited as obtaining or authorization. | Test the Bridge independently and recover authorization under its direct governor. |
| AP-9 | Named role becomes actual use | The claim says “publication use” or “comparison use”, so a publication or comparison is presumed. | Recover the actual receiving object and its identity under E.17, A.15.1, C.2.1, A.6.1, or the domain relation pattern. |
| AP-10 | Evidence failure erases the Bridge | A stale evidence path is said to make the semantic relation disappear. | Reopen reliance or the use claim; change the obtaining claim only when endpoint facts or the profile predicate changed. |
| AP-11 | Bridge as durable U-kind | A local correspondence is used to globalize meaning. | Keep kinds context-local unless the exact admission patterns independently admit a U-kind. |
| AP-12 | Silent relation composition | A-to-B and B-to-C are used as an A-to-C occurrence. | Test and individuate the direct A-to-C Bridge separately. |

### F.9:14 - Reasoning primitives

These are conceptual judgements, not work-enactment, card-completion, registry, publication, permission, or authorization rules.

#### F.9:14.1 - Direct Bridge occurrence

```text
P = <kind, symmetry-or-orientation, endpoint-readings,
     relation-condition, applicability-and-as-of,
     Boolean-truth-condition, stop-dependencies>

Bridge(A, B; P) obtains
iff
  A and B resolve to exact F.17 SchemeSenseCell values,
  semanticContext(A) != semanticContext(B),
  applicable(P, A, B, asOfBasis),
  bridgePredicate(P, A, B) = true,
  and requiredDependencies(P) are present.
```

No proposed use, direction, use-specific rule, loss tolerance, claim polarity, reliance result, or card is a component of `P`.

#### F.9:14.2 - Bounded-use proposition

```text
Bridge(A,B;P) obtains as b
and C is a C.2.1 claim with
  EntityOfConcern = b,
  ClaimGraph designating <u,d,r,t,polarity>,
  and an effective ReferenceScheme interpreting those designations
=> C says whether b is suitable for exactly <u,d,r,t>.
```

Changing `u`, `d`, `r`, or `t` changes `C`; it does not change `b`. Affirmative polarity is not evidence reliance, assurance, authorization, or occurrence.

#### F.9:14.3 - Ordinary A.10 reliance

```text
C is current and affirmative for <u,d,r,t>
and EP is the exact A.10 evidence-provenance graph relation for C and u
and RelianceDisposition(EP,u,d,r,t) = pass
=> the reader may rely on C only for that bounded evidence use.
```

A non-passing or narrower disposition supplies no support for the attempted use. The disposition is a local A.10 classification statement, not a new result kind.

#### F.9:14.4 - B.3 assurance branch

```text
C is current and affirmative for <u,d,r,t>
and B.3 is triggered
and a current positive assurance claim exists
and its minimum record is sufficient
and it carries the same bounded assurance use
=> positive assurance supports that bounded use.
```

A met threshold alone creates no positive claim. A no-assurance, insufficient-record, narrowed, rejected, withdrawn, abstaining, or blocked disposition stops or narrows the use as B.3 specifies.

#### F.9:14.5 - Receiving occurrence stays separate

```text
Bridge b obtains
and C is affirmative for proposed use u
and current reliance supports C for u
=> no Work, assertion, publication, relation, or operation application follows.
```

An actual receiving object exists only when its direct owner supplies its participants or arguments, obtaining or performance facts, and identity.

#### F.9:14.6 - Direction guard

Relation symmetry or orientation does not select `d`. Each proposed direction receives its own bounded-use claim. For an inclusion relation, a broader-to-narrower proposal normally requires refined endpoint senses and a separately tested Bridge; it cannot borrow safety from the inverse reading.

#### F.9:14.7 - Chained-use guard

```text
Bridge(A,B;P1) obtains
and Bridge(B,C;P2) obtains
=> no Bridge(A,C;P3) follows.
```

A composite proposed use must cite each obtaining Bridge, state one exact composite rule and accumulated tolerance in its own claim, and recover current reliance for that claim. If a direct A-to-C correspondence is needed, test it independently.

#### F.9:14.8 - Candidate-card guard

```text
candidate or negative Bridge Card exists
=> no positive Bridge occurrence follows.
```

The card concerns the admitted direct Bridge relation kind and places proposed endpoints, profile, ClaimMode, and polarity in its ClaimGraph. It creates neither relation nor receiving occurrence.

### F.9:15 - Relations

**Builds on:** F.17, F.18, C.2.1, F.0.1, F.7, and F.8.

**Coordinates with:**

* **A.10.** Owns the exact evidence-provenance graph relation and local `RelianceDisposition` for ordinary bounded evidence use.
* **B.3.** Owns the first decision about whether an assurance claim exists, the minimum reliance safety assurance record, a positive assurance claim when current, and explicit non-positive dispositions.
* **F.4, F.5, A.2.1, F.6, and A.15.1.** Naming, role assignment, required-role satisfaction, and performed-work attribution remain direct work-role claims.
* **F.8.** A mint-or-reuse decision may consume an obtaining Bridge plus a separately warranted bounded-use claim; it does not strengthen either.
* **A.2.6.** Scope translation may use an obtaining Bridge only together with an affirmative claim naming the exact direction, scope-correspondence rule, and loss tolerance. A.2.6 owns the translated scope and membership.
* **A.6.1.** Owns any actual operation application. A proposed use role in a Bridge claim is not an application binding.
* **A.6.5.** Relation-position labels and SlotSpec claims remain governed by slot discipline.
* **C.29.** Mathematical-lens use may cite a Bridge and bounded-use claim; C.29 still governs its mathematical object, preserved and lost structure, and actual lens use.
* **C.34.** Structural correspondence or morphism adequacy may cite an obtaining Bridge and a bounded-use claim but states its own preserved and lost architecture structure.
* **E.17.** Owns any actual publication occurrence. Publishing a card or claim does not make a receiving use occur.
* **A.6.3.CSC, C.26.1, and C.26.2.** Govern coarsening, probe effects, and no-faithful-enough-report cases when those questions are live.

### F.9:16 - Revision law

1. **Endpoint change.** A changed by-value scheme, local expression, or local-sense claim identifies another F.17 cell and requires another Bridge test.
2. **Profile change.** A changed kind, symmetry or orientation, endpoint reading, relation-specific correspondence or difference condition, applicability or as-of basis, Boolean truth condition, or stop dependency identifies another profile and occurrence candidate.
3. **Use-content change.** A changed receiving-use role, direction, use-specific rule, or permitted-loss tolerance identifies another C.2.1 claim while the fixed Bridge remains unchanged.
4. **Polarity change.** Affirmative versus negative is changed claim content; it is not a changed reliance disposition.
5. **Evidence or reliance change.** A changed evidence item, path, currentness window, A.10 relation, local `RelianceDisposition`, B.3 claim, record, or disposition reopens reliance without reidentifying the fixed Bridge or fixed C.2.1 claim.
6. **Obtaining change.** New endpoint facts may establish, refute, or leave unresolved the predicate for a fixed occurrence candidate without silently changing its identity.
7. **Card or publication change.** Apply C.2.1 to card identity and E.17 to publication identity; neither creates or removes the Bridge.
8. **Receiving occurrence change.** Reidentify or revise the Work, assertion, publication, relation, application, or other receiving object under its direct owner.

### F.9:17 - Acceptance tests

#### F.9:17.1 - Static conformance

* **SCR-F9-S01 (Well-typed direct relation).** Each actual Bridge has exactly two resolved F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` endpoints and one exact relation-semantic profile.
* **SCR-F9-S02 (Different semantic contexts).** The endpoint `<ReferenceScheme, LocalSenseClaim>` projections differ; same-context aliases stay with designation resolution.
* **SCR-F9-S03 (Profile boundary).** The profile contains only kind, symmetry or orientation, endpoint readings, relation condition, applicability and as-of basis, Boolean truth condition, and stop dependencies.
* **SCR-F9-S04 (Obtaining).** Current endpoint facts satisfy the exact profile and all required dependencies are present. Scheme difference, spelling, implementation, evidence score, card, registry, or publication alone fails this test.
* **SCR-F9-S05 (Separate bounded use).** Every use claim identifies exact Bridge `b`, names `u`, `d`, `r`, `t`, polarity, and an effective ReferenceScheme under C.2.1.
* **SCR-F9-S06 (Reliance branch).** The same bounded use has either the exact A.10 relation plus a passing local disposition, or the exact B.3 positive-claim or non-positive branch required by its trigger.
* **SCR-F9-S07 (No authorization overread).** Semantic fit, A.10 reliance, and B.3 assurance are not described as legal, policy, or deontic permission.
* **SCR-F9-S08 (Receiving-object boundary).** A named use role is never treated as performed Work, assertion, publication, relation, or operation application.
* **SCR-F9-S09 (Card truthfulness).** An actual card concerns an already individuated occurrence; a candidate or negative card concerns the admitted relation kind and has no positive occurrence ref.
* **SCR-F9-S10 (Plain action).** A practitioner can tell what relation to test, what use is proposed, what would stop reliance, and which downstream object still needs its own owner.

#### F.9:17.2 - Regression checks

* **RSCR-F9-E01 (Same Bridge, changed use).** Reversing direction, changing the use rule, or changing tolerance reidentifies the C.2.1 claim, not the Bridge.
* **RSCR-F9-E02 (Same claim, changed evidence).** Stale or stronger evidence changes the A.10 relation or disposition, or the B.3 branch, without reidentifying the fixed claim.
* **RSCR-F9-E03 (Threshold without positive assurance).** Meeting the B.3 threshold can yield a required record and explicit no-assurance or insufficient-record disposition; it does not manufacture a positive assurance claim.
* **RSCR-F9-E04 (Profile change).** A changed relation condition or endpoint reading identifies another profile and occurrence candidate.
* **RSCR-F9-E05 (Packaging change).** A changed card, registry entry, publication, form, or carrier leaves the Bridge and fixed bounded-use claim unchanged unless their own discriminators changed.
* **RSCR-F9-E06 (Positive proposal versus occurrence).** An affirmative claim with passing reliance proves no comparison Work, assertion, publication, direct relation, or operation application.
* **RSCR-F9-E07 (Polarity versus reliance).** Negative claim polarity and a non-passing reliance disposition remain different facts.
* **RSCR-F9-E08 (Reliance versus authorization).** Passing A.10 reliance or positive B.3 assurance does not imply permission.
* **RSCR-F9-E09 (No inverse or composition).** Neither an asymmetric inverse nor a direct A-to-C Bridge follows without its own profile and obtaining test.

### F.9:18 - Didactic distillation

Use this five-part script:

1. Find the two exact local senses.
2. Say what semantic relation holds and test whether that Bridge obtains.
3. State the proposed use separately: action, direction, rule, tolerated loss, and polarity.
4. Check whether current evidence or assurance supports relying on that claim; recover authorization separately if needed.
5. If the use happened, identify the actual object under its owner. Make a card only when reuse is worth the maintenance.

The short memory aid is: **relation first, use second, reliance third, receiving occurrence last; packaging is optional.**

### F.9:19 - Archetypal Grounding

#### F.9:19.1 - Tell

A Bridge is an actual semantic relation, not a synonym claim or enactment edge. Its profile says what correspondence holds. A separate claim says whether that relation suits one proposed use. Evidence, authorization, packaging, and actual performance remain separate.

#### F.9:19.2 - Show: service lane

The observation sense can bear a semantic relation to the target sense without being the target status. The team then states and warrants one comparison use; status and acceptance remain with their owners.

#### F.9:19.3 - Show: role lane

A process team and an access-control team both use `operator`. An obtaining overlap Bridge plus an affirmative, warranted label-use claim can support one glossary row. It cannot assign the access-control role to a work occurrence.

#### F.9:19.4 - Show: episteme lane

An actual card can package the relation claim, bounded-use claim, evidence path, and reliance disposition. It remains an episteme about the Bridge and creates neither the relation nor the receiving act.

### F.9:20 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: governance, architecture, ontology and episteme, pragmatics, didactics. Scope: universal for cross-context correspondence and reuse.

* **Governance bias.** The pattern adds a separate use claim and reliance check. Mitigation: keep them in ordinary sentences when durable packaging has no payoff.
* **Architecture bias.** Typed relation profiles can look heavier than synonym prose. Mitigation: the five-part script begins with the practical action and introduces exact terms only where they stop a real overread.
* **Ontology and episteme bias.** F.9 resists global meaning claims and keeps claims separate from their subject. Mitigation: explicit Bridges still permit practical cross-context comparison.
* **Pragmatic bias.** Conservative separation can feel slower than reusing a mapping table. Mitigation: a fixed Bridge can support many independently stated uses without being reidentified.
* **Didactic bias.** The four-object split can become bureaucratic if written only in internal nouns. Mitigation: every use starts by saying what a person will do, what rule they will follow, and what result would make them stop.

### F.9:21 - Conformance Checklist

An F.9 use conforms iff:

1. both endpoints resolve to exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values;
2. their semantic-context projections differ;
3. the Bridge has exactly two participants and one relation-semantic profile;
4. the profile contains no receiving-use or reliance content;
5. the profile applies, its Boolean predicate is true, and its dependencies are present before a positive occurrence is cited;
6. every proposed use is a separate C.2.1 claim naming `u`, `d`, `r`, `t`, polarity, and effective scheme;
7. observed loss stays in evidence while permitted loss stays in the bounded-use claim;
8. current reliance uses the exact A.10 or B.3 branch for the same bounded use;
9. no reliance or assurance statement is read as authorization;
10. any actual receiving object is recovered under its direct owner;
11. card, registry, publication, form, and carrier remain distinct from Bridge occurrence and use occurrence; and
12. inverse and composed relations are tested independently.

### F.9:22 - Consequences

**Benefits.** F.9 permits comparison, translation, and bounded reuse without collapsing local senses. One stable Bridge can support several differently directed or differently tolerant use claims, and evidence can change without silently changing relation identity.

**Costs.** A reader must state two premises instead of one: the semantic relation and the bounded-use proposition. Material reliance can also require A.10 or B.3 work. This cost is paid only when a real cross-context use is proposed; a card remains optional.

**Failure mode avoided.** A Bridge, score, or card can no longer act as a quiet substitute for role assignment, status transfer, evidence authority, authorization, publication, or performed-work attribution.

### F.9:23 - Rationale

Cross-context comparison is unavoidable, but the truth of a semantic relation and the suitability of one action are different claims. Putting direction, a use rule, and tolerated loss into `BridgePredicateProfile` would reidentify the relation whenever the proposed use changed. Putting them in a separate C.2.1 claim lets one Bridge remain fixed while several uses are affirmed, rejected, narrowed, or reopened independently.

The same separation keeps evidence honest. A.10 or B.3 can reopen reliance without erasing the relation. A card can travel without becoming the relation. A proposed use can be warranted without being authorized or performed. These boundaries preserve practical reuse and make each failure local and repairable.

### F.9:24 - SoTA-Echoing

| Claim need | SoTA practice | Primary source | Alignment with F.9 | Adoption status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shared labels across contexts are not enough. | Terminology and ontology practice distinguishes objects, concepts, definitions, designations, and typed relations. | ISO 704:2022; ISO 1087:2019; ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 (BFO). | F.9 resolves exact local senses and tests a direct relation instead of using string equality. | Adopt typed term, concept, and relation discipline. |
| Viewpoint boundaries remain explicit during reuse. | Architecture-description practice distinguishes entity of interest, description, viewpoint, view, model kind, concern, and correspondence. | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022. | F.9 keeps relation, use claim, card, view, and publication separate. | Adopt boundary-explicit correspondence. |
| Metadata and validation do not create use authority. | Web-data practice separates metadata, provenance, constraints, validation, and exchange from the governed data and act. | W3C Data on the Web Best Practices (2017); W3C SHACL (2017); W3C DCAT v3 (2024). | Evidence and packaging can support a bounded-use claim but do not make a Bridge obtain or grant permission. | Adapt provenance and validation discipline. |
| Interoperability is not semantic identity. | Model-based engineering improves traceability and formal semantics through explicit model elements and mappings. | OMG SysML v2.0 Language Specification (2025); OMG KerML v1.0 Specification (2025). | F.9 tests exact relation semantics and then judges each proposed use separately. | Adapt traceable mapping; reject interchange success as proof of identity or suitability. |

### F.9:25 - Bridge Card publication discipline

#### F.9:25.1 - Minimal truthful card

A reusable card states its mode and exact C.2.1 identity. An actual card names its already obtaining Bridge. A candidate or negative card instead names the admitted direct Bridge relation kind and places proposed endpoints, profile, mode, and polarity in its ClaimGraph. When the card packages a proposed use, it states `u`, `d`, `r`, `t`, polarity, observed loss, evidence, currentness, nearest non-use, and the exact A.10 or B.3 branch. Missing relation facts are never repaired by filling more fields.

#### F.9:25.2 - One occurrence, several claims and descriptions

Several bounded-use claims, cards, reviews, or publications may concern the same actual Bridge. Their C.2.1 identities differ when their ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, or effective scheme differs; the Bridge identity does not. Prefer one primary current card only when it reduces navigation cost.

#### F.9:25.3 - Revision without silent ontology change

If evidence, observed loss, reliance, assurance, wording, or publication changes while endpoints and profile remain fixed, revise the corresponding claim, evidence relation, disposition, card, or publication. Test another Bridge only when an endpoint or relation-semantic profile component changes.

### F.9:26 - Bundle and endpoint interaction

Viewpoint bundles, quality bundles, dashboards, reports, and endpoint bundles may cite Bridges and bounded-use claims, but they do not absorb their semantics. Each bundle keeps its own ontology and direct use rule.

When a quality-family claim crosses contexts, observed loss may bear on its bounded-use claim and on B.3 assurance, but neither fact retypes the quality family. An F.9.1 stance overlay may help readers interpret the claim; it remains a separate episteme and cannot widen the relation, proposed use, reliance, authorization, or occurrence.

### F.9:27 - C.29 mathematical-lens use relation

When a mathematical-lens use relies on cross-local meaning, first recover an actual F.9 Bridge. Then state the exact bounded-use claim for the lens direction, correspondence rule, and tolerated loss, and recover current reliance. C.29 owns the mathematical object, `LensMappingMode`, preserved and lost structure, lens-use judgement, and actual lens use. A Bridge can make a lens interpretable without making any lens use occur.

### F.9:28 - Review matrix

A reader can test bridge integrity with eight questions:

1. Do both endpoint refs resolve exact F.17 `SchemeSenseCell` values from different semantic contexts?
2. Does the profile say only which semantic relation holds, with its endpoint readings, condition, applicability, truth rule, and stop dependencies?
3. Is the Bridge claimed only after that fixed predicate is true?
4. Does each proposed use separately name the action, direction, correspondence rule, tolerated loss, and polarity?
5. Does the same use have the correct current A.10 evidence-provenance relation and local disposition, or the B.3 claim or disposition selected by its trigger?
6. Are semantic suitability, reliance, assurance, and authorization kept distinct?
7. If someone says the use happened, is the actual Work, assertion, publication, relation, operation application, or other object recovered under its own pattern?
8. Does any card remain optional packaging rather than the source of relation truth, permission, or occurrence?

Repair *same*, *equivalent*, *align*, and *map* prose in that order: recover the exact senses; test the Bridge; state the bounded-use claim; check reliance; recover authorization or the actual receiving object only when those questions are live. Do not start from a polished card or a score.

### F.9:End
