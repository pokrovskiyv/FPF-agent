## F.19 - Ontology-First Plain Technical Rewriting

> **Type:** Plain-technical precision-restoration pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative for FPF-governed technical prose unless explicitly marked informative; informative for external source prose until it is rewritten for FPF use

**Plain-name.** Ontology-first plain rewriting.

**Intent.**
Repair technical prose whose object, claim, relation, action, role- or function-shaped wording, or flow is buried under extra apparatus. The repair is not cosmetic plain-language editing. It first separates content from apparatus by ontology, then writes the remaining content in the shortest plain technical form that preserves FPF kinds, slots, claim boundaries, and admissible use. Repair any remaining word, head, name, or wording-use problem with `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `E.10.ROLE`, `A.6.F`, `F.18`, or the specific pattern that defines, constrains, or tests the remaining claim.

**Builds on.** `E.8`, `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `F.18`, `A.6.P`, `A.7`, `E.18`, `E.21`, and source-use, evidence, assurance, gate, work, decision, publication, architecture, characteristic, state-family, and relation patterns when those objects carry the repaired span's claim.

**Coordinates with.** `E.19`, `E.22`, `E.23`, `A.19.SPR`, `C.2.P`, `C.16.P`, `C.30.P`, `E.11`, `I.2`, pattern-quality records, review records, `DRR`s, projection loci, and source-side notes.

### F.19:0 - Use this when

Use `F.19` when a bounded piece of technical prose is trying to say something precise, but the reader must pass through role labels, container words, status words, process traces, quality proof, an unsupported negative classification, reference boilerplate, or pattern-application metaphors before the object and action are visible.

Typical in-scope prose includes:

- FPF pattern prose;
- `DRR` text and architecture notes;
- review findings and quality-loop records;
- project-facing FPF guidance;
- source prose being rewritten for FPF use;
- other technical prose whose accepted ontology, domain model, controlled vocabulary, or role model must survive simplification.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Authors replace one official-sounding phrase with another. The text becomes smoother or shorter while the hidden kind error remains, or it becomes easy to read by losing the FPF kind, slot, relation position, system-role-kind or assignment distinction, function or functioning claim, claim boundary, or admissible-use boundary.

**What this buys.** Plain technical wording becomes an ontological discipline with less apparatus: fewer words, clearer objects, fewer invented alternatives to reject, and no loss of technical semantics.

**First useful move.** Mark the span under repair. Split it into content candidates and apparatus candidates before rewriting either side.

**Not this pattern when.**

- If the problem is only one overloaded word or head after the content is visible, apply `E.10`.
- If the problem is a durable reusable name, apply `F.18`.
- If the span already names the content-bearing relation, source-use relation, state-family value, architecture label, characteristic, quality term, function wording, evidence claim, gate claim, work claim, decision claim, or other FPF object named by value, use the specific pattern that defines, constrains, or tests that claim and say what it contributes.
- If the source text is only being observed and not admitted into FPF-governed prose, keep the observation source-side.

**Primary EntityOfConcern in plain terms.** One phrase-level, sentence-level, row-level, paragraph-level, or small-section technical-prose repair whose goal is kind-preserving plain expression.

### F.19:1 - Problem frame

Mature technical languages accumulate enough ontology that many bad sentences are not bad because the terms are unknown. They are bad because a simple technical claim is wrapped in process language, role language, status language, quality-proof evidence, pattern-reference boilerplate, or alternative classes introduced only so the sentence can reject them.

The repair question is:

> What content remains when words that add no object, kind, relation, claim, system-role or function distinction, flow, evidence value, or user-facing action are removed?

Examples inside FPF:

- "`A.15` handles the claim" when the text needs to say that `A.15` applies to a work-planning claim;
- "pattern text" when the text means "the pattern" or "the pattern of concern";
- "governing relation" when the named object is a pattern, not a relation;
- long "not X, not Y, not Z" paragraphs when the text needs a positive object, action, and one stop condition;
- corpus-projection proof written inside a pattern whose own user-facing action is not corpus projection.

The same defect appears outside pattern prose. A system note may hide an evaluation claim inside process language; a project note may treat a dashboard as evidence authority when it is a publication form; an architecture memo may replace a scale-preference claim over alternatives with a platform label.

These failures confuse coupled transformation flows. A pattern under development, a pattern being applied, a quality evaluation of that pattern, a project work occurrence, a source publication, and a projection record are different objects. They may influence one another; they do not become one another by being mentioned in the same paragraph.

### F.19:2 - Problem

How can FPF make technical prose plain without:

- treating plain language as a synonym-replacement exercise;
- deleting content-bearing technical terms as "jargon";
- replacing established terms with colourful synonyms or role nicknames;
- letting process, review, projection, or quality proof become pattern content;
- repeating the same boundary doctrine in every local pattern;
- hiding current ontic slot, relation-position, use-relation, or claim-kind changes under a shorter phrase;
- turning every phrase repair into a new local mini-ontology?

### F.19:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| Plain wording vs ontology | Short prose helps readers, but careless simplification erases kinds, slots, relation positions, use relations, system-role kinds, classification judgments, assignment occurrences, function or functioning claims, ordinary meanings, or claim boundaries. |
| Precision vs apparatus | Technical precision needs kind recovery, but extra role, record, card, table, schema, data-structure wrapping, locus, flow, status, and process words can bury the claim. |
| Local repair vs semantic change | Some extra words are boilerplate; others carry a hidden kind, relation, current ontic slot, relation position, use relation, evidence-use relation, or admissible-use boundary. |
| Flow separation vs readable prose | Development, evaluation, projection, and use flows must stay distinct without making every sentence narrate those flows. |
| Reuse vs repetition | References to related patterns matter, but repeated "if X, apply Y" prose can become reference fanout. |
| Plainness vs synonym churn | Plain prose should reduce apparatus, not create a new set of loose paraphrases for established FPF terms. |

### F.19:4 - Solution

Use `OntologyFirstPlainRewrite` as a five-step repair over one bounded span.

1. **Bound the span.** Name the sentence, row, paragraph, or small section under repair. Name visible apparatus candidates: pattern-application drift, role label, container word, status word, process trace, quality proof, unsupported negative classification, reference boilerplate, record, card, table, schema, data-structure wrapping, or other overwrap.
2. **Separate content from apparatus by ontology.** For each phrase part, ask what object, head kind, claim or relation, current slot or relation position, use or publication relation, admissible use, participant, and relevant flow position it carries. A trigger-shaped phrase remains content until its actual claim is recovered. Use `E.10.ROLE` once for role-shaped wording: for example, *reviewer role* may name a local system-role kind or participation in a review relation. Use `A.6.F` once for function-shaped wording: for example, *pump function* may name an expected transformation, while *the pump is functioning* states a condition. Infer neither branch from the trigger word. If a phrase part changes a live value, keep it as content; if it only restates process, a label, an unsupported negative classification, reference boilerplate, record, form, or quality proof, classify it as apparatus.
3. **Remove or move apparatus.** Delete the apparatus or move it to the document, record, note, or publication relation where it belongs: `DRR`, review record, quality result, architecture note, README, ToC, `E.11`, or `I.2` entry locus, projection record, release or landing evidence document, or source-side note. Do not replace it with a smoother synonym, role label, container word, status word, record, card, table, schema, data-structure wrapper, or publication-form word.
4. **Restore remaining content precision.** Restore every complement needed to determine the claim: what was selected, changed, compared, transformed, published, evaluated, or relied on. Use `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `E.10.ROLE`, `A.6.F`, `F.18`, or the specific pattern that defines, constrains, or tests the remaining word, head, relation, claim, slot, use, name, or admissible-use boundary.
5. **Rewrite and check loss.** Write the shortest plain technical sentence that preserves the repaired object, kind, claim, relation, action, current slot, relation position, use relation, any live system-role, function, ordinary-wording or flow distinction, established term, and admissible use. Also preserve only the action-guiding claim details consumed by the declared use: exact predicate and participants, polarity, quantity or threshold, temporal boundary and order, criterion, tolerance, exception, applicability condition, and other explicit operational detail. The rewrite fails if it changes a live value without an accepted semantic decision or becomes harder for the declared reader to use.

A contrast of the form ‘X is not A but B’ is useful only when the text or working situation has already made A relevant: an earlier claim, an observed or source-backed confusion, a serious competing classification, or a safety or non-use condition that changes action. If A appears only so the author can reject it, remove A and state X's positive kind, relation, action, or result directly. Keep problematization of an observed failure, a fair dispute with stated grounds, ordinary negation whose polarity is content, and a documented anti-pattern; judge their actual claims rather than their negative grammar.

Keep ontology visible only where it carries the sentence. A term-source or type annotation is needed only when it changes how the reader identifies the object, kind, relation, slot, use, publication boundary, admissible use, or applicable rule. A record, card, table, schema, data structure, dashboard, or named form remains apparatus unless it carries one of those values. If ordinary domain wording already preserves them, keep the ordinary sentence. "The aircraft flies" is better than a typed expansion unless the flight function, system kind, or slot relation is under repair.

Treat `exact`, `direct`, `current`, `governed`, `subject`, `owner`, `defining`, and similar qualifiers as content only when they distinguish live alternatives. Remove them when no such contrast changes the truth, action, stop, or reliance. A PatternID may remain an ordinary citation; expand it into a claim-bearing episteme, `ClaimGraph`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.Method`, actor, assignment, `U.Work`, or another formal identity only when the current claim or a named later use depends on that distinction.

Keep ordinary practitioner action and instrumental pattern-use wording ordinary when it does not assert a particular dated Work occurrence. “Use `E.9` to record the decision” and “the framework maintainer compares the editions” need no invented Method, MethodDescription, performer, assignment, or Work identity.

Open the identity-bearing branch only when the sentence deliberately asserts a particular dated `U.Work` occurrence. Then point to its basis: A.13 first, independent A.15.1 Work admission second, and F.6 afterward only for precise assignment-bound attribution. Add a local system-role kind or a separate System-classification judgment only when that neighboring claim matters. Treat a pattern episteme as a `U.MethodDescription` only after `A.3.2` establishes that it has an already admitted Method as its `EntityOfConcern` and explains how that Method is performed. Otherwise cite the applicable pattern content as guidance and use `A.3.1` for the Method itself.

When one sentence joins unlike claims and no genuine common head covers them, split the claims and use `E.10:0.2c.17` for the resulting list. Do not invent an umbrella object merely to preserve one grammatical subject.

Use the full result form when the repair must be inspectable; otherwise a local rewrite plus the kind-preservation check is enough.

#### F.19:4.1 - Result form

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TextSpanRef` | Bounded span under repair. |
| `ApparatusCandidateSet` | Visible pattern-application, role, record, card, table, schema, data-structure wrapping, locus, flow, status, process, unsupported-negative-classification, reference, or quality-proof apparatus candidates. |
| `ContentCandidateSet` | Phrase parts that carry an object, claim, relation, value in `KindAndClaimMap`, action-guiding claim detail, flow position, evidence-use value, or user-facing action. |
| `ObjectOfConcern` | Object the span is about. |
| `KindAndClaimMap` | Head kind, claim kind, relation kind, current slot, relation position, use relation, publication relation when it changes admissible use, scope, and—when another pattern contributes—the pattern id plus what its content defines, constrains, or tests. |
| `ActionGuidingClaimDetails` | Only details consumed by the declared use: exact predicate and participants, polarity, quantity or threshold, temporal boundary and order, criterion, tolerance, exception, applicability condition, or another explicit operational distinction. Empty when none is current. |
| `FlowPosition` | Design, run, or coupled-flow position only when that position changes the claim or use. |
| `ApparatusDisposition` | Removed, moved, retained as content, or blocker when separation is not yet possible. |
| `RemainingContentPrecisionRestoration` | `not needed`, `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `E.10.ROLE`, `A.6.F`, `F.18`, a named pattern plus its concrete contribution, or blocker. |
| `PlainRewrite` | Short rewrite after apparatus removal and remaining-content precision restoration. |
| `KindPreservationCheck` | Pre-rewrite and post-rewrite object kind, relation or claim kind, current slot, relation position, use relation, admissible use, scope, and every `ActionGuidingClaimDetails` value; disposition is `preserved`, `split`, `intentionally changed by accepted decision`, or `blocker`. |
| `LossCheck` | What became false, less actionable, less local, less current, less recoverable, or less usable—including lost quantity, threshold, polarity, order, timing, criterion, tolerance, exception, or applicability condition—if the rewrite is accepted. |

#### F.19:4.2 - Pattern-prose specialization

When the repaired prose is an FPF pattern, apply the same algorithm with one purpose test:

> Does this sentence address the pattern's intended user, or does it record development, review, projection, landing, quality, or source-management evidence about the pattern version?

If it records evidence about the pattern version, keep that evidence outside the pattern unless the pattern's own primary `EntityOfConcern` is that evaluation or projection object. The evidence can cause edits to the pattern; it is not automatically pattern content.

Pattern prose keeps:

- the pattern's own primary `EntityOfConcern`;
- the first useful move;
- the practical delta and cost of missing it;
- local boundary prose only for a documented local confusion and named stop condition;
- short declarative references to related patterns after the pattern's own content is visible.

Pattern prose moves out:

- package-placement rationale;
- correspondence about producing the draft rather than using the pattern;
- quality-status proof;
- README, ToC, `E.11`, `I.2`, retrieval, card, monolith-parity, or landing evidence;
- repeated boundary doctrine already carried by another pattern.

### F.19:5 - Archetypal Grounding

| Grounding slice | Before | F.19 repair |
|---|---|---|
| Pattern use, ordinary | "`A.15` handles the work-planning claim." | "Use `A.15` to plan the work." |
| Pattern use, identity-bearing | "The pattern performed the planning." | "Engineer E performed planning Work W. Point to W's basis: A.13 first, independent A.15.1 Work admission second, and F.6 afterward only for precise assignment-bound attribution; use `A.3.2` only if a named episteme describes the enacted Method." |
| Pattern and relation, ordinary | "The governing relation is `C.29`." | "Use `C.29` to test whether the mathematical lens is admissible for this task." |
| Pattern and relation, identity-bearing | "`C.29` says so." | "If a comparison depends on the rule edition, cite the claim-bearing episteme and `ClaimGraph` that contain the admissibility rule." |
| Pattern-text purpose | "Pattern text must not contain corpus projection evidence." | "A pattern must not contain projection evidence about itself." |
| Evaluation scope | "The evaluation has pre-landing host-set use." | "This is a host-only evaluation; corpus-entry values need corpus-projection evidence." |
| Unsupported negative classification | "This Guide is not a seminar, not a transcript, but a learning route." No seminar-or-transcript confusion has been established. | "This Guide teaches the seminar's subject through explanations, examples, exercises, and checks." |
| Role-shaped label | "The platform owns scale." | "This scale compares platform and non-platform alternatives." |
| Publication and evidence mix | "The dashboard is the evidence gate." | "The dashboard presents evidence. Use `A.10` for the evidence claim and `A.21` for any gate decision." |
| Comparison, carrier, and publication mix | "E.4.PFIP preserves expression, carrier, and publication." | "The framework maintainer compares the predecessor and candidate publication expressions for the declared use. Use `E.10:0.2c.17` to separate the expression comparison from carrier-bearing and publication-occurrence claims." |
| Operational-detail loss | "Rewrite 'Boil for five minutes after simmer begins' as 'Cook until ready'." | "Reject the rewrite. It keeps a broad cooking action but loses the five-minute duration, start condition, and usable stop criterion." |

### F.19:6 - Bias-Annotation

`F.19` deliberately biases toward shorter, reader-facing prose. The protected value is kind-preserving clarity, not brevity by itself. A rewrite that removes terms while losing object kind, relation kind, current ontic slot, relation position, use relation, source-use relation, or admissible-use boundary is worse than the original.

`F.19` also protects against two common reviewer biases:

- **unsupported-negative-classification bias:** introducing one or more alternative classes only so the sentence can reject them;
- **apparatus-preservation bias:** replacing one process, role, record, card, table, schema, data-structure wrapper, locus, flow, status, or quality-proof phrase with another phrase that still hides the object.

### F.19:7 - Conformance checklist

| Check | Requirement |
|---|---|
| `CC-F19-1` | The repair names the text span and visible apparatus candidates before rewriting. |
| `CC-F19-2` | The repair separates apparatus from content by the values named in `KindAndClaimMap`, `ActionGuidingClaimDetails`, and `FlowPosition`; lexical dislike is not enough. Role- and function-shaped wording remains content until `E.10.ROLE` or `A.6.F` recovers the actual claim. |
| `CC-F19-3` | Apparatus is removed or moved before wording-use precision restoration is applied to the remaining content. |
| `CC-F19-4` | Content-bearing wording remains content and is repaired by `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `F.18`, or the specific pattern that defines, constrains, or tests the remaining claim rather than deleted as style. |
| `CC-F19-5` | A removed apparatus word is not replaced by a synonym, metonymy, role label, container word, or status word that carries the same hidden apparatus. |
| `CC-F19-6` | Established FPF terms are preserved unless a named precision-restoration or naming pattern changes them. |
| `CC-F19-7` | Every accepted rewrite includes a `KindPreservationCheck`; a change to object kind, relation or claim kind, current slot, relation position, use, scope, or a live action-guiding discriminant without an accepted decision remains a blocker. |
| `CC-F19-8` | Development, evaluation, projection, landing, use-found, repair, and source-management evidence stay in the evidence, projection, release, or publication loci that carry them unless the text is about that flow object. |
| `CC-F19-9` | The accepted rewrite is shorter or clearer without losing technical semantics or action-guiding detail. A longer rewrite is admissible only when it recovers a hidden kind, relation, role or assignment distinction, function claim, slot, claim boundary, quantity, threshold, polarity, order, timing, criterion, tolerance, exception, or applicability condition needed by the declared use. |
| `CC-F19-10` | The repair records any loss of truth, action, stop criterion, value, usability, locality, currentness, kind recoverability, or explicit operational detail used by the declared reader. |
| `CC-F19-11` | Term-source or type annotation is used only when it changes the object, kind, relation, slot, use, publication boundary, admissible use, or rule the reader must apply; stable ordinary prose is not expanded into type labels. |
| `CC-F19-12` | The accepted plain rewrite passes MG-DA cold-reader recovery: a reader without the `DRR`, campaign notes, or author memory can state the content-bearing object, kind or ordinary status, relation or claim position, admissible use, next practical action, and every quantity, threshold, ordering, timing, criterion, exception, or applicability condition that changes that action. When another pattern contributes, the reader can recover its id and contribution. Broad heads such as `object`, `item`, `value`, `relation`, `record`, `condition`, `basis`, `material`, and unqualified `specialization` are not plain enough when they hide what the practitioner must recognize. |
| `CC-F19-13` | Every added qualifier or formal identity has a named live contrast: it changes truth, action, stop, migration, publication, reuse, or reliance. An ordinary PatternID citation does not by itself require a `ClaimGraph`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.Method`, actor, assignment, or `U.Work` expansion. |
| `CC-F19-14` | After apparatus removal, the sentence names every complement and live discriminant needed to determine what was selected, changed, compared, transformed, published, evaluated, relied on, started, stopped, ordered, limited, or excepted. |
| `CC-F19-15` | Ordinary practitioner action and instrumental “use pattern X” wording stays ordinary when it does not assert identity-bearing dated Work. When it does, point to the basis: A.13 first, independent A.15.1 Work admission second, and F.6 afterward only for precise assignment-bound attribution. Use one thin `E.10.ROLE` or `A.6.F` route for a role- or function-shaped trigger; do not copy either recovery taxonomy. `U.MethodDescription` appears only after the `A.3.2` test passes. |
| `CC-F19-16` | A heterogeneous list is split when its members need different heads or predicates; the rewrite uses `E.10:0.2c.17` instead of inventing one umbrella head. |
| `CC-F19-17` | A negative alternative remains only when an earlier claim, observed or source-backed confusion, serious competing classification, or safety or non-use condition makes it relevant to the declared use. Without that reason, the sentence states the positive object, relation, action, or result directly. Problem statements, disputes, material polarity, and documented anti-patterns remain content. |

### F.19:8 - Common anti-patterns and how to avoid them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| Lexical paint | One umbrella word is replaced by another while the object kind stays hidden. | Recover the object kind and rewrite in the object's technical name. |
| Hypergeneric repair | The rewrite uses `object`, `item`, `value`, `relation`, `record`, `condition`, `basis`, `material`, or `specialization` to sound precise while hiding the actual object, relation, rule, or action. | Restore the practitioner-recognizable object and relation; for specialization, say what specializes what and which inherited or changed slots or uses matter. |
| Plain-language drift | Smooth prose drops the kind named by value or admissible-use boundary. | Remove apparatus first, then restore remaining wording precision before shortening. |
| Flow smuggling | Development, projection, landing, or evaluation evidence is written as user-facing guidance. | Move the evidence to the review record, quality result, projection record, release document, or other appropriate evidence document and keep only the resulting user-facing action or boundary. |
| Role-shaped label as ontology | The word *role* is treated as one technical value or replaces the object kind. | Keep the phrase as content until `E.10.ROLE` recovers the actual claim; do not infer a branch from the word alone. |
| Function-shaped label as ontology | The word *function* is treated as one technical value or as proof of functioning, capability, assignment, or Work. | Keep the phrase as content until `A.6.F` recovers the claim; allow metonymy or several simultaneous readings without copying its dispatch here. |
| False common head | One grammatical subject is made to select, compare, carry, publish, and evaluate unlike things. | Split the claims and use `E.10:0.2c.17`; retain only heads that fit every listed member. |
| Slot label as ontology | A slot, field, relation-position, or use-relation label replaces the object kind, or the same object in several slots or relation positions is treated as several kinds. | Preserve object kind, slot, relation position, and use separately; cite the specific pattern only when its definition, constraint, or test is needed. |
| Apparatus-looking data structure | A record, card, table, schema, dashboard, or data-structure word is kept because it sounds precise, but it does not carry the EntityOfConcern, slot relation, publication boundary, admissible use, or next action. | Remove it, or use `E.24.CD`, `E.24.PUB`, or the specific content pattern when the structure really carries a candidate-ontic, publication, or domain relation. |
| Unsupported negative classification | The sentence introduces one or more alternative classes only to reject them, although no earlier claim, observed confusion, serious competing classification, or action-changing limit made them relevant. | State the positive object and action. Keep a negative alternative only when its reason is present in the text or working situation and the distinction changes use. |
| Over-annotation as precision | The rewrite replaces a clear domain sentence with type labels, source-ontology tags, or slot names that do not change the claim. | Keep the domain sentence and annotate only the term or relation under repair. |
| Triggerless formal expansion | A PatternID citation becomes an “exact direct current subject owner”, `ClaimGraph`, Method, actor, assignment, or Work claim even though no alternative identity changes the result. | Keep the ordinary citation and action. Open the formal branch only after naming the contrast or later use that consumes it. |
| Overformalized precision | The rewrite preserves all terms but makes the sentence harder to think with or generalize from. | Keep the content-bearing kind and claim, drop apparatus that changes neither, and use a plain technical sentence plus a reference named by value where needed. |
| Apparatus-preserving paraphrase | A rewrite changes wording but keeps the same status, process, or quality-proof apparatus. | Return to the apparatus-and-content split and repair by value. |

### F.19:9 - Consequences

`F.19` makes technical prose easier to read because it removes apparatus before shortening the sentence. It also makes reviews stricter: a pleasant paraphrase does not count unless the pre-rewrite and post-rewrite kind, relation, current ontic slot, relation position, use relation, admissible use, and scope are preserved or deliberately changed by accepted decision.

The cost is that some edits need a short repair note before they look simple. That cost is intentional. Without the note, agents tend to do lexical replacement, narrow a graph into a sequence, widen a work occurrence into a method, turn a publication into evidence, or hide a pattern application under a route-like metaphor.

### F.19:10 - Rationale

Plain technical style in FPF is not a separate aesthetic layer. It is the visible result of ontology-first repair with less apparatus. The order matters:

1. remove or move boilerplate;
2. restore remaining wording, names, relations, slots, and uses through the specific pattern contribution needed by the claim;
3. write the shortest sentence that keeps the recovered meaning.

Putting `F.19` beside wording-use restoration keeps `E.10` from becoming a phrase-style super-pattern. `E.10` catches words and heads whose kind or use is hidden; `E.10.ROLE` and `A.6.F` recover the actual role- or function-shaped claim. `F.19` catches the earlier phrase-level problem: content may not be visible until process, label, status, reference, quality, or negative-catalogue apparatus is removed.

### F.19:11 - SoTA-Echoing

`SoTA` here means the best current contribution to the stated practice question, not the newest or most formal publication. The comparison below is current to 2026-08-19; a source's official status does not by itself make it SoTA.

| Practice question | Exact source and status | Selected payload and limit | Source-use decision, receiving locus, qualification, and reopen |
|---|---|---|---|
| How should ordinary technical prose help its intended reader act without being "dumbed down"? | ISO 24495-1:2023, *Plain language — Part 1: Governing principles and guidelines*, current published foundation (`https://www.iso.org/standard/78907.html`); Digital.gov, *Principles of plain language* and *Writing for understanding*, current living US-government practice guide (`https://digital.gov/guides/plain-language/principles`, `https://digital.gov/guides/plain-language/writing`), checked 2026-08-19. | Declare the reader and task; put the usable object and action first; organize for finding, understanding, and use; keep terms the intended reader needs. Neither source defines FPF ontology or requires expert prose to use general-public vocabulary. | **Adapt — reason:** these moves improve F.19's ordinary path without changing its semantic boundary. **Receiving loci:** F.19:0 first useful move; F.19:4 steps 1 and 5; `CC-F19-9` and `CC-F19-12`. **Qualification/currentness:** current standard and current practice guide, not FPF semantic authority. **Reopen:** a new edition changes a used principle, or cold-reader evidence shows that these moves no longer support the declared use. |
| How should plain prose address readers outside the author's specialty while retaining scientific content? | ISO 24495-3:2026, *Plain language — Part 3: Science writing*, Edition 1, current published standard (`https://www.iso.org/standard/86938.html`). | It extends the reader-sensitive principles of Part 1 to science writing for people with different backgrounds and interests. It expressly does not govern specialist scientific writing, and it supplies no test for FPF kinds or terms. | **Adapt — reason:** the cross-specialty reader boundary sharpens the cold-reader check without authorizing loss of technical content. **Receiving loci:** F.19:4 step 5 and `CC-F19-12`. **Qualification/currentness:** current for plain science communication, not proof that a specialist FPF distinction is dispensable. **Reopen:** the standard changes materially, or an F.19 case needs a different expert-to-expert boundary. |
| When is controlled technical language worth its added restriction and maintenance cost? | ASD-STE100, *Simplified Technical English: Standard for Technical Documentation*, Issue 9 (2025-01-15), current issue (`https://www.asd-ste100.org/`). | Its controlled vocabulary and writing rules reduce lexical and syntactic ambiguity in multilingual, safety-sensitive maintenance documentation. That setting does not show that a controlled dictionary, one-word/one-meaning rule, or compliance apparatus improves ordinary FPF prose. | **Reject as the default FPF language; adapt only as a comparison probe — reason:** F.19's cheap ordinary path remains better unless a declared high-risk multilingual use shows otherwise at comparable effort. **Receiving loci:** F.19:4 step 5 and `CC-F19-9`/`CC-F19-12`; no controlled-language machinery is imported. **Qualification/currentness:** current controlled-language practice with an aerospace-maintenance origin. **Reopen:** an F.19 case demonstrates that bounded restrictions outperform the ordinary path for its declared reader and risk. |
| What action-guiding detail must survive when the prose tells someone what to do? | IEC/IEEE 82079-1:2019, *Preparation of information for use (instructions for use) of products — Part 1: Principles and general requirements*, Edition 2, published and marked for revision (`https://www.iso.org/standard/71620.html`). | It distinguishes step-by-step instructions within information for use and treats usable instructions as purpose- and user-sensitive. Its full information-management process, competency scheme, and evaluation apparatus are much broader than a bounded F.19 rewrite. | **Adapt the action-preservation branch; reject the surrounding documentation process — reason:** sequence, condition, quantity, warning, and stop detail improve the worked case and checks, while the larger apparatus does not improve them at comparable effort. **Receiving loci:** F.19:4 step 5, `ActionGuidingClaimDetails`, the operational-detail case, and `CC-F19-9`/`CC-F19-10`/`CC-F19-14`. **Qualification/currentness:** current published product-information reference, already marked for revision. **Reopen:** its successor changes a used principle, or an F.19 case requires a further action detail. |
| Can legally constrained prose become clearer without losing controlled terms or obligations? | ISO 24495-2:2025, *Plain language — Part 2: Legal communication*, current published standard (`https://www.iso.org/standard/85774.html`); US SEC, *A Plain English Handbook: How to Create Clear SEC Disclosure Documents* (1998; SEC page 1999), retained lineage (`https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/newsextrahandbook`). | The current standard shows that reader access can coexist with nuanced concepts, required structures, rights, and obligations. The SEC handbook is lineage for concrete, direct presentation. Neither source makes legal drafting or disclosure compliance part of ordinary FPF authoring. | **Adapt the meaning-preservation lesson; reject legal-process transfer — reason:** the branch supports necessary terms without importing a legal-document method. **Receiving loci:** F.19:4 step 5 and the plain-language-drift and synonym-churn boundaries. **Qualification/currentness:** ISO 24495-2 is current legal-communication guidance; the SEC handbook is lineage only. **Reopen:** F.19 acquires a legal-use case, or a later source changes the retained lesson. |
| What prevents a plain rewrite from changing an FPF claim while removing apparatus? | Current FPF patterns `E.8`, `E.10`, `E.10.ARCH`, `E.10.ROLE`, `A.6.F`, `F.18`, `A.6.P`, and `E.21`, internal governing dependencies. | They recover the actual word, head, role- or function-shaped claim, relation, name, use, and quality loss before the sentence is shortened. They are not external evidence that F.19 is SoTA. | **Adopt as internal dependencies — reason:** they define, constrain, or test the meaning that F.19 must preserve. **Receiving loci:** F.19:4 steps 2–5, the result form, conformance checks, and Relations. **Qualification/currentness:** current FPF dependencies, kept thin rather than copied here. **Reopen:** a dependency changes a distinction or check used by F.19. |

### F.19:12 - Relations

| Related pattern | Relation |
|---|---|
| `E.8` | In FPF pattern authoring under `E.8`, use `F.19` to keep pattern bodies addressed to their intended users. |
| `E.10` | After apparatus removal, use `E.10` for remaining wording whose kind, relation, or admissible use is hidden; use `E.10:0.2c.17` when a heterogeneous list needs different heads or predicates. |
| `E.10.ARCH` | Use its shared wording-use recovery architecture for the remaining content. |
| `E.10.ROLE` | Route role-shaped wording there once to recover the actual claim; F.19 does not copy its distinctions. |
| `A.6.F` | Route function-shaped wording there once to recover the actual claim, including metonymic or multiple readings; F.19 does not copy its dispatch. |
| `F.18` | Use it for durable reusable names after kind and use are known. |
| `A.6.P` | Use it when the remaining content hides relation kind, endpoint, basedness, anchoring, current ontic slot, relation position, or use relation. |
| `A.19.SPR`, `C.2.P`, `C.16.P`, `C.30.P` | For remaining state-family, source or publication, characteristic or scale, and architecture or structure wording, use the corresponding pattern. |
| `E.21` | An `E.21` evaluation may use `F.19` findings through `PrecisionRestorationProfile` and lower affected quality coordinates without creating one coordinate per apparatus symptom. |
| `E.19`, `E.22`, `E.23` | During review, framing, or improvement-loop work, use `F.19` while keeping quality-loop records out of pattern prose. |
| `E.11` and `I.2` | Use their first-entry cues and expanded entry-disambiguation cases for phrase-level apparatus repair. |
