## B.3 - Trust & Assurance Calculus (F–G–R with Congruence)

> **Plain‑English headline.**
> B.3 defines how **assurance** (trust) is **computed and propagated** for both physical systems and epistemes and their carriers, using a small **typed assurance tuple** (**F–G–R**: **F/R** characteristics plus **G** as scope object) and **conservative aggregation rules** that respect the Γ‑invariants and A.15 **Strict Distinction**. It treats the **E.14 Working‑Model layer** as the publication-facing assertion layer for claims, with assurance **attached downward** (Mapping - Logical - Constructive - Empirical) per E.14.

**Use this when.** Use `B.3` when a claim, label, dashboard, evidence bundle, model, report, or gate-support package is being used to raise assurance, trust, readiness, compliance, safety, release confidence, `F`, `G`, `R`, or `CL` for a named claim.
**First output.** One typed `Assurance(H, C \| K, S)` claim per named assurance claim `C`, or an explicit no-assurance-claim disposition when the encountered publication face, carrier, rendering, or cue is only a cue, evidence pointer, wording issue, gate decision, role assertion, status assertion, commitment, or work occurrence.
**Not this pattern when.** Not when the item is only a cue, action invitation, boundary wording, evidence question, currentness question, gate decision, release decision, role assertion, status assertion, commitment, or work occurrence; use `A.15`, `A.6`, `A.10`, `A.21`, `A.20`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, or `A.15.1` as appropriate.

**Assurance load posture.** Use the lightest assurance result that can decide the live assurance use. A cue or source pointer gets no B.3 tuple. A local, non-release, non-compliance, non-safety, non-reused claim may be written as a compact bounded assurance claim statement that names claim, assurance use supported by the assurance tuple or relying context, evidence pointer, limit, and stop/reopen condition. Reserve a full typed `Assurance(H, C \| K, S)` claim for readiness, compliance, safety, release confidence, trust, `F`, `G`, `R`, `CL`, or reused assurance input.

**Continuous assurance posture.** Treat an assurance claim as an engineering-process state that can decay, reopen, narrow, or be withdrawn, not as a one-time checklist result. For model, data, AI, documentation, release, or operational assurance, name the drift, monitoring, incident, evidence-refresh, version-change, policy/gate-change, or residual non-admissible-use condition that reopens the assurance claim.

### B.3:1 - Problem frame

Every non‑trivial result in FPF—*a composed system is safe*, *a model is credible*, *a conclusion holds*—is a **claim** that rests on **composed evidence**.

* For **U.System** holons (Γ\_sys), assurance is about *capabilities and constraints* under stated conditions.
* For **U.Episteme** holons (Γ\_epist), assurance is about the *quality of support* for a statement or model.

To make such claims comparable and auditable across domains, B.3 introduces a **Trust & Assurance Calculus** that:

* uses a **small typed assurance tuple** (**F–G–R**: **F/R** characteristics plus **G** as scope object) governed by conservative propagation rules (this is **not** a state space),
* accounts for **integration quality** via **Congruence Level (CL)** along the edges of a `DependencyGraph` (B.1.1, A.14),
* and composes these values with **Γ‑flavours** while respecting the **Invariant Quintet** (IDEM, COMM/LOC or their replacements, WLNK, MONO).

B.3 is **conceptual and normative**: it defines *which assurance components must be published and how they propagate*. How you improve those components (e.g., formalize, replicate, reconcile, or admissibly widen/narrow scope) is the job of KD‑CAL actions (the knowledge‑dynamics patterns; references are descriptive, not required to read here).

**Mechanism linkage.** For law‑governed operation families (e.g., **USM/UNM**) authored as **mechanisms**, use A.6.1 — U.Mechanism to publish **OperationAlgebra/LawSet/AdmissibilityConditions** and the **Transport** clause (Bridge‑only, CL/CL^k/CL^plane). All such penalties **reduce `R/R_eff` only**; **F/G** remain invariant.

**Working‑Model handshake (alignment with E.14 - B.3.5 - C.13).**
Assurance consumes two inputs declared in the **Working‑Model** assertion layer (CT2R‑LOG, B.3.5): the **justification stance** `validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}` and, where present, the **grounding link** `tv:groundedBy`. Structural claims that aspire to the strongest guarantees rely on **Constructive** grounding as a **Γₘ** (Compose‑CAL) narrative referenced via `tv:groundedBy`. No assurance record or publication **defines** Working‑Model wording or layout (downward‑only dependence, E.14).

### B.3:2 - Problem

Without a disciplined calculus, four chronic failures appear:

1. **Trust inflation:** Averaging or summing heterogeneous “quality” tags yields aggregates that look better than their weakest parts, violating WLNK.
2. **Scale confusion:** Mixing ordinal and ratio scales (e.g., averaging `F` ordinal scale values with numeric reliabilities) produces meaningless numbers.
3. **Congruence blindness:** Integration quality (how well pieces fit) is invisible; brilliantly strong parts connected by weak mappings produce overconfident wholes.
4. **Scope drift:** Design‑time formalism and run‑time evidence are composed into a single score; dashboards then claim “assurance” for a blueprint using live data, or vice versa.

### B.3:3 - Forces

| Force                                    | Tension                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conservatism vs. Synthesis**           | Avoid overclaiming (WLNK) ↔ allow real gains from better integration (raise CL) or true emergence (B.2).                            |
| **Universality vs. Domain nuance**       | One calculus for systems and epistemes ↔ physics and epistemology use different primitives; keep them comparable but not identical. |
| **Simplicity vs. Fidelity**              | Keep the assurance tuple small and typed (A.11) ↔ capture enough structure to be informative and improvable by KD‑CAL actions.           |
| **Static clarity vs. Dynamic evolution** | A score must be reproducible today ↔ tomorrow it should legitimately rise after formalization, replication, or reconciliation.      |

### B.3:4 - Solution — **Part 1: The assurance tuple and the universal aggregation skeleton**

B.3 defines **what** the assurance components are, **how** they live on nodes and edges of the dependency graph, and the **shape** of the aggregation that any Γ‑flavour must honor when producing an *assurance result*.

#### B.3:4.1 - The F–G–R assurance components (typed; `F/R` CHR, `G` USM)

We standardize **two node characteristics**, **one node scope object**, and **one edge characteristic**:

1. **Formality (F)** — *how constrained the reasoning is by explicit, proof‑grade structure.*

   * **Scale kind:** **ordinal** (its scale values do not admit arithmetic).
   * **Canonical scale values (example):**
        `F0 Informal prose` - `F1 Structured narrative` - `F2 Formalizable schema` - `F3 Proof‑grade formalism`.
   * **Monotone direction:** higher is better (never lowers assurance when all else fixed).

2. **ClaimScope (G)** — *the declared set of `U.ContextSlice` where the result applies.*

   * **Type:** **set‑valued USM scope object** (A.2.6), **not** a CHR characteristic.
   * **Well‑typed operations:** **membership** and **set algebra** (`∈`, `⊆`, `∩`, `⋃`, `SpanUnion`, plus declared Bridge translation / widen / narrow / refit).
   * **Scalar proxy (report‑only):** if a profile needs a number for reporting, it MAY publish an explicitly declared **`CoverageMetric(G)`**; such a proxy **MUST NOT** replace `G` in norms, gates, bridge semantics, or CL-bearing relation decisions.
3. **Reliability (R)** — *how likely the claim/behavior holds under stated conditions.*

   * **Scale kind:** **ratio** in `[0,1]` (or a conservative ordinal proxy when numeric modeling is unavailable).
   * **Monotone direction:** higher is better.

2. **Congruence Level (CL)** — *edge property: how well two parts fit* (semantic alignment, calibration, interface Standard).

   * **Scale kind:** **ordinal** with a **monotone penalty function** `Φ(CL)` where `Φ` decreases as CL increases.
   * **Canonical scale values (example):**
     `CL0 tentative guess` - `CL1 plausible mapping` - `CL2 validated mapping` - `CL3 verified equivalence`.
   * **Interpretation:** low CL reduces the credibility of the *integration itself* (not the parts), and therefore **penalizes** the aggregate **R**.

> **Strict Distinction (A.15).**
>
> * Assurance components live as **value/scope claim components**: **F/R** as characteristics, **G** as a scope object, while Γ‑flavours fold **structure/order/time**.
> * Do not smuggle assurance components into structural edges; keep **F/R/CL** explicit as CHR metadata and **G** explicit as a USM scope object.

> **Assurance shoulders (Working‑Model split).**
> **Mapping** raises **TA** (typing, fit/CL). **Logical** and **Constructive** contribute to **VA** (intended relation semantics; Γₘ extensional identity for structure). **Empirical Validation** contributes to **LA** (evidence in a bounded context). These supports attach **downward** from the Working‑Model assertion layer (E.14).

#### B.3:4.2 - Assurance as a typed claim

B.3 speaks about **assurance of a specific typed claim** `C` over a holon `H` under context `K` and scope `S ∈ {design, run}`:

```
Assurance(H, C | K, S) = ⟨F_eff, G_eff, R_eff, Notes⟩
```

* `C` examples: *meets load L*, *argument Q holds*, *model M predicts within δ*.
* `K` binds assumptions (environment, usage, priors).
* `Notes` include the **SCR** (all sources, B.1.3), **OrderSpec/TimeWindow** where applicable (B.1.4), cutsets, and evidence citations (A.10).

This tuple gives readers an at‑a‑glance view (didactic primacy) while preserving the pieces needed for audit and improvement.

**Validation modes (declaration, normative).**
Each published Working‑Model assertion **SHALL** declare **`validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}`** (E.14).
— *postulate* → pragmatic working claim; **Empirical Validation** is **required** for audit.
— *inferential* → reasoned consequence; **Logical** assurance carries the reasoning requirement.
— *axiomatic* → constructive identity; **structural** edges MUST provide a Γₘ narrative and a **`tv:groundedBy`** pointer (C.13, B.3.5).

**Design vs run (no chimeras).** Assurance tuples for **design‑time** and **run‑time** SHALL be reported **separately** and **not composed into a single score**; see the *Scope drift* hazard in §2 and the obligations in B.3.3.

#### B.3:4.2a - Authority-looking labels and dashboard tiles

A badge, label, score, dashboard tile, credential display, provenance mark, compliance-looking mark, model card, datasheet, data card, assurance document, attestation label, assurance-looking note, or generated confidence phrase does not enter assurance calculus or improve `F`, `G`, `R`, `CL`, readiness, safety, compliance, trust, release confidence, or assurance by display alone.

**Adversarial misuse guard.** Do not let dashboards with favorable labels, compliance-looking badges, old model cards, provenance labels, assurance-looking documents, or generated confidence phrases supply missing evidence, limitations, scope, decay, or argument for an assurance claim.

Valid B.3 dispositions for such an item are:

| Disposition | Use when | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No assurance use | The item is only a cue, source pointer, evidence question, currentness question, gate decision, role assertion, status assertion, commitment, boundary wording, or work occurrence. | Return to `A.15`, `A.10`, `A.6`, `A.21`, `A.20`, `A.2.1`, `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, or `A.15.1`; no tuple is needed. |
| Compact bounded assurance claim statement | The claim is local, non-release, non-compliance, non-safety, not reused as assurance input, and does not affect people/team status. | Record the claim, assurance use supported by the assurance tuple or relying context, evidence pointer, limit, and stop/reopen condition in the current work record. |
| Full assurance tuple | The item is being used to raise readiness, compliance, safety, release confidence, trust, `F`, `G`, `R`, or `CL`. | One typed `Assurance(H, C \| K, S)` claim per named assurance claim `C`, with argument/evidence/limitations/decay. |
| Rejected or narrowed assurance claim | Evidence, scope, argument, currentness, or limitations do not support the attempted assurance claim. | State the assurance claim, work claim, or reliance claim that the current assurance tuple does not carry, then name the next legitimate formalization, evidence repair, scope narrowing, or claim narrowing move. |

Build a `B.3` assurance claim only when the next work move or reliance move depends on a typed assurance claim. The typed assurance claim must name:

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Claim and assurance use carried by the tuple | The exact claim `C` and the assurance use the tuple carries: readiness, release, audit, compliance, safety, model credibility, or another named assurance use. |
| Holon, context, and scope | `H`, `K`, and `S` plus audience or relying context when the label is human-facing. |
| Evaluation condition | What was evaluated, under which method, policy, test, review, measurement, or assurance case. |
| Evidence carriers | The `A.10` evidence path, carrier refs, source-maintenance role assignments, windows, verifier rule, relying-party rule, and proof results or status results that support the assurance tuple. |
| Argument and support rationale | The argument pattern, assurance case, or reason why the evidence carriers support claim `C` under `K` and `S`, including assumptions, defeaters, and open challenges. |
| Limitations and rival explanations | Scope limits, claims or uses not carried by the assurance tuple, stale display, spoofing, copied text, generated text, proxy-for-value substitution, provenance-only support, context shift, and known failure conditions. |
| Decay and reopen condition | Valid-until, revocation, policy version, gate version, model version drift, monitoring change, incident signal, evidence refresh, and contest or redress path. |

**Assurance evidence minimization.** A typed assurance result should cite the minimum `A.10` support needed for the named assurance claim and relying context. Use redacted, hashed, scoped, or role-mediated evidence refs when raw carriers would expose personal data, secrets, privileged logs, tenant identifiers, security-sensitive traces, incident details, or unnecessary identities; do not build a full assurance dossier when pointers preserve enough recoverability.

Role prompts for assurance use:

| Role in the situation | Prompt |
| --- | --- |
| Assurance reviewer | Which named `Assurance(H, C \| K, S)` claim is actually being made or revised? |
| Auditor or reviewer | Which evidence path, argument, limitation, decay condition, reopen condition, and relying context must be recoverable? |
| Manager or release reader | Which desired decision or action is outside B.3 and must instead use `A.15`, `A.21`, `A.10`, or another exact source? |
| Model or data reader | Which documented admissible-use statement or external intended-use field, evaluation condition, version, window, limitation, drift, and incident condition bound the model or data documentation? |
| Evidence source-maintenance role assignment | What evidence carrier or scoped pointer must be exposed without turning documentation presence into an assurance claim? |

Display guidance for assurance labels: a readiness, safety, compliance, trust, release-confidence, or assurance display should show the named assurance claim, assurance use supported by the assurance tuple or relying context, evaluation condition, evidence-path ref, scope, window, limitation, decay condition, reopen condition, and assurance, work, or reliance claims not supported by the assurance tuple. A label that only points to documentation should remain a source pointer, not an assurance result.

Incident-learning fields for assurance overread: visible label, documentation record, or carrier, attempted assurance claim, missing tuple or evidence-path field, assurance claim, work claim, or reliance claim not supported by the assurance tuple, limitation or decay condition that defeated the claim, next legitimate formalization, evidence repair, scope narrowing, or claim narrowing move, and upstream repair item for documentation, evidence refs, assurance label wording, monitoring, or reopen trigger.

Contestability and redress path: when the B.3 material-reliance threshold is live, the B.3 result should name the claim being contested, evidence path, limitation or decay condition, reviewer or decision forum, safe interim disposition, and what evidence or scope change would reopen the assurance claim.

If those fields are missing, the encountered publication face, carrier, rendering, or cue remains an orientation label, source pointer, evidence pointer, documentation record, carrier, or unsubstantiated confidence cue. Return to `A.15` when the question is whether that lane may guide work or reliance, to `A.10` when the question is evidence, currentness, or provenance, and to `A.6` when the question is mixed policy, API, or schema wording.

**Positive repaired path.** When an assurance use is live and the supporting fields are present, return the smallest typed assurance result that can guide work: the named claim, context, scope, evaluation condition, evidence path, argument, limitations, decay condition, and reopen condition. That result may improve or justify assurance only for the stated claim and scope; other action, gate, evidence, work-occurrence, or compliance uses still need their own exact sources.

Constructive assurance moves:

- narrow `G` to the actually supported scope;
- raise `F` by formalizing argument/method structure;
- raise `R` by adding validation, replication, more probative, repeated, current, or more relevant evidence;
- improve `CL` by repairing mappings, units, interfaces, or integration edges;
- separate design assurance from run assurance;
- add limitations, assumptions, defeaters, monitoring, drift, and reopen triggers;
- reject or downgrade the assurance use when those moves are not available.

Negative controls:

| Visible item | What it may support | What it must not support without a full tuple |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source-backed release dashboard tile | If the tile is a current view of `A.21` `GateDecision` or `DecisionLogRef` plus an `A.10` evidence path, it may support gate-passage reliance outside B.3 for the named release and environment. B.3 is live only when the tile is also asked to raise readiness, safety, compliance, trust, or release-confidence assurance. | Release approval by display, compliance proof, rollback success, work occurrence, or assurance increase without a typed assurance claim. |

| Credential, compliance, or provenance label | Bounded source, holder, status, history, or documentation support when evidenced. | Safety, truth, permission, gate passage, readiness, or assurance claim by label presence. |
| Model card, datasheet, data card, assurance document, or assurance-looking note | Scoped documentation for a named claim, documented admissible-use statement or external intended-use field, evaluated condition, limitation, version, and window. | Higher `R`, broader `G`, higher `F`, better `CL`, readiness, compliance, safety, or release confidence by document presence. |
| Generated confidence phrase | Source-finding or explanation relation when grounded. | Assurance increase, authority, approval, or evidence by wording alone. |

Model cards, datasheets, data cards, assurance documents, and assurance-looking notes are external documentation records or source carriers unless they are mapped into existing `FPF` claims and publication faces. They do not add MVPK face kinds and do not bypass `B.3` when the live use is an assurance claim.

**Lint trigger.** A model card, datasheet, or data card cited as readiness, safety, compliance, release confidence, or assurance proof requires documented intended-use match, evaluation condition, limitations, an `A.10` evidence path, and one typed `Assurance(H, C \| K, S)` claim for the named assurance claim. Without those, return `no assurance use` or a rejected/downgraded assurance claim.

Positive repaired example: a model card plus documented admissible-use statement or external intended-use field, evaluation condition, version, window, limitations, an `A.10` evidence path, and a typed `Assurance(H, C \| K, S)` claim may support assurance for that named model claim in that evaluated context. The same documentation still does not support another deployment context, gate passage, release work occurrence, or compliance proof unless those sources are separately present.

#### B.3:4.2b - Minimum reliance safety support record

Use this B.3 section when the B.3 material-reliance threshold is live: reliance on a visible source may materially change behavior, safety, release, compliance, public or protocol behavior, access, resource allocation, people/team status, operational action, or controlled-object regulation. The first B.3 move is to decide whether assurance is live; if it is, write the minimum reliance safety support record for the named reliance use. Mere attention shift, learning, orientation, source-finding, or carrier wording correction is not enough.

`RelianceSafetyCase` is the local Tech label for this B.3 support-record role. The plain phrase is **minimum reliance safety support record**. The label is not a new FPF pattern, Core kind, safety authority, gate, policy source, approval, certificate, compliance method, or general safety-case ontology.

Support role: the trigger and non-trigger table is a B.3 recognition aid, the minimum support record table is a minimum local record aid, and the worked reliance-threshold slices are regression/review slices. They are not a universal project checklist, sign-off sequence, untyped status vocabulary, or replacement for `Assurance(H, C | K, S)`; use them only when the named material reliance trigger is live. This local section returns the attempted reliance to the B.3 assurance relation; it does not create an extra SEMIO authority or cross-pattern relation vocabulary.

Affordability card: orientation or source-finding stays outside B.3; bounded local reliance stays with the local evidence, explanation, CV, gate, or pattern-quality relation unless assurance is live; threshold reliance opens the minimum reliance safety support record only when the B.3 material-reliance threshold is live. Plain wording remains ordinary unless it changes admissible use, support, evidence, gate, assurance, work, decision, or neighboring-pattern exit.

Common wrong first reading: a safety-looking note, safety case, compliance-looking label, or dashboard warning is a certificate, approval, or gate. First honest entry: state one typed B.3 assurance claim with A.10 evidence path, assumptions, limitations, defeaters, residual uncertainty, monitoring or stop condition, contest/redress, supported use, and unsupported use.

First admissible B.3 move: name the reliance use, the assurance claim, the affected context or audience, the trigger that makes B.3 live, the A.10 evidence path, the argument, limitations, defeaters, contest/redress path, stop or monitoring condition, supported use, and unsupported use. If those pieces are absent, return the source to `A.10`, `E.17.EFP`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `E.19`, or the local relation rather than inventing assurance by label.

Trigger and non-trigger cases:

| Encountered source use | B.3 disposition | Minimum action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary source-backed report, citation, model card, datasheet, data card, or documentation record with no assurance use and no B.3 material-reliance threshold | No B.3 assurance use. | Stay in `A.10` with claim, carrier, evidence path, window, supported use, unsupported use, and reopen trigger. |
| Generated explanation, generated summary, or didactic reconstruction used only for source-finding or learning | No B.3 assurance use. | Stay in `E.17.EFP` unless operative claims are relied on through `A.10` evidence paths or another exact receiving source. |
| Local conformance label, `CV.Status`, benchmark result, or score near a release conversation but not used to raise assurance | No B.3 assurance use. | Keep `CV.Status` in `A.20`, gate-decision publication in `A.21`, pattern-quality result in `E.19`, measurement or marker support in `C.16`/`A.10`, and no assurance tuple unless an assurance claim is live. |
| Confidence, calibration, prediction interval, or abstention reason tied to one reversible local act | Compact bounded assurance claim only when the act depends on assurance; otherwise no B.3 use. | State act, context, window, calibration basis, stop condition, supported use, and unsupported attempted use; open `C.27` or `G.11` when time, expiry, refresh, or monitoring changes the move. |
| Safety-looking note, compliance-looking label, public warning, dashboard state, generated operational explanation, or status display is intended or reasonably foreseeable to make the B.3 material-reliance threshold live: reliance materially changes behavior, safety, release, compliance, public or protocol behavior, access, resource allocation, people/team status, operational action, or controlled-object regulation. | Minimum reliance safety support record is required. | Build the B.3 support record with A.10 evidence path and any live `A.20`, `A.21`, `E.19`, `C.27`, `G.11`, `B.2.5`, or representation/retargeting dependency. |

Minimum support record:

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Reliance use and assurance claim | The behavior, safety, release, compliance, public or protocol behavior, access, resource allocation, people/team status, operational action, or controlled-object regulation that would materially change, and the assurance claim being made about that change. |
| Context, audience, and affected role | The bounded context, environment, user group, team, public audience, relying role, affected role, tenant, release line, service, or work target. |
| Source carrier and evidence kind | The visible source, publication face, record, cue, marker, conformance label, dashboard, explanation rendering, score, warning, or status display, plus the evidence kind being used. |
| A.10 evidence path | Claim, carrier, producer or method trace, currentness/window, source-maintenance role assignment, evidence relation, rival explanation, supported use, unsupported use, and reopen trigger. |
| Argument and assurance basis | Why this evidence path supports the assurance claim under the context; include assumptions, limitations, defeaters, residual uncertainty, and unacceptable-harm or risk-tolerance condition where live. |
| Dependencies | Any live `A.20` CV status, `A.21` gate decision, `E.19` pattern-quality result, `C.27` temporal claim, `G.11` refresh/decay relation, `B.2.5` control relation, or representation/retargeting relation. |
| Monitoring, rollback, or stop condition | What observation, incident, drift, contest, expiry, changed profile, changed source, or failed check stops, narrows, reopens, or withdraws the reliance. |
| Contest and redress | The disputed claim or disposition, affected use or harm, accountable review role, admissible challenge evidence, possible disposition change, outcome record, and reopen trigger. |
| Public and private evidence boundary | Public summary, reviewer-only evidence, affected-party contestable minimum, and any scoped, redacted, hashed, or role-mediated evidence ref needed to preserve recoverability without overexposure. |

Positive repaired path: when the trigger is live and the support record is sufficient, return the smallest typed assurance result that can guide the reliance: named assurance claim, reliance use, context, evidence path, argument, limitations, dependencies, monitoring or stop condition, contest/redress path, supported use, and unsupported use. When the record is insufficient, narrow the reliance, degrade the assurance use, abstain, require evidence, reopen the source, or block the attempted assurance use; do not convert a polished source into safety acceptance.

A safety case is accepted only as a bounded assurance argument for the named reliance use. It remains contestable by defeaters, changed evidence, changed context, monitoring failure, residual-uncertainty breach, or admissible affected-party challenge. Stop when the named reliance use, unsupported use, limitations, defeaters, contest/redress path, monitoring or rollback condition, and reopen condition are sufficient for this threshold trigger; do not expand the record into a general safety dossier.

Accountable review is insufficient by title alone. It counts here only when it can change the disposition, records the outcome, and leaves the supported use, unsupported use, and reopen condition inspectable.

Misuse guard: an incoming or attempted-reliance `RelianceDisposition=safety-case-required` must name the trigger that makes B.3 live. A source producer, dashboard-state publisher or maintainer, model producer, documentation producer, or status-label issuer cannot self-clear a threshold-bearing reliance by attaching the label. Where the B.3 material-reliance threshold is live, the support record must expose an accountable review role and a contest path capable of changing the disposition.

Affected-party contestable minimum: public/private evidence separation is valid only if the affected party can see enough of the claim, source class, disposition, affected use, accountable role, and allowed challenge evidence to challenge the result. Reviewer-only evidence may stay protected, but protected evidence cannot make redress non-contestable while the assurance use still claims contest or assurance support. A blocked, abstained, degraded, or evidence-needed assurance use is not final if admissible challenge evidence, missing affected-party evidence, changed source, changed context, monitoring failure, or redress can materially change the disposition.

Worked reliance-threshold slices:

| Slice | B.3 move | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A public-service or access-status display changes who receives access, support, or review. | Use the minimum reliance safety support record for the named status-changing reliance, with contest/redress and unsupported use. | The display is not approval, safety, fairness, compliance, or resource authority by itself. |
| An SRE dashboard changes incident behavior or resource allocation. | Use B.3 only when the dashboard is asked to raise assurance or safety-bearing reliance; keep ordinary evidence/currentness in A.10. | Use B.2.5 only for a live control relation and A.21 only for a live gate decision. |
| A public warning or synthetic-content label changes perceived meaning but there is no evidence that it changed the target behavior, release risk, safety posture, or control relation. | Keep the label as A.10 evidence or source-finding/orientation cue; require audience/action effect evidence before B.3 reliance. | Do not infer safety, compliance, behavior change, or control effect from label presence alone. |
| A manufacturing conformance label appears near release. | Keep local CV or conformance evidence in `A.20`, `A.21`, `C.16`, or `A.10`; open B.3 only when assurance, safety, compliance, or release-confidence reliance is live. | Conformance presence is not safety acceptance or release permission. |
| A software supply-chain attestation is cited as runtime safety. | Use `A.10` for origin/build/process claims and B.3 only for the named assurance claim with argument, limitations, defeaters, and stop condition. | Build provenance is not runtime safety or operational permission. |
| A people or team status badge changes permissions, resources, or review priority. | Require a support record that names affected role, relying role, evidence path, contest path, and disposition change condition. | The badge issuer cannot self-clear the people/team-status-changing reliance by issuing the badge. |
| A standards-document clause is reused as approval. | Use `A.10` for evidence of the clause; open the exact approval, commitment, gate, or assurance relation only when live. | A cited clause is not project approval, gate passage, or assurance by quotation. |

Do not read the support record as a graded scale, standalone status, universal assurance checklist, release certificate, or new safety-case state family. B.3 consumes the support record only as typed assurance support for the named claim and reliance use.

#### B.3:4.3 - Where the numbers live (and do not)

* **On nodes:** each input holon contributes its local `F, G, R` according to its nature (system vs. episteme).
* **On edges:** each integration step has a `CL` (congruence of the connection).
* **Not inside Γ:** Γ consumes `D` and returns a composed holon; B.3 governs how `F, G, R, CL` **propagate** to the **Assurance** tuple for that composed holon. This keeps Γ algebra and assurance calculus **separable** and reviewable.
* **Not a state space:** `⟨F,G,R⟩` is an **assurance tuple**, not a `U.CharacteristicSpace`; do **not** draw “trajectories” in `⟨F,G,R⟩`. For episteme evolution, use **ESG** states and the **assurance‑trace** hooks (see below).

#### B.3:4.4 - Universal aggregation skeleton (domain‑neutral)

Any Γ‑flavour that claims an **Assurance** result **must** adopt the following **conservative skeleton**:

1. **Formality:**

   ```
   F_eff = min_i F_i
   ```

   *Rationale:* the least formal piece caps the formality of the whole (WLNK on F).
   *Monotone:* raising any `F_i` cannot reduce `F_eff`.

2. **ClaimScope:**

   ```
   G_eff = SpanUnion({G_i}) constrained by support
   ```

   * “SpanUnion” is a **set/coverage union** in the domain’s space.
   * **Constraint:** any region in the union **unsupported** by reliable parts is **dropped** (WLNK).
   * *Monotone:* adding supported span cannot reduce `G_eff`.

3. **Reliability (penalized by integration):**

   ```
   R_raw = min_i R_i                       // Weakest-link cap
   R_eff = max(0, R_raw − Φ(CL_min))       // Congruence penalty
   ```

   * `CL_min` is the **lowest** Congruence Level (`CL`) value on any edge in the proof spine / critical integration region for the claim `C`.
   * `Φ` is **monotone decreasing** and **bounded** (never makes negative values).
   * *Monotone:* increasing any `R_i` or any `CL` cannot lower `R_eff`.

4. **SCR and Notes:**
   * The aggregate SHALL produce a SCR listing all contributing nodes and edges, with their F, G, R, CL, scopes, and evidence links (A.10).
   * The SCR SHALL additionally display the **describedEntity** (`describe(Object→GroundingHolon)`) and the **ReferencePlane** for the claim, and present a **separable TA/VA/LA table** of evidence contributions with **valid_until/decay** marks and the **Epistemic‑Debt** per § B.3.4.
   * If order/time mattered for the claim, attach the OrderSpec or TimeWindow identifiers (B.1.4).

This skeleton is **mandatory**. Domain‑specific patterns may add **refinements** (e.g., separate epistemic “replicability” vs. “calibration”) as long as they **do not violate** WLNK or MONO and preserve scale kinds.

#### B.3:4.5 - System vs. Episteme — same shape, different readings

* **For systems (Γ\_sys):**

  * `F` reads as **engineering discipline** (from ad‑hoc method to verified specification).
  * `G` reads as **operational envelope coverage**.
  * `R` reads as **assured reliability** under `K` (requirements, environment, test campaigns).
  * `CL` often arises at **interfaces** (Boundary‑Inheritance Standard; B.1.2): poorly controlled interfaces reduce `R_eff`.

* **For epistemes (Γ\_epist):**

  * `F` reads as **logical/semantic formality** (from prose to proof).
  * `G` reads as **domain span** (concepts, populations, conditions).
  * `R` reads as **evidential support** (replication quality, measurement integrity).
  * `CL` measures **semantic alignment** of merged constructs (terminology mapping, ontology bridges, calibration).

> **Agentness is separate (A.13).**
> Agency metrics (Agency‑CHR) **do not enter the skeleton by default**. They may act as a **contextual overlay** (e.g., to argue why a supervisory policy can maintain `R` across disturbances), but **never** to bypass **WLNK** or the **CL penalty**. Grade shifts should be modeled as **MHT** events when they create new capabilities.

#### B.3:4.6 - Scale discipline (CHR guard‑rails)

To prevent silent misuse:

* **Ordinal scales (F, CL):** never average or subtract; only `min`/`max`, thresholds, and monotone comparisons are valid operations.
* **Coverage scales (G):** use union/intersection in a declared domain space; do not “average” sets. If a numeric proxy is used (e.g., coverage ratio), it **must** be derived from a set operation, not vice versa.
* **Ratio scales (R):** may be combined with `min`, `max`, or **explicitly justified** conservative functions; do not add R’s from different contexts without normalization of `K` (assumptions).

#### B.3:4.7 - What improves the tuple (action-pattern overview)

B.3 remains neutral about *how* improvement happens, but for didactic clarity:

* **Raise F:** formalize narratives (specifications, machine‑checked models).
* **Raise G:** enlarge supported span (new test regimes, new populations) with adequate evidence.
* **Raise R:** replicate, calibrate, tighten measurement error, reduce bias.
* **Raise CL:** reconcile vocabularies, align units, formalize mappings, verify interface Standards.

Each of these corresponds to recognizable **Transformer roles** and KD‑CAL moves (design‑time); their **run‑time** counterparts are covered by Γ\_time (phase evidence) and Γ\_work (cost of obtaining assurance).

### B.3:4.8 - Prohibition (normative) — F–G–R is not a CharacteristicSpace

Do not treat `⟨F,G,R⟩` as a `U.CharacteristicSpace` and do not define geometric **trajectories** over it. Use **ESG** for episteme state and the **assurance‑trace** hooks for trends in assurance tuples.

### B.3:4.9 - Assurance consequence for unsupported `CausalityLadderRung` climb

`B.3` consumes `CausalUseSupportVerdict` from `C.28` when an assurance claim depends on causal-use support:

```text
CausalUseSupportVerdict = supported | bounded | unsupported | abstain
```

`CausalAssuranceTupleTrigger` is narrower than local causal-use repair. A local `C.28` downgrade, redirection to a named receiving relation, or abstain disposition does not require a new `B.3` assurance tuple by itself. Create or update a `B.3` tuple only when the causal-use claim is assurance-bearing, publication-bearing, release-bearing, or reused as an input to assurance, trust, certification, risk acceptance, or downstream selection. Exploratory causal wording, local causal wording repair, or a `C.28` cheap stop remains outside `B.3` until it changes assurance or publication posture.

Unsupported `CausalityLadderRung` climb lowers, blocks, or abstains from `R` for the affected causal-use claim. If `CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile.verdict = nonrealizable`, `B.3` lowers or blocks `R` for claims that require direct counterfactual-comparison sampling evidence. If `CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile.verdict = unknown`, direct-realization claims are unsupported, but identified, bounded, or simulation-only supported use may still be admissible when `C.28` declares the supported use and unsupported use.

Verdict consequences:

| `CausalUseSupportVerdict` | Assurance consequence | Admissible assurance wording |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supported` | The causal-use claim contributes to `R` only inside the named `CausalUseSupportStatement`, scope `G`, evidence support basis, and cited profile refs. | "Supported only for the declared causal use under the cited support basis, profile refs, and scope." |
| `bounded` | `R` is bounded to the declared admissible-use limit; assurance prose must name the bound, the `CausalUseSupportStatement`, and the `CausalUseUnsupportedStatement`, and must not imply unqualified causal support outside them. | "Bounded causal support for the declared regime, population, policy, model, or window; unsupported outside that bound." |
| `unsupported` | The causal-use claim cannot raise `R`; it becomes `CausalUseUnsupportedStatement`, is downgraded, removed, or blocks the assurance claim when the causal use is necessary. | "Causal use unsupported for this assurance claim; use association/metric/simulation-only wording or block the causal assurance claim." |
| `abstain` | No causal-use conclusion contributes to `R`; the assurance tuple either proceeds only on named non-causal grounds or abstains from the affected causal claim. | "No causal-use conclusion is used; assurance proceeds only on named non-causal grounds or abstains from this causal claim." |

What changes in practice: assurance prose cannot say "high confidence that the policy caused improvement" when the evidence path only supports association or simulation-only counterfactual output; the unsupported causal step must degrade, abstain, or block the causal-use claim.

What this does not authorize: `B.3` does not determine the `CausalityLadderRung`, estimand, causal identification, evidence design, or realizability profile; it applies assurance consequences to the support verdict supplied by `C.28` and the evidence path supplied by `A.10`.

### B.3:5 Proof obligations (attach these when producing an Assurance tuple)

These obligations refine the generic Proof Kit from **B.1.1 §6** for **assurance** outputs. Each Γ‑flavour that emits an *Assurance(H, C | K, S)* tuple MUST attach the applicable obligations below.

#### B.3:5.1 - Common obligations (all Γ‑flavours)

* **ASS‑CLM (Typed claim & context).**
  State the **claim** `C` (what is being assured), the **context** `K` (assumptions, environment), and the **scope** `S ∈ {design, run}`.

* **ASS‑SCA (Scale discipline).**
  Declare the **scale kind** used for each characteristic (F ordinal, G coverage, R ratio) and confirm that all operations are **admissible** for that kind (no averaging of ordinals; G via set/coverage ops).

* **ASS‑WLNK (Weakest‑link evidence).**
  Identify the **cutset** (node or edge set) that caps F/G/R for the claim (the proof spine for epistemes, the structural or assurance bottleneck for systems).

* **ASS‑CL (Congruence path).**
  Identify the **relevant integration path(s)** and record `CL_min` used in the penalty `Φ(CL_min)`.

* **ASS‑MAN (SCR).**
  Produce a **SCR** listing all contributing nodes and edges with `(F, G, R)` and `CL` values, their **DesignRunTag**, and Evidence Graph Ref (A.10). If order or time affect the claim, include the **OrderSpec** or **TimeWindow** identifiers from **B.1.4**.

* **ASS‑MONO (Declared monotone characteristics).**
  List the characteristics along which local improvement cannot reduce the aggregate (this supports future evolution, B.4).

#### B.3:5.2 - Γ\_sys (systems) — additional obligations

* **CORE‑BIC (Interface congruence).**
  Reference the **Boundary‑Inheritance Standard** (BIC) from **B.1.2** and record any interface mismatches; these contribute to `CL_min`.

* **CORE‑ENV (Operating envelope).**
  Specify the domain used for **G** (e.g., load–temperature region) and how coverage is computed (set union constrained by support).

#### B.3:5.3 - Γ\_epist (epistemes) — additional obligations

* **EPI‑SPN (Entailment spine).**
  Identify the **premise/lemma spine** for the claim; `R_raw = min R_i` is taken along this spine, not over arbitrary satellites.

* **EPI‑MAP (Semantic mapping congruence).**
  Point to the **vocabulary/ontology mappings** used; their verification status sets the **CL** values on the integration edges.

#### B.3:5.4 - Γ\_ctx and Γ\_method (order‑sensitive) — additional obligations

* **CTX‑ORD (OrderSpec).**
  Attach the partial or total order `σ` and any **join‑soundness** conditions (types, pre/post‑conditions).
  (See B.1.4 for NC‑1..3 invariants; B.1.5 adds duration/capability typing.)

#### B.3:5.5 - Γ\_time (temporal) — additional obligations

* **TIME‑COV (Coverage & identity).**
  Show that `PhaseOf` intervals cover the declared window without overlap for the **same carrier**; justify any gap/overlap explicitly.

> **Note on Γ\_work.**
> Resource spending and efficiency live in **Γ\_work**. Their *measurement integrity* can influence **R** for a claim (e.g., if a reliability figure depends on calibrated energy input), but **costs themselves are not assurance**; keep them in Γ\_work and cite their **measurement assurance** as inputs here.

### B.3:6 - Archetypal grounding (worked examples)

#### B.3:6.1 - System archetype — **Battery pack safety claim**

* **Claim `C`:** *Pack P meets discharge current L with thermal safety margin δ in environment K.*
* **Context `K`:** Ambient ≤ 35 °C; airflow ≥ X; duty cycle Y. Scope `S = run`.
* **Graph:** Cells `ComponentOf` modules `ComponentOf` pack; BIC exposes main power and thermal interface.
* **Inputs:**

  * `F` per node: module spec F2, cell test F1 → `F_eff = F1`.
  * `G`: operating envelope regions; union constrained by supported test regimes.
  * `R`: per‑module reliability from test data; cutset is **hot‑spot path** near weakest cell.
  * `CL`: interface congruence (sensor calibration CL2; thermal contact CL1).
* **Aggregation:**

  * `R_raw = min R_i` along the thermal cutset.
  * `R_eff = max(0, R_raw − Φ(CL_min=CL1))`.
  * `G_eff`: union of supported (L,T) rectangles, dropping regions lacking validated thermal data.
  * `F_eff = min(F_cell=F1, F_module=F2) = F1`.
* **SCR:** Evidence for calibration, test campaigns, BIC.
* **Improvement path:** raise `CL` (better thermal interface verification), raise `F` (formal thermal model), add supported envelope → **R\_eff** and **G\_eff** increase monotonically.

#### B.3:6.2 - Episteme archetype — **Meta-analysis claim**

* **Claim `C`:** *Intervention X reduces outcome O by Δ on population P.*
* **Context `K`:** Inclusion/exclusion criteria, measurement protocol; `S = design`.
* **Graph:** Studies `MemberOf` evidence corpus; effect models `ConstituentOf` synthesis; mappings align different outcome scales.
* **Inputs:**

  * `F`: two RCTs at F3, one observational at F2 -> `F_eff = F2`.
  * `R`: per-study replication/quality -> weakest R on the entailment spine caps `R_raw`.
  * `CL`: mapping of scales (CL1 vs CL3).
  * `G`: populations union, but unsupported sub-populations are dropped.
* **Aggregation:**

  * `F_eff = F2` from the weakest study-design support in the synthesis.
  * `R_eff = max(0, min(R_RCT1, R_RCT2, R_OBS) - Φ(CL_min=CL1))`.
  * `G_eff`: union of supported sub-populations; out-of-scope groups excluded.
  * `CL_min = CL1` for scale mappings; record the mapping witness and weakest-link study in the SCR.
* **SCR:** Data provenance, scale mappings, bias assessment, and proof-term hash for the effect-model equivalence when it is used constructively.
* **Improvement path:** upgrade mapping verification to CL2/CL3; increase `F` via registered analysis plan; replicate lagging study.

#### B.3:6.3 - Order/Process archetype — **Manufacturing route assurance**

* **Claim `C`:** *Route R meets output defect rate ≤ ε.*
* **Context `K`:** Materials, equipment class; `S = run`.
* **Γ\_ctx records:** `σ` order; declared independent branches; join conditions at inspection.
* **Assurance:**

  * `R_raw = min R_step` along the **critical path** (includes inspection effectiveness).
  * Penalty from poor join soundness `CL_min`.
  * Improvement via faster but **verified** inspection (↑R\_step) or tighter join spec (↑CL).

#### B.3:6.4 - Temporal archetype — **Versioned model credibility**

* **Claim `C`:** *Model M predicts within ±δ over τ.*
* **Context `K`:** Data regime and drift tolerance; `S = run`.
* **Γ\_time records:** `PhaseOf` slices v1, v2, v3 covering `τ`.
* **Assurance:**

  * `R_raw = min(R_v1, R_v2, R_v3)`;
  * penalty if v2–v3 interface had low calibration congruence;
  * improvement via re‑calibration (↑CL) or new validation campaign (↑R\_v3).

### B.3:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC-B3.1** | An assurance result **SHALL** be a typed claim `Assurance(H, C &#124; K, S)` with `S ∈ {design, run}`. | Prevent scope drift and chimeras. |
| **CC-B3.2** | `F` **SHALL** be treated as **ordinal** (`min`/thresholds only); `G` as **coverage** (set/measure union constrained by support); `R` as **ratio** (`min` + conservative operations). | Preserve scale integrity (CHR). |
| **CC-B3.3** | The **Congruence Level** `CL` **SHALL** live on **edges**; the penalty `Φ(CL)` **SHALL** be **monotone decreasing** and **bounded** (`R_eff ≥ 0`). | Make integration quality first-class. |
| **CC-B3.4** | `R_eff` **SHALL** be computed as `R_eff = max(0, min_i R_i - Φ(CL_min))` for the relevant integration paths, unless a stricter domain-specific rule is justified. | Enforce WLNK and penalize low-CL integrations. |
| **CC-B3.5** | `F_eff = min_i F_i`; `G_eff = SpanUnion({G_i})` constrained by support. | Prevent over-generalization. |
| **CC-B3.6** | An **Assurance SCR** **SHALL** be produced, listing node/edge values, Evidence Graph Ref, and any OrderSpec/TimeWindow identifiers, and **SHALL also display** the `describe(Object->GroundingHolon)` binding for the claim, the declared **CHR:ReferencePlane ∈ {world\|concept\|episteme}**, a separable **TA/VA/LA** evidence breakdown per **CC-KD-08**, decay/valid-until indicators on empirical bindings, and the **Epistemic-Debt** tally from **B.3.4**. | Provide auditability through A.10 without collapsing evidence families. |
| **CC-B3.7** | **Agency-CHR** values (A.13) **SHALL NOT** override WLNK or `Φ(CL)` penalties; if agency grade change alters capabilities, model it as a **Meta-Holon Transition**. | Preserve safety; keep agency separate. |
| **CC-B3.8** | Design-time and run-time assurance **SHALL NOT** be mixed in one tuple; compare them side by side if needed. | Avoid design-time and run-time mixing. |
| **CC-B3.9** | If an assurance claim depends on causal-use support, it **SHALL** consume `CausalUseSupportVerdict`, `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis`, and relevant profile refs from `C.28`/`A.10`; unsupported `CausalityLadderRung` climb **SHALL** degrade, block, or abstain rather than raising `R`. | Prevents assurance prose from certifying unsupported causal claims. |
| **CC-B3.10** | A local `C.28` downgrade, reroute, or abstain **SHALL NOT** be treated as a new assurance tuple trigger unless the claim is assurance-bearing, publication-bearing, release-bearing, or reused as an assurance input. | Keeps cheap causal triage from becoming assurance ceremony. |
| **CC-B3.11** | A conforming `B.3` use **SHALL NOT** treat a label, badge, dashboard tile, credential display, provenance mark, compliance-looking mark, model card, datasheet, data card, assurance document, attestation label, or generated confidence phrase as raising `F`, `G`, `R`, `CL`, readiness, safety, compliance, trust, release confidence, or assurance unless a typed `Assurance(H, C &#124; K, S)` claim and `A.10` evidence path name the claim, assurance use supported by the assurance tuple or relying context, scope, evaluation condition, evidence carriers, argument and support rationale, limitations, decay condition, reopen condition, and relying context. | Blocks visible authority-looking labels from supplying false assurance support. |
| **CC-B3.12** | When reliance on a source may materially change behavior, safety, release, compliance, public or protocol behavior, access, resource allocation, people/team status, operational action, or controlled-object regulation, the B.3 result **SHALL** provide a minimum reliance safety support record or explicitly reject, narrow, degrade, abstain, or reopen the attempted assurance use. The local Tech label `RelianceSafetyCase` **SHALL NOT** be used as a certificate, approval, gate, policy source, Core kind, release permission, or general safety-case ontology. | Keeps safety-bearing reliance support concrete without turning every source-looking item into a dossier or a new authority system. |

### B.3:8 - Anti‑patterns and repairs

| Anti‑pattern             | Symptom                                                    | Repair                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Averaging assurance**  | Mean of `R_i` reported as system reliability               | Use `min R_i` on the cutset, then apply `Φ(CL_min)`.                                                           |
| **Ordinal arithmetic**   | Averaging `F` or `CL` to produce “2.3”                     | Use `min`/`max` or thresholds; never average ordinals.                                                         |
| **Coverage as centroid** | Replacing `G` union with a single “typical point”          | Keep `G` as set/coverage; if a numeric proxy is needed, derive it from the set.                                |
| **Ignoring congruence**  | No penalty for low-CL mappings or interfaces                    | Assign `CL` to integration edges and apply `Φ(CL_min)`.                                                           |
| **DesignRunTag chimera**   | “One score” mixing blueprint and telemetry                 | Split into `S=design` and `S=run` tuples; compare explicitly.                                                  |
| **Agency override**      | Claiming higher assurance because a controller is “clever” | Agency may justify *how* improvements are achieved; it cannot remove WLNK or `Φ`.                              |
| **MemberOf as stock**    | Using `MemberOf` to sum reliabilities                      | Keep `MemberOf` for collections; reliability comes from the relevant **Γ** composition (e.g., Γ\_sys cutset). |
| **False assurance support** | Badge, dashboard color, credential display, compliance mark, provenance label, model card, datasheet, data card, assurance document, attestation label, or generated confidence phrase is used as an assurance claim. | Keep it as orientation or source pointer unless a typed assurance claim and `A.10` evidence path support the intended assurance use. |
| **Minimum reliance safety support record inflation** | Ordinary evidence, source-finding explanation, local CV, documentation, or reversible local calibration use is forced into a safety support record; or the support record is used as approval, release permission, gate passage, safety acceptance, or compliance proof. | State the trigger that makes B.3 live. If the trigger is absent, return to `A.10`, `E.17.EFP`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `E.19`, or the local relation. If the trigger is live, write only the minimum support record and contest/redress path needed for the named reliance use. |

### B.3:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Comparable, conservative, improvable.** The tuple ⟨F, G, R⟩ with **edge-scoped Congruence Level (`CL`) values** gives a compact, auditable view that improves monotonically under targeted actions (formalize, replicate, reconcile).
* **Cross‑scale coherence.** Works for assemblies and arguments, methods and histories, without leaking order/time/cost into structure.
* **Clear upgrade paths.** It is obvious **what to do** to raise each component (raise F/G/R locally or raise CL on the glue).

**Trade‑offs**

* **More explicit metadata.** You must state scale kinds, cutsets, and mapping congruence; this is intentional transparency.
* **Conservatism may feel pessimistic.** True synergy appears only via **MHT** or after raising CL—never by arithmetic optimism.

### B.3:10 - Rationale (informative)

B.3 distills mature post‑2015 practice across several fields into a single, small calculus:

* **Assurance by weakest link** reflects reliability engineering and safety cases in complex systems; composing claim support by minima prevents over‑statement.
* **Formality and verifiability** mirror advances in model‑based engineering and formal verification, where raising F turns subjective arguments into verifiable records.
* **Coverage as set/measure** follows evidence synthesis and validation practice that treat applicability as a domain region, not a scalar to “average.”
* **Congruence on edges** captures what meta‑analysis, interface control, and ontology alignment have repeatedly shown: integration quality is often the real bottleneck. Penalizing low‑CL is a principled way to prevent silent over‑confidence while rewarding verified reconciliation.
* **Assurance documentation, provenance, and release-status practice** treats labels, model cards, datasheets, C2PA provenance marks, SLSA and in-toto attestations, credential displays, generated confidence phrases, and dashboards as scoped documentation or source pointers, not automatic assurance claims. B.3 adopts claim, argument, and evidence discipline and scoped assurance-documentation use, adapts model cards, datasheets, data cards, attestations, provenance marks, dashboards, and generated confidence phrases as possible documentation or evidence inputs for a named assurance claim, and rejects visible-label promotion into readiness, compliance, safety, trust, `R`, `F`, `G`, `CL`, or release confidence without a typed tuple and A.10 evidence path.

Action result from that safety-case and assurance-documentation practice basis: safety notes, compliance-looking labels, assurance documents, dashboards, provenance marks, model cards, datasheets, data cards, and generated confidence phrases do not become certificates, approvals, gates, safety acceptance, or assurance by appearance. The local B.3 result is one typed assurance claim or minimum reliance safety support record for the named reliance use, with `A.10` evidence path, assumptions, limitations, defeaters, residual uncertainty, monitoring or stop condition, contest and redress path, supported use, unsupported use, and reopen when evidence, context, profile, monitoring, or admissible challenge evidence materially changes the disposition.

This arrangement preserves **A.11 Parsimony** (few characteristics), aligns with **A.14/A.15** (clear separation of structure, order, time, cost, values), and leaves Context for domain‑specific refinements that do not break the invariants.

### B.3:11 - Relations

* **Builds on:** B.1 (Universal Γ), B.1.1 (Proof Kit), B.1.2 (Γ_sys & BIC), B.1.3 (Γ_epist & SCR), B.1.4 (Γ_ctx/Γ_time), A.12 (Transformer), A.14 (Mereology), A.15 (Strict Distinction), **C.13 (Compose‑CAL)**.
* **Coordinates with:** **E.14 (Human‑Centric Working‑Model)** for publication-facing assertion discipline and **B.3.5 (CT2R‑LOG)** for Working‑Model relation aliasing and grounding (`tv:*`, `validationMode`).
* **Coordinates with:** `C.28` for causal-use support verdicts, `CausalityLadderRung` support, identification profile refs and realizability profile refs, and supported causal use and unsupported causal use; `A.10` for the evidence graph path carrying causal support-basis refs.
* **Coordinates with:** `A.15` for work disposition and reliance disposition, `A.6` for mixed authority wording, `A.21` for `OperationalGate(profile)`, `GateDecision`, and `DecisionLogRef`, `A.20` for `ConstraintValidity` status or witness, and `A.15.1` for release or deployment work occurrence. B.3 only handles typed assurance use; labels and evidence pointers return to the exact neighboring source when assurance is not live.
* **Used by:** KD‑CAL action patterns (to plan improvements), B.4 (Evolution loops that raise F/G/R or CL over time).
* **Triggers:** B.2 (Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT): Recognizing Emergence and Re‑identifying Wholes) when genuine new capabilities emerge that change the applicable cutsets or envelopes.

> **One‑page takeaway.**
> Report assurance as **⟨F, G, R⟩** for a **typed claim** under explicit **context/scope**, and penalize by the **lowest edge-scoped Congruence Level (`CL`) value**.
> Improve assurance by raising **F**, **G**, **R**, or **CL**—and keep order, time, and cost in their own lanes.

### B.3:11a - Assurance posture for quantum-like claims

Quantum-like wording does not raise the claim-support requirement by default. A local `C.26` modeling note can remain lightweight when it only prevents a representational mistake and does not support action, close audit, certify readiness, or claim empirical superiority.

Action path:

1. Decide the claim-support requirement before building assurance machinery.
2. If the QL note only prevents a local misreading, keep it as QL-lite with ordinary evidence.
3. If the claim will be reused, state the exact FPF pattern, local stop condition, and evidence posture.
4. If the claim supports release, readiness, audit, compliance, assurance, or threshold-bearing action, build the B.3 assurance claim over named evidence carriers and scope.
5. If the claim says QL is better, faster, more accurate, or uniquely necessary, compare rival models, baseline, mechanism, scope, and loss.
6. State decay conditions and reopen conditions so an old QL-supported assurance claim does not silently stay current after probes, carriers, or scope change.

| Claim-support requirement | B.3 expectation | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local modeling note | No assurance tuple beyond the ordinary pattern and evidence note | QL-lite note with local stop |
| Reusable example or pattern-facing note | Name the exact FPF pattern, local stop condition, and evidence posture | Reusable example with source-support posture |
| Decision, release, audit, readiness, or compliance use | Provide F-G-R and congruence support, evidence carriers, confidence, rival explanations, and decay or reopen conditions | Assurance tuple and evidence path |
| Comparative superiority claim | Add rival-model comparison, baseline, mechanism, and scope limits | Bounded superiority claim or apply the neighboring FPF pattern that governs the live comparison |

Useful outputs:

- no B.3 action when QL is only a local representational lens;
- a compact bounded assurance claim statement when reuse is modest;
- a full assurance tuple only when consequence severity demands it;
- a rejected, narrowed, or withdrawn claim when evidence does not support the claimed assurance use or relying context.

### B.3:11b - C.29 MLA relation

> If a mathematical lens is used to support assurance, readiness, reliability, release confidence, safety, trust, or engineering justification, write the assurance support in `B.3` with the relevant evidence path and residual-use limits. A `C.29` output may be cited only as lens-adequacy support; mathematical elegance, validation posture, or a declared structure-preserving mapping does not raise assurance by itself. Evidence paths remain `A.10`; measurement construction and comparability remain `C.16`.
