## C.16 - Measurement & Metrics Characterization (MM‑CHR)

> **Status:** Stable
> **Type:** Pattern

**Use this pattern when.** Use C.16 when a value, sensor indication, score, rating, dashboard reading, or comparison is being treated as a measurement without a recoverable measurand, Characteristic, Scale, method, model, calibration basis, dated work, attributed value, uncertainty, time stance, or comparability basis.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Raw output, indication, actual subject state, measurement result, diagnosis, and criterion verdict collapse into one number; model and calibration assumptions disappear; uncertainty is laundered away; and a dashboard or evidence link is mistaken for work, result, assurance, or decision authority.

**What this buys.** One executable measurement account: exact measurand or subject, Characteristic and Scale, Unit and polarity when current, method, model, calibration, input and output quantities, uncertainty propagation, dated work with actual bindings, one measurement result, one C.2.1 result episteme, and bounded provenance and later use.

### C.16:1 - Intent (Normative)

**Name.** *Measurement & Metrics Characterization (MM‑CHR).*

**Use this when.** Use C.16 when a reading, score, rating, sensor indication, dashboard value, or claimed comparison must be made interpretable as a measurement. The working question is: what exact subject or measurand was measured, for which Characteristic and Scale, by which method and model, under which calibration and time stance, with what attributed value and uncertainty?

**What changes in practice.** Instead of carrying a number and a source link, the practitioner recovers a complete measurement chain: reusable specification, exact measurand, method, model, calibration basis, input and output quantities, dated measurement work, direct bindings, measurement result, one result episteme, and provenance. A reader can then tell what the reading supports and what still requires a diagnostic, criterion, assurance, causal, acceptance, or decision pattern.

**Not this pattern when.** Use A.17 for the Characteristic, A.18 for scale-operation legality, C.16.P while measurement wording is still ambiguous, A.19 for comparison or selection, C.28 for causal use, A.10/G.6 for provenance, B.3 for assurance, G.4 for an acceptance declaration, G.11 for currentness, and C.11 for a decision result. C.16 supplies none of those results by implication.

**Local designators.** `MeasurementSpecification`, `MeasurementMethod`, `MeasurementModel`, `MeasurementWork`, `MeasurementResult`, and `MeasurementResultEpisteme` name exact objects in one case; they are not new public U-kinds or universal relation types. `MeasurementMethod` is one exact `U.Method`; `MeasurementWork` is one dated `U.Work`; `MeasurementResultEpisteme` is one C.2.1 episteme.

**Compatibility with the retained measurement family.** `U.DHCMethod` remains the durable measurement-definition value that fixes the Characteristic, Scale, unit and polarity and cites the exact method and model. `U.Measure` remains the durable reading claim: when persisted, it is the C.2.1 result episteme that states the C.16 measurement result. `U.Unit` carries quantity-kind and conversion semantics when the Scale requires them. `U.EvidenceStub` is only a compact locator into A.10/G.6 provenance; it is not the measurement result, an evidence carrier, a work record, or a relation that establishes measurement.

### C.16:2 - Scope and result boundary (Normative)

C.16 governs the measurement-specific result algebra:

- one measurand or otherwise exact measurement subject;
- one Characteristic and one Scale, with Level or Coordinate and Unit when applicable;
- the reusable measurement specification, exact `U.Method`, measurement model, calibration requirements, and uncertainty treatment;
- dated measurement work with performer, actual bindings, resources, and time stance;
- the value or set of values attributed to the measurand together with relevant information, including uncertainty and interpretation basis; and
- direct comparability within the declared basis.

C.16 does not turn an instrument message, file, dashboard tile, ledger row, or evidence citation into a measurement result. It does not own the actual subject state, diagnosis, criterion verdict, acceptance action, assurance claim, causal conclusion, or decision. It introduces no universal measurement-result, work-result, evidence-use, common-scale, or criterion-participant relation.

### C.16:3 - Problem Frame

A measurement is often compressed to `subject → value`. That abbreviation hides the measurand, the quantity or characteristic intended to be measured, the model relating inputs to an output quantity, the calibration basis, the work occurrence, and the uncertainty carried into later use. It also makes raw instrument output, a displayed indication, an attributed measurement result, a diagnostic interpretation, and a criterion verdict look like one object.

The failure becomes visible when two readings are compared, when a detector output is treated as the state of the subject, or when a dashboard value is reused as evidence, assurance, acceptance, or decision authority. C.16 restores the measurement-specific objects before any receiving use is judged.

### C.16:4 - Forces

- **Interpretability vs convenience.** A compact value is easy to carry; a usable result needs its measurand, Characteristic, Scale, model, calibration, uncertainty, and time stance.
- **Model dependence vs objectivity rhetoric.** Measurement may use corrections, calibration coefficients, influence quantities, and inference. Hiding them does not make the result more direct.
- **Cross-domain reuse vs scale coercion.** Physics, software quality, architecture, survey, and judging cases need common discipline without one common scale.
- **Repeatability vs occurrence identity.** A reusable method and operation declaration do not establish that measurement work occurred or that actual participants were bound.
- **Result vs later interpretation.** A value attributed to a measurand is not by itself a diagnosis, conformance verdict, causal conclusion, assurance claim, or decision.

### C.16:5 - Solution — recover one complete measurement chain (Normative)

Start with one ordinary direct sentence:

> Dated measurement work `W` applied method `M` to measurand `x`, using model `f`, calibration basis `K`, and actual input bindings `X`, and obtained output quantity value `y` with stated uncertainty `u`; episteme `E` states that measurement result under its declared Characteristic, Scale, unit, time stance, and interpretation basis.

If any noun in that sentence cannot be grounded, return that exact gap rather than filling it with a generic result or evidence relation.

#### C.16:5.1 - Name the measurand and measurement subject

**M‑SUB‑1.** Name the measurand: the quantity or characteristic intended to be measured. When FPF uses a non-quantity Characteristic, name the exact subject and the Characteristic whose Scale position is being attributed.

**M‑SUB‑2.** Preserve arity. An entity Characteristic has one subject; a relation Characteristic has the exact ordered or unordered tuple required by A.17. A relation reading is not silently rewritten as a unary property of one participant.

**M‑SUB‑3.** Distinguish the measurand from the actual subject state. A measurement result attributes values under a method and model; it does not make the physical, social, architectural, or epistemic state identical to the result episteme.

#### C.16:5.2 - Fix Characteristic, Scale, unit, polarity, and time stance

**M‑CSLC‑1.** One `U.DHCMethod` binds exactly one Characteristic to exactly one Scale. A discrete reading names its Level; another reading names its Coordinate or value on that Scale.

**M‑CSLC‑2.** When units apply, name the quantity kind and presentation Unit. Conversions are admissible only when they preserve the quantity kind and the Scale supports the operation. Nominal and ordinal labels do not acquire interval or ratio arithmetic by being encoded as numbers.

**M‑CSLC‑3.** An ordered Scale declares polarity: higher-is-better, lower-is-better, or target-is-best. Polarity guides later interpretation; it is not an acceptance criterion or decision rule.

**M‑CSLC‑4.** State the time stance: instantaneous or as-observed at `T`, aggregated over window `W`, or another exact temporal basis. A later value does not silently replace an earlier result.

#### C.16:5.3 - Separate method, description, model, calibration, and work

**M‑METH‑1.** `MeasurementMethod` is one exact `U.Method`. Its `U.MethodDescription` may state generic participants, parameters, effects, and measurement conditions; it contains no actual-participant slots and does not claim that measurement occurred.

**M‑MODEL‑1.** `MeasurementModel` states how input quantities and influence quantities determine or constrain the output quantity. It names the model edition, assumptions, corrections, and domain of validity. A formula, software function, or signature is only a representation or declaration of that model until its exact governed object is recovered.

**M‑CAL‑1.** Name the calibration basis required for the use: reference standard or comparison basis, dated calibration work and result when current, calibration coefficients or corrections, applicable interval, and uncertainty contribution. A calibration certificate or ledger row cites these facts; it does not establish them by being stored.

**M‑WORK‑1.** `MeasurementWork` is one exact dated `U.Work`. First recover every actual performer's A.13 core for the measurement action, including the same obtaining assignment; then independently admit the Work under A.15.1 from its performance history, at least one obtaining `enactsMethod` relation, temporal extent, and at least one obtaining locally declared containing-system relation. Add F.6 afterward only when the measurement claim also needs precise assignment-bound attribution. Name the exact measurand through its direct subject relation or an A.6.1 operation-application binding. Name another enacted Method, resource, or concrete participant only when the measurement claim uses its independently obtaining relation or binding. A plan, compatible signature, method description, instrument type, or retained reference establishes none of those actual facts.

#### C.16:5.4 - Recover input quantities, output quantity, and uncertainty

**M‑IO‑1.** Name each actual input quantity used by the model, including indications, repeated observations, environmental or other influence quantities, reference values, calibration coefficients, and applied corrections when current. Name the exact output quantity whose value is attributed to the measurand. These are measurement-model roles, not a universal work input-output ontology.

**M‑UNC‑1.** State the uncertainty associated with the attributed value or values whenever it affects interpretation or use. Identify the contributing input uncertainties, correlations or covariance when relevant, propagation method, coverage or interval interpretation, and significant model inadequacy. An uncertainty number without its interpretation is not complete.

**M‑UNC‑2.** Propagation follows the declared measurement model. Linearized propagation, sampling, interval, set-valued, or another method is admissible only under its own assumptions. Combining provenance pointers is not uncertainty propagation, and more cited grounds do not monotonically guarantee lower uncertainty.

#### C.16:5.5 - State one measurement result and one result episteme

**M‑RES‑1.** `MeasurementResult` is the value or set of values attributed to the measurand together with relevant information needed to interpret them. At minimum, recover the measurand, Characteristic, Scale, attributed value or values, Unit when relevant, uncertainty, method, model, calibration basis, time stance, and exact measurement work.

**M‑RES‑2.** `MeasurementResultEpisteme` is one exact C.2.1 episteme. Its ClaimGraph states the C.16 result, subject, interpretation basis, polarity or domain status when current, and uncertainty. `U.Measure` may designate this retained reading claim. The episteme is not the measurand, actual subject state, raw output, indication, diagnosis, or criterion verdict.

**M‑RES‑3.** When exact work and governed actual changes first establish the episteme's identity and that inception matters, A.15.PROD supplies the local entity-identity inception claim. C.16 does not introduce a work-to-result relation.

#### C.16:5.6 - Keep comparability and scoring bounded

**M‑CMP‑1.** Direct comparability is conservative: two readings cite the same `U.DHCMethodRef`, Characteristic, Scale and Unit semantics, compatible model and calibration regime, and a compatible time or population basis. Similar labels or units are insufficient.

**M‑CMP‑2.** Cross-template conversion, normalization, scoring, aggregation, comparison, selection, or cross-context transport names its exact subject pattern, method, declaration, Bridge, and loss or uncertainty consequence. C.16 does not mint a common scale or corpus-wide migration relation.

**M‑SCORE‑1.** A Score is another declared Scale reading. Its scoring method and actual application remain under their direct Method, Work, and operation-binding patterns. A score does not overwrite its source measurement results.

#### C.16:5.7 - Route provenance and later use outward

`U.EvidenceStub` may carry a type-of-ground and identifier that lead to the exact A.10/G.6 provenance path. The path can cite the method description, model, calibration, work, inputs, output, result episteme, source publications, and transformations. Neither the stub nor a graph edge establishes those objects or their obtaining relations.

A later comparison, diagnosis, criterion evaluation, acceptance action, or decision is separate dated work. It uses the result episteme through an exact premise, reference, operation-argument, decision-use, or other direct relation. Currentness belongs to G.11; bounded reliance to A.10 or B.3 under their entry conditions.

#### C.16:5.8 - Lexical and neighboring-pattern discipline

Use **measurand**, **measurement subject**, **Characteristic**, **Scale**, **Level**, **Coordinate**, **value**, **Unit**, **measurement method**, **measurement model**, **calibration**, **uncertainty**, **measurement work**, and **measurement-result episteme** for their exact jobs. Plain-register *metric*, *reading*, *score*, and *output* are acceptable after first-use mapping. Do not use *measurement result*, *evidence*, *validation*, or *verification* as umbrella terms for several governed objects.

**Key relations.** C.16 uses A.17 and A.18 for Characteristic and Scale legality; A.6.1 for declaration-local positions and operation bindings; A.15.1 for admitted Work and its performing System; and F.6 for the exact obtaining assignment under which that System performed. If claim-bearing source wording still says only “role,” use E.10.ROLE first, then use A.2 or A.2.1 only when an exact local system-role kind, classification, or assignment has actually been recovered. C.2.1 covers the result episteme; A.10/G.6 provenance; G.11 currentness; B.3 assurance; and the exact pattern for the next diagnosis, acceptance, causality, comparison, selection, or decision question.

### C.16:6 - Scale-type admissibility quick reference (Informative)

> **Didactic note.** This table is a memory aid for engineers and managers. It does **not** introduce new admissibility rules. Normative admissibility of operations by scale type is governed by **A.18 (CSLC)** and, where mechanized in CG‑frames, by the relevant admissibility profiles.
> If any row below conflicts with A.18, treat it as an illustrative example and follow A.18.

| Scale type   | Comparisons    | Location          | Differences        | Ratios                   | Admissible summaries                                  | Typical unsupported anti-patterns                                   |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nominal**  | =, ≠           | mode, frequencies | —                  | —                        | counts, proportions                                   | averaging labels; ordering categories without a declared order      |
| **Ordinal**  | <, =, > (rank) | median, quantiles | **not meaningful** | —                        | order‑respecting summaries (median rank, percentiles) | arithmetic mean of ranks; variance on ranks; linear blends of ranks |
| **Interval** | <, =, >        | mean location     | Δ meaningful       | ratio **not** meaningful | mean, sd of **differences**, correlation              | ratio claims (“twice as hot” in °C); geometric mean                 |
| **Ratio**    | <, =, >        | mean location     | Δ meaningful       | ratios meaningful        | arithmetic/geometric means, cv, growth rates          | adding heterogeneous units; log on nonpositive values               |

**Reminders (informative; see A.18 for normative rules).**
G‑1 (Order). On ordinal, transforms should be **monotone**.
G‑2 (Differences). On interval or ratio, **Δ** is meaningful; on ordinal or nominal, it is undefined.
G‑3 (Ratios). Only ratio Scales admit **x/y** semantics; interval, ordinal, or nominal do not.
G‑4 (Unit coherence). Interval or ratio arithmetic presumes compatible units (or a declared conversion).
G‑5 (Target polarity). If polarity is targeted, comparisons use distance‑from‑target semantics as declared by the relevant subject pattern, template, and cited method or mechanism.

*(These rules line up with the MM‑CHR exposition of CSLC and term discipline; A.17 fixes the lexical side.)*

### C.16:7 - Provenance and use semantics (Normative)

#### C.16:7.1 - What an EvidenceStub is and is not

`U.EvidenceStub` is an optional compact locator from the reading claim to an exact provenance path. It may identify a source publication, calibration record, instrument output, model edition, work occurrence, transformation, or other ground, but A.10/G.6 govern the path and its citations.

- The stub is not evidence in the abstract, a result, an instrument output, a work record, an assurance claim, or a provenance-as-result object.
- Several stubs form a list of locators, not a measurement algebra. Their union is not uncertainty propagation and does not guarantee stronger warrant.
- A provenance edge may be asserted only after its direct source relation, work fact, participation, production, representation, or citation relation is independently established.
- A later user states the exact relied-on claim and local `RelianceDisposition`; material reliance or an assurance claim enters B.3. Mere availability, citation, or graph membership does not establish actual use.

### C.16:8 - Measurement-result boundaries (Normative)

Keep the following objects distinct even when one carrier displays several of them:

| Object | Governing question |
| --- | --- |
| Raw instrument output | What signal, bytes, count, image, trace, or other emitted entity exists? |
| Indication | What displayed or decoded value did the instrument provide under its indication semantics? |
| Actual subject state | What obtains for the physical, social, architectural, or epistemic subject independently of the record? |
| Measurement result | What value or values are attributed to the measurand, with relevant method, model, calibration, uncertainty, and time information? |
| Measurement-result episteme | What durable C.2.1 claim states that result and its interpretation basis? |
| Diagnosis or causal conclusion | What later domain interpretation is supported under its own method and result algebra? |
| Criterion or acceptance verdict | Did the exact criterion application return pass, fail, or unknown? |
| Decision result | What did separate C.11 decision work decide? |

The carrier, dashboard, ledger, criterion clause, and evidence path may represent or cite several rows. None collapses their identities or establishes another row by presence alone.

### C.16:8.3 - Archetypal Grounding

**Calibrated detector receiver.** The detector emits raw counts. Its processing yields an indication of `41.8 kPa`. The measurand is gas pressure at port P over the stated sampling window; Characteristic is Pressure; Scale is a ratio quantity scale; Unit is kPa. Measurement model `PressureModel-4` uses counts, reference offset, temperature, and calibration coefficients as inputs and pressure as output. Dated measurement work names its performer, detector, port, resources, bindings, calibration basis, and uncertainty propagation. The C.16 result attributes `41.8 kPa ± 0.6 kPa` to the measurand under that basis; one C.2.1 episteme states it. The raw counts, displayed indication, actual pressure, result episteme, a later leak diagnosis, and a pressure-limit verdict remain different objects.

**Internal-combustion-engine test bench.** One dated test-bench work occurrence binds the engine, dynamometer, fuel batch, ambient conditions, method, model, and calibration records. Torque, exhaust temperature, and emissions are three Characteristics with separate Scales and result epistemes; their input quantities, output quantities, covariance where relevant, and uncertainties remain separately recoverable. Aggregation work may later construct a declared performance summary, and evaluation work may apply an emissions criterion. Neither the summary nor the pass/fail verdict is the torque or emissions measurement result.

**Architecture coupling.** The measurand is the exact ordered module pair under a declared dependency census window, not either module alone. The Characteristic is Coupling on an ordinal Scale. The method description defines generic dependency classes; dated work binds the actual codebase edition and pair. The result episteme states the Level and basis. A later release decision may rely on it, but the dashboard tile and decision record do not establish the census work.

### C.16:9 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias | Symptom | Correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number-as-fact | A displayed value lacks measurand, Characteristic, Scale, model, calibration, uncertainty, or time stance. | Rebuild the complete C.16 chain. |
| Instrument realism | Raw output or indication is asserted as the actual subject state. | Separate output, indication, attributed result, and subject state. |
| Uncertainty laundering | A point estimate is carried forward while model and calibration uncertainty disappear. | Recover input uncertainties, correlations, propagation, and interpretation. |
| Dashboard authority | A tile or score is reused as diagnosis, assurance, acceptance, or decision authority. | Route the later use to the exact patterns for its Work, result, provenance, currentness, and reliance claims. |
| Common-scale pressure | Distinct scales are normalized merely because comparison is desired. | Require an exact transformation and receiving comparison pattern; otherwise preserve incomparability. |

### C.16:10 - Conformance Checklist (Normative)

1. **Subject:** one exact measurand or measurement subject is named, with correct entity or relation arity.
2. **CSLC:** Characteristic, Scale, Level or Coordinate, Unit when current, polarity, and time stance are explicit.
3. **Method/model:** the exact `U.Method`, MethodDescription boundary, measurement model edition, inputs, output quantity, assumptions, and validity domain are recoverable.
4. **Calibration:** applicable calibration work/result, reference basis, coefficients or corrections, validity interval, and uncertainty contribution are cited when required.
5. **Work:** every actual performer has the A.13 core; the dated `U.Work` is independently admitted under A.15.1; F.6 is added afterward only when precise assignment-bound attribution is current. The exact measurand relation or A.6.1 binding is present; further enacted Methods, resources, or participant bindings are present only when the measurement claim uses them.
6. **Result:** one C.16 measurement result attributes value or values to the measurand with uncertainty and relevant information; one C.2.1 episteme states it.
7. **Separation:** raw output, indication, actual subject state, result, result episteme, diagnosis, verdict, and decision are not collapsed.
8. **Comparability:** direct or transformed comparison names its exact basis and does not upgrade the Scale or mint a common scale.
9. **Provenance/use:** A.10/G.6 provenance, G.11 currentness, bounded reliance, assurance, and later work remain under their subject patterns.
10. **Boundary:** no method description, plan, signature, carrier, ledger row, evidence edge, or stored reference is used to infer actual participation, work, or result identity.

### C.16:11 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

- **Template as occurrence.** A reusable `U.DHCMethod`, model, signature, or calibration procedure is treated as proof that work occurred. Ground dated work and actual bindings.
- **Generic result field.** A record has `result=...` without saying whether it is output, indication, measurement result, diagnosis, verdict, or decision. Name the direct result kind and governor.
- **Evidence algebra.** Evidence locators are unioned as though idempotence or count determined uncertainty or warrant. Use measurement-model uncertainty propagation and exact A.10/B.3 reliance separately.
- **Scale drift.** A template id survives changed Scale, model, unit, or calibration semantics. Publish a successor and state the relation; do not mutate historical readings.
- **Arithmetic on ordinal.** Encoded levels are averaged or ratio-compared. Stay with order-preserving operations or introduce a separately governed scoring method and Scale.
- **Multi-Characteristic stuffing.** One reading carries a vector while pretending to be one measurement. Create separate results and declare any later aggregation.
- **Result-to-verdict shortcut.** A value inside a tolerance is called accepted without performed criterion evaluation. Ground the separate evaluation work, exact clause application, verdict episteme, and later decision.

### C.16:13 - Consequences

**Benefits.** Measurement results become interpretable and reusable without pretending to be raw reality or later judgment. A practitioner can inspect the measurand, Scale, method, model, calibration, work, uncertainty, episteme, and provenance, then enter the smallest pattern for the next question for comparison, diagnosis, acceptance, assurance, causality, or decision.

**Trade-offs.** The chain is longer than a dashboard field. Model assumptions, calibration status, and uncertainty can make a formerly crisp number conditional or set-valued. That cost is the information needed to avoid false precision and hidden result substitution.

**Failure containment.** Missing model validity, stale calibration, ungrounded work, absent actual bindings, or unreported uncertainty narrows or blocks the measurement claim. It does not authorize a generic evidence, result, or acceptance relation as fallback.

### C.16:14 - Rationale

Measurement is not merely reading a carrier. It is performed work under a method and model that attributes one or more values to a measurand and supplies the information required to interpret those values. That architecture explains why indication, actual subject state, measurement result, result episteme, diagnosis, and verdict must remain distinct.

### C.16:14.1 - SoTA-Echoing

Source qualification was checked against the publishers' current surfaces on 2026-07-30. It remains qualified through 2027-07-30 unless an edition, amendment, correction, Recommendation status, or normative definition changes earlier. External terms guide the bounded C.16 rules named below; no source imports its ontology wholesale or establishes a measurement, work occurrence, result, episteme, calibration fact, or later-use relation.

### C.16:15 - Relations - Placement *(Informative)*
**Architecture measurement boundary.** `C.32.P2S`, `C.32.PAD`, and `C.32.ADA` may cite C.16 readings only after the characteristic, bearer, scale, coordinate, value, unit when relevant, and admissible use are declared. C.16 readings do not become architecture characteristics, decision criteria, eval programs, evidence, gates, or decision authority by themselves.

**Structural-information measurement boundary.** `C.33`, `C.34`, and `C.35` may name captured structure, lost structure, similarity, preservation, entropy, epiplexity estimate, compression, generated-carrier adequacy, or search-output context. When any of those become a value, score, coordinate, threshold, dashboard reading, or eval result, state the measurement construction and admissible-use assertions under the exact C.16 and evaluation/criteria predicates, with their subject patterns used as locators.

**Precision-restoration relation.** `C.16.P` is the first-stage wording-use restoration pattern for characteristic, scale, coordinate, score, metric, axis, dimension, and related characterization wording when the measurement object is not yet recoverable. C.16 resumes after the measurand or subject, Characteristic, Scale, value, method, model, calibration, work, uncertainty, result episteme, or exact non-C.16 governor has been recovered.
**C.27 temporal-claim relation.**

- C.27 may flag: a rate/rate-change reading whose admissible use depends on admissible measurement construction, evidence, sampling window, or finite-difference method.
- This pattern keeps: measurand and measurement-subject identity, method, model, calibration, input/output quantities, uncertainty, dated work, measurement result, result episteme, comparability basis, units, sampling window, and provenance routing.
- Non-admissible use: a rate-change label is not a measurement template, and temporal words such as velocity, acceleration, throughput, cadence, or recovery speed are not admissible measures by themselves.
- Neighboring-pattern use: when load-bearing, the claim cites `baseCharacteristicRef`, the relevant measure reference, sampling window, construction method such as `DHCMethodRef`, and `C16RouteRef`; C.27 keeps only the temporal-claim adequacy question.

**C.28 causal-use relation.** C.16 governs measurement construction, result interpretation, uncertainty, and direct comparability. C.28 governs the causal-use relation when the same result episteme is used to claim effect, intervention success, causal fairness, policy optimality, counterfactual comparison, off-policy causal evaluation, causal-RL evaluation, or causal method superiority. A C.16-admissible measurement result is therefore not by itself admissible for causal use under C.28.

**Evidence, currentness, and assurance.** Use A.10 and G.6 for source recovery and provenance for the exact method, model, calibration, Work, inputs, result episteme, and later use. Use G.11 for currentness and B.3 for assurance when its threshold is met. Evidence, provenance, currentness, and assurance do not by themselves establish the C.16 measurement result.

**Kernel.** MM‑CHR *imports* the canonical Characteristic vocabulary and the CSLC discipline fixed by A.17 and A.18; it does not redefine them. CharacteristicSpace reasoning (for change) lives in the patterns that consume MM‑CHR readings.

**Using patterns.** KD‑CAL, Arch‑CAL, G.4, and other consumers cite C.16 measurement-result epistemes and then ground their own comparison, evaluation, acceptance, aggregation, or decision work. They do not produce a measurement merely by naming a template, score field, criterion, or evidence profile.

**Unification (F‑cluster).** External standards (e.g., ISO 80000 quantity types; W3C SOSA/SSN observable properties; QUDT units/quantity kinds) are related via Concept‑Set rows and Bridges; MM‑CHR treats those alignments as context supplied by F‑patterns, not as local re‑definitions.

### C.16:15a - Measurement and probe note for quantum-like readings

Use C.16 first when the live object is a sensor reading, survey response, dashboard value, score, probe result, or state coordinate. Noise, probability, discreteness, gaming, or difficult interpretation does not by itself make a case quantum-like.

Recover the ordinary measurement chain first:

1. name the exact measurand or subject, Characteristic, Scale, value or Level, Unit, polarity, and time stance;
2. separate reusable method and model from dated work and actual bindings;
3. name input quantities, output quantity, calibration basis, uncertainty propagation, and one measurement-result episteme;
4. distinguish emitted output, indication, actual subject state, measurement result, result episteme, diagnosis, criterion verdict, and decision; and
5. attach provenance through A.10/G.6 and state the exact supported and unsupported later uses.

Only after that repair ask whether the probe order, frame, publication, or export changes the state or the inferences that remain admissible. If it does, C.26 may govern that residual contextual or probe-order question. If it does not, remain in C.16 and the ordinary evidence, assurance, or receiving-use patterns.

Minimum probe note:

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Measurand and Characteristic | What exact subject quantity or characteristic is intended to be measured? |
| Scale and time stance | On what Scale and Unit, at what time or window, is the value attributed? |
| Method, model, calibration | What reusable method/model and applicable calibration basis govern the reading? |
| Work and bindings | Which dated work, performer, resources, and actual arguments participated? |
| Inputs, output, uncertainty | Which model inputs determine the output quantity, and how is uncertainty propagated? |
| Result episteme | Which C.2.1 episteme states the attributed value and interpretation basis? |
| Boundary | Which raw output, indication, subject state, diagnosis, verdict, or decision remains separate? |
| Use | Which exact later use is supported, degraded, deferred, or unsupported? |

### C.16:15b - C.29 mathematical-lens use relation

If a mathematical lens depends on a measurement, recover the C.16 measurand, Scale, model, calibration, work, uncertainty, result episteme, and comparability basis first. C.29 may then state the lens-use admissibility claim; it does not construct the measurement, make values comparable, or provide provenance. A.10/G.6 retain provenance and B.3 retains assurance.
