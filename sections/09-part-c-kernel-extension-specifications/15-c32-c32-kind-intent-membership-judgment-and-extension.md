## C.3.2 - Kind Intent, Membership Judgment, and Extension

> **Type:** Local kind declaration and classification pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless a section is explicitly informative

### C.3.2:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when repeated typed reasoning needs one explicit local-kind criterion, when one exact entity or non-entity value must be judged against that criterion in one context slice, or when a named use needs a representation of all candidates currently judged `true`.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A kind is confused with the document that declares it, a measurement or schema label creates membership, missing information becomes `false`, a mathematical set becomes ontology, or a guard decision rewrites the classification.

**What this buys.** A practitioner can state an ordinary result, pin the declaration edition and slice when reliance requires it, distinguish `true`, `false`, and `unknown`, and materialize an extension only for a receiving query or review. A manager can separately plan higher declaration formality, stronger assurance for a relied-on classification assertion, or a different claim scope without treating those changes as one ladder.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** One local-kind classification use: an exact candidate, local kind, `KindSignature` edition, context slice, and judgment value.

**First useful move.** Write the readable result first: `Pump #14 counts as a cooling pump in this plant slice because it satisfies the declared cooling-pump criterion.` Cite the measurement only when the receiving use relies on that support. Create a reusable `KindSignature` only for repeated use, and materialize `KindExtension` only for a named set-consuming use.

**Not this pattern when.** Use the direct subject pattern to establish the candidate and the qualities, relations, or construction that make the criterion hold; A.14 for membership in a collection or collective; C.3.3 for cross-context use; C.29 when a mathematical representation changes a claim-bearing use; and `E.24.UK` for durable public U-kind admission.

### C.3.2:1 - Problem Frame

A local kind can support useful typed reasoning without becoming a public FPF U-kind. Its intent may need a reusable declaration; one candidate may need a current judgment; and a query may need a set representation of true candidates. Those are different objects. The candidate's governed world-side or value-side features settle the criterion when they are available for evaluation. Evidence can support a claim about those features, but a record, carrier, observation, or proof does not manufacture them. The pattern is concept-level and notation-neutral: it requires no particular ontology language, schema technology, rule engine, or programming type system.

### C.3.2:2 - Problem

The shorthand `MemberOf(e,k,slice)` is unsafe for this problem because readers can take it as an A.14 collection relation, an ontic classification-relation occurrence, a three-valued evaluation, a database lookup, or a guard. Likewise, `U.EntitySet(slice)` makes a set representation look like an admitted entity kind. Deterministic-looking notation then carries the wrong ontology. C.3.2 restores an explicit declaration, a judgment, and an optional representation while leaving candidate identity and direct features with their actual governors.

### C.3.2:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Readable use vs reusable declaration | One case should stay ordinary, while repeated classification needs a stable criterion and assumptions. |
| Direct feature vs evidence | Candidate features make the criterion hold; evidence only supports an assertion about them. |
| False vs unknown | Known criterion failure differs from unavailable evidence, missing dependency, or out-of-domain input. |
| Intent vs extension | A declaration can stay fixed while candidate state or the selected slice changes the true-candidate set. |
| Set use vs ontology | A query may need a set without creating a collection holon, direct relation occurrence, or `U.EntitySet`. |
| Local kind vs public kind | A project kind can be useful without durable FPF U-kind admission. |
| Scope vs evaluation input | Claims may be scoped; the kind is not. The context slice is an input to classification. |

### C.3.2:4 - Four Objects, Not One

| Object | Meaning | Identity and owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| local `U.Kind` and order | The context-local kind and any `U.SubkindOf` links used by typed reasoning. | C.3 and C.3.1; not this declaration or a public-kind admission. |
| `KindSignature` | A `U.Signature` declaration episteme whose exact `EntityOfConcern` is the local kind. | A.6.0 and C.2.1 govern the signature episteme and its editions. It is not the kind or another root U-kind. |
| classification judgment | One evaluation of the declared criterion for an exact candidate, kind, signature edition, and context slice, returning `true`, `false`, or `unknown`. | C.3.2; it is not a direct relation occurrence or claim-status value by default. |
| `KindExtension(k, slice)` | An optional set-valued representation of the declared candidate values whose judgment is `true` for the pinned signature edition and slice. | Local calculation unless the representation changes a claim-bearing use, when C.29 governs it. |

Scope is not a fifth object attached to the kind. A `KindSignature` episteme may have its own `U.ClaimScope`; a separate classification assertion has the scope of that assertion; and `U.ContextSlice` remains an explicit evaluation input.

### C.3.2:5 - KindSignature Declaration

Author a reusable `KindSignature` only when a named receiving use needs the criterion and assumptions to persist across more than one classification.

Its claim content declares:

- the exact local kind that is its `EntityOfConcern`;
- the candidate `ValueKind`: the direct kind or value interpretation admitted as candidate input;
- the membership criterion in terms of direct governed candidate qualities, relations, constructive grounding, or other features;
- the exact `U.ContextSlice` conditions under which the criterion can be evaluated;
- the effective `U.ReferenceScheme`;
- named assumptions, dependencies, standards, versions, units, and temporal policy;
- its `U.Formality`;
- an optional `ExtentRule` stating how repeated candidate evaluations feed an extension when a varying extension is current.

In A.6.0 terms, `SubjectKind` is the broad candidate kind and `RangedValueKind` is the finite judgment value kind `{true, false, unknown}`. `ExtentRule` is declaration content, not a new ontic relation. Formality characterizes the declaration episteme—not the local kind, candidate, candidate value, judgment truth, or extension. A claim that relies on the signature content evaluates that dependency on its own F–G–R support path; raising signature formality does not upgrade an unrelated claim.

A changed membership criterion, evaluation-domain declaration, `EntityOfConcern` referent, or effective reference scheme identifies another `U.Signature` episteme edition. C.3.1 separately decides whether the same local kind continues across that declaration change.

### C.3.2:6 - One Candidate Judgment

For exposition, this pattern uses:

`J(candidate, kind, signatureEdition, slice) ∈ {true, false, unknown}`

This is local notation for an evaluation result, not a newly admitted U-kind, an A.14 `MemberOf` occurrence, a direct classification relation, or an evidence relation. Evaluation is reproducible: fixed four inputs and unchanged governed candidate facts yield the same result. The slice names concrete versions and an explicit temporal selector; unqualified `latest` or `current` is not an evaluation input.

1. **Recover the candidate first.** An entity candidate is already individuated under its direct pattern. A non-entity value keeps the identity, unit, scale, and interpretation supplied by the pattern governing that value.
2. **Pin all four inputs.** Name the candidate, local kind, exact `KindSignature` edition, and exact `U.ContextSlice`.
3. **Evaluate direct governed features.** A satisfied criterion gives `true`; a known failed criterion gives `false`.
4. **Keep non-settlement visible.** Missing evidence, an unavailable declared dependency, or a candidate outside the declared evaluation domain gives `unknown`, not `false`.
5. **Separate support from satisfaction.** An observation, measurement result, source episteme, schema row, or evidence relation may support a classification assertion. It does not substitute for the candidate or make the criterion true merely by existing.
6. **Separate guard disposition.** A receiving guard checks scope coverage and the classification result as separate predicates and may decline use when the result is `unknown`. That fail-closed use decision does not convert the judgment to `false` and does not change the candidate's world-side features.

When a separate claim-bearing classification assertion is current, it is a C.2.1 episteme. Its exact `EntityOfConcern` is the governed entity about which the classification matters, and its claim content designates the candidate entity or value, local kind, signature edition, context slice, judgment, and relied-on evidence. A value classification may remain inside another claim's content instead of fabricating a value-shaped `EntityOfConcern`. The assertion creates neither candidate nor kind.

A domain that genuinely needs a durable classification-relation occurrence as an object of later relations must supply a separate direct pattern with exact participants, obtaining predicate, occurrence identity, and relation to this judgment. C.3.2 does not mint that occurrence by default.

### C.3.2:7 - Extension as Representation

Materialize `KindExtension(k, slice)` only when a named query, quantification, comparison, review, or publication needs the current true-candidate set.

- Pin the `KindSignature` edition used by the representation even though the compact name shows only `k` and `slice`.
- State the declared candidate domain without inventing `U.EntitySet`.
- Include exactly the candidate values whose pinned judgment is `true`; do not insert `unknown` candidates as false or silently omit their unresolved status when the receiving use needs it.
- Treat braces, rows, indexes, or database results as representations. They do not create a collection holon, an A.14 membership occurrence, a direct classification relation, or the candidate features.
- Use C.29 when the mathematical lens or represented set changes a claim-bearing use. Otherwise the extension may remain a local calculation.

A changed candidate state or later context slice can change `KindExtension(k, slice)` without changing the signature or local kind. A changed extension row cannot repair an inconsistent declaration or subkind link.

### C.3.2:8 - Subkind Monotonicity and Change

For exact reference-scheme edition `RS`, monotonicity is a law over judgments whenever `SubkindOfObtains(k1, k2; RS)` holds. Use an identified `R_sub : U.SubkindOf` occurrence only when a receiving use needs occurrence identity; an assertion that the predicate holds is a separate C.2.1 episteme:

> When both judgments are defined for the same candidate and context slice under the paired signature editions used by the comparison, `J(candidate, k1, edition1, slice) = true` implies `J(candidate, k2, edition2, slice) = true`.

A counterexample diagnoses an inconsistent subkind link, incompatible signature editions, or an undeclared context bridge. Repair that governing defect; do not silently edit the extension table. Cross-context classification goes through C.3.3. When a kind bridge is used, C.3.3 governs its `CL^k` and reliance/assurance consequence; the bridge does not by itself change signature formality, claim scope, or either local classification judgment.

Keep these changes distinct:

| Change | Direct consequence | What does not follow automatically |
| --- | --- | --- |
| typed use crosses from one bounded context to another | assess the exact source and target local kinds through C.3.3 and evaluate under the target `KindSignature` edition | kind continuity or an adequate bridge merely because schemes or slices match |
| criterion, evaluation domain, signature `EntityOfConcern`, or effective reference scheme changes within one bounded context | another `KindSignature` episteme edition | a new local kind; C.3.1 decides continuity |
| candidate state changes | reevaluate that candidate in the relevant slice | a new signature or kind |
| context slice changes | another judgment input and potentially another extension | scope on the kind |
| formality or evidence changes | declaration rigor or assertion support changes | a different judgment truth in an otherwise fixed and already settled world |
| publication form changes | another form or carrier for the same episteme may exist | another signature, kind, or classification |

### C.3.2:9 - Required Worked Cases

#### C.3.2:9.1 - Physical pump

Within bounded context `Plant-7`, `CoolingPumpKind` is the local kind identified by Plant-7's declared cooling-function distinction. Signature edition `CPS-2` names effective scheme `PS-7`, declares pump candidates, and states a criterion in terms of directly governed flow, heat-transfer, and operating-state features for plant slice `S-14`.

Pump #14 is independently identified as the physical candidate. A calibrated measurement-result episteme supports the assertion that its flow and temperature-difference features meet the criterion; the measurement result is not Pump #14 and does not constitute its cooling performance. With those feature facts settled, `J(Pump #14, CoolingPumpKind, CPS-2, S-14) = true`. An extension used by a maintenance query may represent Pump #14, but the query row does not create its classification.

#### C.3.2:9.2 - Episteme and publication form

The exact maintenance-instruction episteme `MI-22` is evaluated against local kind `DiagnosticInstructionKind` using its claim-bearing content and governed subject. For one bounded maintenance-reading use, the selected page arrangement and notation `MI-22-PDF-Layout` is the publication form that expresses the chosen `MI-22` edition, while exact digital file `MI-22-PDF-File-7` is the `U.PresentationCarrier` that bears that form. Separately, selected arrangement and notation `MI-22-HTML-Layout` is another publication form that expresses the same chosen edition for that bounded use, while exact digital file `MI-22-HTML-File-8` is the `U.PresentationCarrier` that bears the HTML form. This case asserts no C.29 representation because it selects no elements with an explicit correspondence to independently recovered objects and changes no admitted modeling or reasoning operation.

Changing the arrangement, notation, presentation carrier, or file encoding does not by itself change candidate episteme `MI-22`, satisfy the `DiagnosticInstructionKind` criterion, create another kind, or rewrite the classification judgment. If the claim-bearing content, exact signature edition, context slice, and governed candidate facts remain unchanged, the same judgment remains current.

#### C.3.2:9.3 - Non-entity temperature value

The value `87 °C`, interpreted under a declared measurement scale, unit, reference scheme, and time, is evaluated against local kind `HighTemperatureValueKind` whose criterion is a declared interval. The candidate remains that governed non-entity value; no value-shaped entity is fabricated. The classification may stay inside the measurement or diagnostic claim content. The unit and interval must be pinned before a `true` or `false` result is possible.

#### C.3.2:9.4 - Schema label

A database row carries schema label `Customer`, but the receiving claim asks whether account holder #441 is a contractual customer. The label is a cue or supporting source, not the contractual relation that makes the world-side criterion hold. The practitioner must recover the actual candidate and the direct contractual facts. If the candidate were instead the row itself and the local kind concerned row shapes, that different candidate and criterion would have to be stated explicitly.

#### C.3.2:9.5 - Unavailable measurement

At later slice `S-15`, the cooling-pump signature still requires a governed flow measurement, but the measurement dependency is unavailable. The current evaluation returns `unknown`. A safety guard declines reliance on Pump #14 as a cooling pump for that use. The guard does not return `false`, prove that the pump lacks cooling performance, or remove it from a historical extension for `S-14`.

### C.3.2:10 - Additional Transfer Cases

| Case | Repaired use |
| --- | --- |
| Vehicle and PassengerCar | Keep explicit VIN, axle, brake, standard-version, and time conditions in signature editions; test subkind monotonicity over candidate judgments. A registry query result is an extension representation, not `U.EntitySet`. |
| AuthenticatedRequest | Name `AuthStandard v2.3` and key-validity time as dependencies. If the standard is unavailable, the judgment is `unknown` and the receiving guard fails closed without treating the request as known unauthenticated. |
| AdultPatient | Pin jurisdictional threshold, measurement time, and candidate identity. Missing date-of-birth support yields `unknown`; it does not turn the person into a non-adult or make an EHR row the candidate. |

### C.3.2:11 - Work Boundary

Classification does not weaken the work ontology:

- `U.Work` is the admitted U-kind;
- `W : U.Work` is one independently grounded, world-side, dated 4D work occurrence under the direct work pattern;
- a plan, expected-work item, log, card, database row, field bundle, assertion, or description about W is a separate episteme;
- performer assignment, enacted method, temporal extent, containing system, affected referent, material binding, resource use, transformation, production, result, delivery, and acceptance remain separately governed.

A local kind may classify an already identified W. A formal kind symbol, work label, plan, or record never occupies W's individual position, and record existence does not make planned work actual.

### C.3.2:12 - Authoring Rhythm

1. Start with one readable classification sentence and its practical use.
2. Recover the exact candidate and direct features before discussing evidence.
3. Reuse an existing signature edition when it truly governs the criterion, scheme, dependencies, and evaluation domain.
4. Author a new signature edition only when repeated use needs the changed declaration.
5. Return `true`, `false`, or `unknown` without folding in the guard decision.
6. Create an extension representation only for a named set-consuming use.
7. If a separate assertion is required, give the C.2.1 episteme its exact EntityOfConcern, content, scope, evidence use, and edition.

### C.3.2:13 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-C32-1` | Local kind, `KindSignature` episteme, exact four-input judgment, and optional extension representation are separately recoverable. |
| `CC-C32-2` | The signature's exact EntityOfConcern is the local kind, and its content names candidate domain, criterion, slice conditions, reference scheme, assumptions, dependencies, formality, and any current extent rule. |
| `CC-C32-3` | Formality characterizes the declaration episteme only. |
| `CC-C32-4` | Direct governed candidate features make the criterion hold or fail; evidence supports an assertion and does not create membership. |
| `CC-C32-5` | Missing evidence, unavailable dependency, or out-of-domain input yields `unknown`, distinct from known `false`. |
| `CC-C32-6` | No A.14 `MemberOf`, `U.EntitySet`, collection holon, or direct classification occurrence is inferred from the judgment or extension. |
| `CC-C32-7` | Any separate classification assertion is a C.2.1 episteme and creates neither candidate nor kind; a value classification need not fabricate a value-shaped EntityOfConcern. |
| `CC-C32-8` | Subkind monotonicity is tested over defined judgments for the same candidate and slice; counterexamples repair links, editions, or bridges rather than extension rows. |
| `CC-C32-9` | Bounded-context crossing, signature-edition change within one context, C.3.1 kind continuity, candidate-state change, slice change, and extension change remain distinct. |
| `CC-C32-10` | The kind carries no scope; the context slice is an evaluation input, and declaration/assertion scopes stay on their own epistemes. |
| `CC-C32-11` | The five required cases and the `U.Work`/W/episteme distinction all close under the same four-object architecture. |
| `CC-C32-12` | Ordinary use stays readable, and reusable declarations or extensions have named receiving uses. |

### C.3.2:14 - Common Anti-Patterns and Remedies

| Anti-pattern | Remedy |
| --- | --- |
| Treating a kind and its `KindSignature` as one object | Identify the local kind and the declaration episteme separately. |
| Using a measurement, observation, schema label, or source row as membership | Recover the direct candidate features; use the item only as governed support. |
| Returning `false` for missing or unusable information | Return `unknown`; let the receiving guard decide whether to decline use. |
| Reusing A.14 `MemberOf` or minting a direct relation by notation | Keep the C.3.2 result as a classification judgment unless a domain-specific direct pattern is justified. |
| Restoring `U.EntitySet` or treating braces as ontology | Describe the candidate domain and extension as a representation; use C.29 when claim-bearing. |
| Attaching scope or formality to the kind | Keep scope and formality on the declaration or assertion episteme that owns them. |
| Editing an extension to hide a subkind counterexample | Repair the link, incompatible editions, or missing bridge. |
| Classifying a record as actual Work | Recover an independently grounded `W : U.Work`; keep its record as a separate episteme. |

### C.3.2:15 - Consequences

**Benefits.** Classification becomes inspectable without ontology growth, evidence-created truth, or two-valued coercion. Repeated criteria can be reused, and set-consuming uses can receive a bounded representation.

**Costs.** Reliance-bearing uses must pin a signature edition and context slice and preserve `unknown` through the receiving decision.

**Risks avoided.** Kind/declaration collapse, record ontology, implicit time, false-for-unknown, mathematical-set overread, silent subkind repair, and kind/individual substitution are blocked.

### C.3.2:16 - Rationale

The kind, the declaration used to evaluate it, one candidate judgment, and a set representation change for different reasons. Treating them as one object makes evidence, time, scope, and notation rewrite ontology. Their separation preserves ordinary reasoning while supporting exact review when a repeated or safety-relevant use needs it.

### C.3.2:17 - SoTA-Echoing

Model theory and type systems distinguish intensional declarations, satisfaction judgments, and extensions; measurement and evidence disciplines distinguish the subject feature from its observation or support. C.3.2 combines those separations with FPF's episteme identity, context-slice, representation, and direct-object boundaries.

### C.3.2:18 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `C.3`, `C.3.1`, A.6.0 declaration identity, C.2.1 episteme identity, A.2.6 context slices and claim scope, and direct patterns for candidate identity and features.
- **Coordinates with:** `C.3.3` cross-context bridges, `C.3.4` local adaptations, `C.29` mathematical representations, C.2.3 formality, F-G-R evidence and assurance, A.14 collection membership, and `E.24.UK` durable U-kind admission.
- **Does not replace:** the direct subject pattern, evidence-use relation, collection membership, claim-scope governor, guard decision, public-kind admission, or a separately justified durable classification-relation pattern.

### C.3.2:End
