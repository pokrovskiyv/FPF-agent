## C.28 - CausalUse-CAL: Causal-Use Questions, Causality-Ladder Rungs, Identification and Realizability

> **Type:** Calculus (C)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

**Plain-name.** Causal-use calculus.

**Intent.** Govern live causal questions and decision-bearing causal use: improvement, intervention effect, causal fairness, counterfactual comparison, causal policy optimality, realized counterfactual-rung evidence, identified counterfactual estimate, or simulation-only counterfactual output.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** A causal-use question or claim together with the causal-use basis and follow-on records needed to use it admissibly: causality-ladder rung, estimand or contrast, evidence basis, identification status, counterfactual sampling realizability status, supported use, unsupported use, and next move.

**Not a physical ontology.** `C.28` governs how FPF authors, reviewers, and operators use causal models, evidence, and counterfactual reasoning in records, policy claims, fairness claims, method comparisons, and work plans. It does not define physical causality in general and does not replace local domain science.

### C.28:0 - Use This When

Use `C.28` when a claim is being used causally:

- "method A improves result";
- "users who received intervention X had better outcomes";
- "this practice is fair";
- "the agent chose optimally";
- "the model simulates what would have happened";
- "the system can collect counterfactual data";
- "this benchmark shows a causal method is better";
- "this policy should be deployed because it would have changed the outcome".

Use `C.28` especially when the claim must distinguish:

- observed association;
- intervention or action effect;
- counterfactual comparison;
- direct counterfactual-rung data collection;
- identified counterfactual estimate;
- simulation-only counterfactual output;
- causal policy class;
- causal fairness use;
- causality-ladder parity in method comparison.

**Not this pattern when.** If no causal use is claimed, keep the work in the neighboring pattern: `C.16` for measurement, `C.27` for temporal trend or rate-change adequacy, `B.3` for assurance result, `A.10` for evidence graph reference, `G.9` for ordinary parity, `C.11` for local choice, `C.19` for pool policy, `C.24` for call planning, or `C.26` for a surviving quantum-like modeling cue after ordinary causal explanations have been tried.

**Activation boundary.** `C.28` activates at `CausalUseActivation`: causal wording changes what the claim makes admissible for publication, choice, deployment, assurance, audit, benchmark, or support treatment. The trigger is admissible downstream use, not the presence of a causal-looking word. If the wording is only exploratory prose and no causal use governed by `C.28` is made, rewrite to association, trend, measurement, or simulation-only wording and stop.

Exploratory causal-looking prose is not a `CausalUseActivation` by itself. A note may say that a relation is plausible, worth probing, or suggested by traces and still remain in `C.16`, `C.27`, `A.10`, `C.11`, `C.19`, `C.24`, `G.5`, or `G.9` until the text makes a causal use governed by `C.28` admissible. The moment the text makes publication, choice, deployment, assurance, audit, benchmark, or support treatment depend on causal support, `C.28` governs the causal-use boundary.

#### C.28:0.1 - What Goes Wrong If Missed

A causal-looking phrase backed only by association, proxy, simulation-only, or rhetorical support gets promoted into a causal use that requires a named `C.28` support basis and verdict.

Correlation becomes intervention effect. Interventional proxy becomes counterfactual fairness. A simulation becomes realized counterfactual-rung evidence. A benchmark compares methods across different causality-ladder rungs and still publishes one scalar superiority claim. An agentic policy is called optimal without saying whether it is a natural behavior policy, an interventional policy, or a counterfactual policy.

The practical error is laundering: the reader sees causal language but cannot recover what rung, estimand, evidence basis, and supported use are actually admissible.

#### C.28:0.2 - What This Buys

`C.28` gives FPF one cheap first stop for causal use.

The first useful result is not a heavy record. It is one small causal-use triage that says whether causal use is present, which causality-ladder rung is being used, what comparator or counterfactual is in play, what causal evidence-use class supports it, and what the next move is.

Durable cards and profiles appear only when the claim needs them. The pattern buys explicit causal discipline without turning every causal word into a paperwork exercise.

#### C.28:0.3 - First-Minute Questions

`C.28` in 60 seconds is the operational entry into `CausalUseTriageRecord`:

1. Detect whether the claim reaches `CausalUseActivation`: it changes what publication, choice, deployment, assurance, audit, benchmark, or support treatment is admissible.
2. Stop with `nextMove.cheapStop` if the claim only reports association, trend, description, measurement, or simulation-only output.
3. If causal use is live, fill `targetCausalityLadderRung`, `comparatorOrCounterfactualRef`, and `causalEvidenceUseClass`.
4. Fill `supportedUse: CausalUseSupportStatement` and `unsupportedUse: CausalUseUnsupportedStatement` as one action pair.
5. Fill `nextMove: CausalUseNextMove`: choose `cheapStop` or escalate only when the claim is decision-bearing, publication-bearing, assurance-bearing, fairness-bearing, benchmark-bearing, or reusable.

#### C.28:0.4 - First Output

The first output is a `CausalUseTriageRecord`:

```text
CausalUseTriageRecord:
  causalUse: yes | no | unclear
  targetCausalityLadderRung?: CausalityLadderRung
  comparatorOrCounterfactualRef?
  causalEvidenceUseClass: CausalEvidenceUseTriageValue
  supportedUse?: CausalUseSupportStatement
  unsupportedUse?: CausalUseUnsupportedStatement
  nextMove: CausalUseNextMove
```

```text
CausalUseNextMove:
  cheapStop:
    stopNoCausalUse |
    publishAssociationOnly |
    rewriteAsTrendOrAssociation |
    keepSimulationOnlyModelUse |
    downgradeCausalWording |
    abstainFromCausalUse |
    rerouteToNeighborPattern
  escalateOnlyIfLoadBearing:
    openLocalCausalUseQuestionCard |
    openDurableCausalUseQuestionCard |
    buildCausalIdentificationProfile |
    buildCounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile |
    planCausalUseEvidenceDesign |
    openCausalFairnessUseAuditCard |
    openCausalMethodRungParityRecord
```

```text
CausalEvidenceUseTriageValue =
  observationalAssociationSupportBasis |
  interventionalActionSupportBasis |
  realizedCounterfactualSampleSupportBasis |
  identifiedCounterfactualEstimateSupportBasis |
  simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis |
  missing
```

`cheapStop` values are terminal or downgrade actions. They close the local causal-use question for now by saying what narrower use remains admissible, which neighboring pattern governs the remaining non-causal question, or that causal use is declined. `escalateOnlyIfLoadBearing` values are record-opening actions. They are admissible only when the supported-use and unsupported-use boundary cannot safely carry the reader's next action by itself.

If this first output cannot be written honestly, the causal-use claim is not ready.

`CausalUseSupportStatement` is one concrete causal-use action the current support makes admissible, such as publish association-only wording, use a bounded interventional estimate for a named decision, deploy only under a named policy constraint, run a fairness audit under a named causal estimand, or compare methods only inside one declared causality-ladder rung. It is not a confidence label, graph name, method name, or generic "evidence exists" phrase.

`CausalUseUnsupportedStatement` is the matching concrete causal-use action the current support does not make admissible, such as intervention-effect wording, realized counterfactual sample wording, causal fairness certification, causal policy optimality, cross-rung benchmark superiority, or release/deployment use. The supported and unsupported statements travel as a pair so the reader can act without inferring the boundary from prose tone.

The triage record may be the final causal-use carrier. Triage lines are enough when they block the overclaim and tell the reader what narrower use remains admissible. Do not open a local card merely because the word "cause", "effect", or "counterfactual" appears.

The triage `causalEvidenceUseClass` field is the first-pass alias for `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis | missing`. If a claim escalates beyond triage, the value must dock to `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis`; `missing` becomes `unsupportedUse`, `CausalUseSupportVerdict = unsupported`, or `abstain`.

### C.28:1 - Problem Frame

FPF already has dedicated neighboring patterns for measurement, evidence, assurance, temporal claims, decisions, exploration, call planning, fairness, method dispatch, parity, and quantum-like modeling. None of those neighbors should become the general authority for causal use.

`C.28` exists because causal use cuts across those neighbors. The same sentence can be:

- a measurement description handled by `C.16`;
- a temporal trend handled by `C.27`;
- an assurance claim handled by `B.3`;
- an evidence graph reference handled by `A.10`;
- a decision record handled by `C.11`;
- a pool-policy record handled by `C.19`;
- a call-planning record handled by `C.24`;
- a fairness audit handled by `D.5`;
- a parity report handled by `G.9`;
- a quantum-like residual handled by `C.26`;
- or a causal-use claim governed here.

The first pattern task is therefore not to classify wording for its own sake. It is to recover the live causal question, the target causality-ladder rung, the support basis currently available, and the cheapest truthful next move. Sometimes that move is to downgrade the claim to association, temporal change, metric-only fairness, or simulation-only use. Sometimes it is to open identification, realizability, evidence-design, fairness, policy-evaluation, or benchmark-parity work. `C.28` exists to keep those moves distinct and to stop teams from acting as if an identification, realizability, or intervention-support basis had already been earned.

### C.28:2 - Problem

Causal language is easy to overclaim because ordinary prose hides the difference between association, action, counterfactual comparison, realized counterfactual sample, identified estimate, and simulation.

Three collapses are especially dangerous:

1. **Rung collapse.** Observational association, interventional action/effect, and counterfactual comparison are treated as one causality-ladder rung.
2. **Support collapse.** Observed data, experimental data, direct counterfactual-rung samples, identified estimates, and simulations are treated as one evidence basis.
3. **Use collapse.** A result that supports one use, such as association reporting, is reused for another use, such as causal fairness, policy optimality, or method superiority.

`C.28` prevents those collapses by making rung, support, and use explicit before claims requiring higher causal support are admitted.

### C.28:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Causal safety vs cognitive affordability | FPF must block causal laundering without forcing every causal word into a full causal dossier. |
| Rung clarity vs ordinary language | Ordinary language says "improves", "causes", "fair", or "would have"; FPF must recover whether that means association, intervention, or counterfactual comparison. |
| Identification vs realizability | A counterfactual estimand may be identifiable from other data but not directly sampleable, or directly sampleable under action constraints but not generally available. |
| Graph/formalism precision vs reader usability | SCM, DAG, ADMG, SWIG, SCM twin network, AMWN, and counterfactual graphical model names matter, but they must not bury the first practical move. |
| Domain plurality vs one FPF pattern | SCM/PCH, potential outcomes, target-trial emulation, causal ML, transportability, causal representation learning, causal RL, and causal fairness must all remain recognizable without making `C.28` a one-school vocabulary. |
| Neighbor fit vs authority creep | Neighbor patterns need causal-use hooks, but they must not redefine causal-use question, rung, estimand, identification, or realizability. |

### C.28:4 - Solution

Use a three-level causal-use escalation:

1. Start with `CausalUseTriageRecord`.
2. Escalate to `LocalCausalUseQuestionCard` or `DurableCausalUseQuestionCard` only when the claimed use needs a reusable causal-use record.
3. Add profiles or specialized records only when the claim triggers that exact need: identification, realizability, evidence design, fairness, policy evaluation, transportability, estimation validity, causal-variable representation, or parity.

The default move is cheap. The heavy move is triggered.

| Record or profile kind | Ordinary size | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CausalUseTriageRecord` | one short record; usually `5-8` lines covering activation, rung, comparator/counterfactual, causal evidence-use class, supported use and unsupported use pair, and next move | any live causal wording or suspected causal laundering |
| `LocalCausalUseQuestionCard` | one small card; usually one causal-use question, one rung, optional comparator/estimand, one support basis, one supported use and unsupported use pair, and one next move | the team needs a reusable local record but not a publication/release/fairness/benchmark/assurance object |
| `DurableCausalUseQuestionCard` | one durable card with causal-use kind, estimand, timing/outcome when needed, assumptions, rival causes, support basis, supported use and unsupported use pair, next move, and reopen/exit condition | the claim is decision-bearing, publication-bearing, fairness-bearing, benchmark-bearing, assurance-bearing, or reusable |
| heavy profile or specialized record | only the fields needed for the named triggered question or work item; absent fields remain absent rather than becoming implied dossier requirements | identification, realizability, target-trial emulation, parameter estimation, transportability, off-policy evaluation, causal representation, evidence design, fairness audit, or causal parity is materially needed |

#### C.28:4.0 - Causal-use governance and consumer carry-through boundary

`C.28` governs causal-use objects and causal-use support roles. Neighbor patterns keep their local authority and consume only the causal-use pieces they need: measurement, evidence path, assurance, fairness, decision, exploration, call-planning, dispatch, parity, and refresh records do not become causal-use governing patterns by carrying `C.28` fields.

| Object or decision | `C.28` governs | Neighbor may carry | Neighbor must not do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Causal-use kind and rung | `CausalUseClaimKind`, `CausalityLadderRung`, causal-use question, comparator/counterfactual, estimand, supported use, unsupported use | `causalUseSpec?`, `causalActionUseSpec?`, method dispatch spec, parity record, fairness audit card | Infer causal-use kind from local vocabulary alone or publish a higher `CausalityLadderRung` without C.28 support |
| Causal evidence support basis | `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis` and its five values | Evidence path refs in `A.10`, evidence-role specializations in `A.2.4`, consumer fields in `B.3`, `C.19`, `D.5`, `G.5`, and `G.9` | Mint another support-basis value set, add assumption-only/no-support values, or let simulation-only output become realized evidence by name |
| Identification and realizability | `CausalIdentificationProfile`, `CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile`, their verdicts, and supported use and unsupported use | Evidence, assurance, decision, exploration, call-planning, fairness, dispatch, and parity refs to those profiles | Treat identification as direct sampling, or treat direct-sampling infeasibility as absence of all possible causal support |
| Graph and calculus naming | `CausalGraphRepresentationKind`, `GraphSeparationCriterionKind`, `CausalInferenceCalculusKind`, `StructuralCausalModel`, `CausalDiagramRef` | Named graph refs and calculus refs when the neighbor records the causal-use support basis and cited formalism | Use generic graph prose where a graph formalism or calculus is load-bearing |
| Assurance consequence | `CausalUseSupportVerdict` as causal-use action grammar | `B.3` degrade/block/abstain consequences for `F-G-R/CL` assurance | Let assurance prose certify causal identification, realizability, or fairness |
| Fairness, policy, and parity specialization | Causal-use question/rung/estimand/support basis/support verdict for fairness, policy, and causal method comparison | `D.5` ethical/fairness audit card, `C.11` choice result, `C.19` pool policy, `C.24` call plan, `G.5` method dispatch spec, `G.9` parity report with local refs to consumed `C.28` support | Collapse metric disparity, policy replay, method dispatch, or benchmark score into a causal-use verdict |

A neighbor may quote the `C.28` values it consumes for by-value readability. Quoting the values does not transfer governing authority. A neighbor pattern governs only its local record and must cite `C.28` when the causal-use question or causal-support basis is live.

Compact crosswalk:

| Field or decision slot | Question answered | Typical values | Do not confuse with |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CausalityLadderRung` | What kind of causal question or use is being claimed? | observational association, interventional action, counterfactual comparison | the evidence source or the method family |
| `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis` | What support basis value is being used for that causal use? | observational association, interventional action, realized counterfactual sample, identified counterfactual estimate, simulation-only output | the rung itself, a raw evidence-role name, or a no-support verdict |
| `supportedUse` / `unsupportedUse` | What may the reader do next, and what must they not do? | `CausalUseSupportStatement`, `CausalUseUnsupportedStatement` | a confidence score, a graph name, a method name, or a neighboring governing pattern |

Rung-support-use examples:

| Rung | Support basis | Supported use | Unsupported use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `observationalAssociationRung` | `observationalAssociationSupportBasis` | association report, descriptive risk comparison, probe selection | intervention-effect claim, causal fairness certification, policy optimality |
| `interventionalActionRung` | `interventionalActionSupportBasis` | declared action-effect use inside assignment, follow-up, and outcome limits | counterfactual sample claim, cross-population policy claim without transportability |
| `counterfactualComparisonRung` | `identifiedCounterfactualEstimateSupportBasis` | identified or bounded counterfactual estimate under assumptions and profile refs | realized sample wording or assumption-free counterfactual certainty |
| `counterfactualComparisonRung` | `simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis` | bounded model-supported simulation use | realized counterfactual sample evidence, intervention-effect evidence |

#### C.28:4.1 - Causality-Ladder Rung

`CausalityLadderRung` is a controlled value set:

```text
CausalityLadderRung =
  observationalAssociationRung |
  interventionalActionRung |
  counterfactualComparisonRung
```

- `observationalAssociationRung` means passive observation, natural behavior, association, or seeing-only case.
- `interventionalActionRung` means `do(x)`, intervention, action setting, experiment, policy change, or action-effect case.
- `counterfactualComparisonRung` means counter-to-fact comparison, unit-history-conditioned comparison, potential-outcome contrast, or counterfactual-imagination case.

A higher causal-use rung is not supported by lower-rung data unless a `CausalIdentificationProfile`, `CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile`, or bounded-use statement says exactly what is supported and what is not.

#### C.28:4.1a - Causal-Use Claim Kind

`CausalUseClaimKind` is the controlled value set for the local causal-use claim being made:

```text
CausalUseClaimKind =
  causalEffectClaim |
  counterfactualComparisonClaim |
  causalFairnessClaim |
  causalPolicyClaim |
  causalBenchmarkParityClaim |
  causalEvidenceSupportClaim |
  causalAssuranceSupportClaim
```

- `causalEffectClaim` means a result is used as an effect, improvement, harm, or intervention/outcome claim.
- `counterfactualComparisonClaim` means a counter-to-fact, potential-outcome, or unit-history-conditioned comparison is being used.
- `causalFairnessClaim` means fairness is claimed through a causal path, intervention, counterfactual, or causal estimand rather than only a metric.
- `causalPolicyClaim` means a policy, action rule, exploration rule, or agentic strategy is claimed as causally preferable.
- `causalBenchmarkParityClaim` means causal methods are compared for parity, superiority, or benchmark consumption.
- `causalEvidenceSupportClaim` means an evidence path is being used as causal-use support.
- `causalAssuranceSupportClaim` means an assurance tuple or support verdict is being used for a causal-use claim.

Simulation-only causal use stays inside the existing claim-kind set. `simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis` is a support/use value, not a new `CausalUseClaimKind`. Use the relevant claim kind, usually `counterfactualComparisonClaim`, `causalPolicyClaim`, `causalBenchmarkParityClaim`, or `causalEvidenceSupportClaim`, and set `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis = simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis` with bounded model-supported use and unsupported use. Bounded model-supported simulation use does not become realized counterfactual sample evidence or intervention-effect evidence. Do not mint a separate simulation-only claim kind merely to avoid naming the support basis value.

Encoding rule: choose the causal-use claim kind by the question being answered, then choose `simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis` as the support basis and write `CausalUseSupportStatement` / `CausalUseUnsupportedStatement` for the bounded simulation use.

#### C.28:4.2 - Causal-Use Cards

Use a local card when the claim needs a small working record:

```text
LocalCausalUseQuestionCard:
  causalUseQuestionRef: U.CausalUseQuestion
  targetCausalityLadderRung: CausalityLadderRung
  causalUseClaimKind?: CausalUseClaimKind
  comparatorOrCounterfactualRef?
  estimandRef?
  causalEvidenceSupportBasis: CausalEvidenceSupportBasis
  supportedUse: CausalUseSupportStatement
  unsupportedUse: CausalUseUnsupportedStatement
  nextMove: CausalUseNextMove
```

Use a durable card when the claim is decision-bearing, publication-bearing, fairness-bearing, benchmark-bearing, assurance-bearing, or reusable:

```text
DurableCausalUseQuestionCard:
  causalUseQuestionRef: U.CausalUseQuestion
  targetCausalityLadderRung: CausalityLadderRung
  causalUseClaimKind: CausalUseClaimKind
  causalInterventionSpecRef?
  comparatorOrCounterfactualRef?
  estimandRef: U.CausalEstimand
  potentialOutcomeContrastRef?
  targetTrialProtocolRef?
  assignmentOrInterventionWindowRef?
  causalFollowUpWindowRef?
  outcomeMeasureRef?
  causalAssumptionSetRef
  rivalCauseSetRef?
  causalEvidenceSupportBasis: CausalEvidenceSupportBasis
  causalIdentificationProfileRef?
  counterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfileRef?
  causalParameterEstimationProfileRef?
  causalTransportabilityProfileRef?
  causalVariableRepresentationRef?
  falsificationOrNegativeControlRef?
  sensitivityAnalysisRef?
  rivalCauseStressTestRef?
  supportedUse: CausalUseSupportStatement
  unsupportedUse: CausalUseUnsupportedStatement
  nextMove: CausalUseNextMove
  reopenOrExitCondition
```

The durable card is not the default. It is the record used when a causal note without the required `C.28` support basis would be unsafe.

#### C.28:4.3 - Causal Evidence Support Basis

`CausalEvidenceSupportBasis` is a controlled value set:

```text
CausalEvidenceSupportBasis =
  observationalAssociationSupportBasis |
  interventionalActionSupportBasis |
  realizedCounterfactualSampleSupportBasis |
  identifiedCounterfactualEstimateSupportBasis |
  simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis
```

This is the `C.28`-governed value set for causal evidence support basis. `causalAssumptionOnlySupport` and `noCausalEvidenceSupport` are not values of `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis`: assumption-only support condition belongs in `causalAssumptionSetRef` plus supported use and unsupported use; no-support basis value belongs in `CausalUseSupportVerdict`, `unsupportedUse`, or `abstain`.

Simulation-only output never becomes realized counterfactual-rung evidence by name alone. It may support model-based use only when assumptions, validation, and supported use and unsupported use are declared.

`realizedCounterfactualSampleSupportBasis` does not mean observing two incompatible outcomes for the same unit in one realized world. It means physically obtaining samples from the declared target counterfactual distribution under the profile's constraints.

`CausalEvidenceSupportBasis` names a support basis value. It is distinct from an evidence source, an `A.2.4` evidence role, and an `A.10` evidence path. Some support bases are direct empirical support-basis classes, such as observational or interventional support. Other support bases are inferential support-basis classes, such as identified counterfactual estimate support. Do not read this value set as only a raw evidence-source kind.

`realizedCounterfactualSampleSupportBasis` does not mean observing two incompatible outcomes for the same unit in one realized world. It means physically obtaining samples from the declared target counterfactual distribution under the profile's physical, ethical, operational, unit-history, and graph constraints.

#### C.28:4.4 - Identification Profile

`CausalIdentificationProfile` answers whether a causal or counterfactual estimand can be expressed from available data plus assumptions, graph representation, and inferential calculus.

```text
CausalIdentificationProfile:
  causalUseQuestionRef: U.CausalUseQuestion
  estimandRef: U.CausalEstimand
  targetCausalityLadderRung: CausalityLadderRung
  sourceCausalEvidenceSupportBasis?: CausalEvidenceSupportBasis
  structuralCausalModelRef?: StructuralCausalModelRef
  causalDiagramRef?: CausalDiagramRef
  causalGraphRepresentationKind?: CausalGraphRepresentationKind
  graphSeparationCriterionKind?: GraphSeparationCriterionKind
  causalInferenceCalculusKind?: CausalInferenceCalculusKind
  causalAssumptionSetRef
  availableDataRegimeSetRef: AvailableCausalDataRegimeSetRef
  realizedCounterfactualDataRefs?: RealizedCounterfactualDataRefSet
  counterfactualDataIdentificationMethodRef?: CounterfactualDataIdentificationMethodRef
  counterfactualDataBoundRef?: CounterfactualDataBoundRef
  causalBoundOrPartialIdentificationRef?
  falsificationOrNegativeControlRef?
  sensitivityAnalysisRef?
  rivalCauseStressTestRef?
  verdict: identified | nonidentified | bounded | unknown
  supportedUse
  unsupportedUse
```

Identification is inferential support. It is not direct physical sampling.

Realized counterfactual data may change an identification route, tighten a bound, or change which assumptions are still needed. When it does, the profile names the data refs, identification method, and bound ref that changed the result. It does not erase the distinction between identification and direct sampling; the profile must still state what is identified, bounded, unknown, or not identified.

#### C.28:4.5 - Counterfactual Sampling Realizability Profile

`CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile` answers whether samples from a counterfactual-comparison target distribution can be physically obtained through admissible actions under physical, ethical, operational, unit-history, and graph constraints.

```text
CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile:
  causalUseQuestionRef: U.CausalUseQuestion
  targetCounterfactualDistributionRef
  targetCausalityLadderRung: counterfactualComparisonRung
  structuralCausalModelRef?: StructuralCausalModelRef
  causalDiagramRef?: CausalDiagramRef
  causalGraphRepresentationKind?: CausalGraphRepresentationKind
  graphSeparationCriterionKind?: GraphSeparationCriterionKind
  causalInferenceCalculusKind?: CausalInferenceCalculusKind
  graphChildInterventionConstraintRef?
  sameUnitConflictCheck
  ancestorRegimeConflictCheck
  physicalConstraintSetRef

  operationalConstraintSetRef
  unitHistoryAvailabilityRef?
  counterfactualSamplingActionSetRef
  counterfactualRandomizationCapabilityRef?
  counterfactualSamplingWorkPlanRef?
  verdict: realizable | nonrealizable | bounded | unknown
  supportedUse
  unsupportedUse
```

Realizability is operational. It asks what work can be done, by which system, with which action primitives, under which constraints.

#### C.28:4.6 - Applied Causal-Inference Profiles

Target-trial and potential-outcomes claims use `TargetTrialProtocolRecord` and `U.PotentialOutcomeContrast` when the causal-use claim is an applied intervention-effect claim.

```text
TargetTrialProtocolRecord:
  causalUseQuestionRef: U.CausalUseQuestion
  targetPopulationRef?
  eligibilityCriteriaRef?
  treatmentStrategySetRef
  treatmentAssignmentProcedureRef?
  timeZeroAlignmentRef?
  causalFollowUpWindowRef
  outcomeMeasureRef
  potentialOutcomeContrastRef?
  estimandRef: U.CausalEstimand
  causalAnalysisPlanRef?
```

Target-trial emulation from observational data adds a mapping/reporting record. `TargetTrialEmulationMappingRecord` records the fit between the protocol and the observed data; `TargetTrialProtocolRecord` alone does not state emulation adequacy.

```text
TargetTrialEmulationMappingRecord:
  targetTrialProtocolRef: TargetTrialProtocolRecord
  observationalDataSourceRef: ObservationalDataSourceRef
  eligibilityMappingRef: TargetTrialEligibilityMappingRef
  treatmentStrategyMappingRef: TargetTrialTreatmentStrategyMappingRef
  assignmentOrTimeZeroMappingRef: TargetTrialAssignmentOrTimeZeroMappingRef
  followUpMappingRef: TargetTrialFollowUpMappingRef
  outcomeMappingRef: TargetTrialOutcomeMappingRef
  emulationGapRef?: TargetTrialEmulationGapRef
  residualConfoundingAssessmentRef?: ResidualConfoundingAssessmentRef
  sensitivityOrAdditionalAnalysisRef?: TargetTrialSensitivityOrAdditionalAnalysisRef
  supportedEmulationUse: CausalUseSupportStatement
  unsupportedEmulationUse: CausalUseUnsupportedStatement
```

Numerical causal estimates use `CausalParameterEstimationProfile` when estimation validity is live:

```text
CausalParameterEstimationProfile:
  estimandRef: U.CausalEstimand
  causalIdentificationProfileRef?
  estimatorRef
  nuisanceModelSetRef?
  orthogonalScoreRef?
  crossFittingPlanRef?
  positivityOrOverlapCheckRef?
  sensitivityAnalysisRef?
  uncertaintyIntervalRef?
  supportedEstimateUse
  unsupportedEstimateUse
```

Transported support uses `CausalTransportabilityProfile`:

```text
CausalTransportabilityProfile:
  causalUseQuestionRef: U.CausalUseQuestion
  sourcePopulationRef
  targetPopulationRef
  sourceContextRef?
  targetContextRef?
  selectionDiagramRef?
  domainShiftAssumptionSetRef?
  transportFormulaOrBridgeRef?
  supportedTransportUse
  unsupportedTransportUse
```

Off-policy causal evaluation uses `OffPolicyCausalEvaluationProfile` when a policy is evaluated from data generated by another behavior or logging policy:

```text
OffPolicyCausalEvaluationProfile:
  evaluationPolicyRef
  behaviorPolicyRef
  causalUseQuestionRef: U.CausalUseQuestion
  sequentialHorizonRef?: SequentialPolicyHorizonRef
  adaptivePolicyClassRef?: AdaptivePolicyClassRef
  unitHistoryConditioningRef?: UnitHistoryConditioningRef
  confoundingAssumptionSetRef?
  supportOrOverlapCheckRef?
  policyTransportabilityRef?: CausalPolicyTransportabilityRef
  offPolicyEstimatorRef?
  uncertaintyIntervalRef?
  supportedPolicyUse
  unsupportedPolicyUse
```

Causal representation learning uses `CausalVariableRepresentationRecord` when abstract causal variables are learned, selected, abstracted, or represented from fine-grained observations rather than given by the domain:

```text
CausalVariableRepresentationRecord:
  causalUseQuestionRef?: U.CausalUseQuestion
  structuralCausalModelRef?: StructuralCausalModelRef
  causalVariableSetRef
  representationSourceRef
  abstractionOrSelectionMethodRef?
  interventionValidityRef?: CausalRepresentationInterventionValidityRef
  mechanismInvarianceRef?: CausalRepresentationMechanismInvarianceRef
  abstractionFidelityRef?: CausalRepresentationAbstractionFidelityRef
  counterfactualQueryPreservationRef?: CausalRepresentationCounterfactualQueryPreservationRef
  representationShiftRef?: CausalRepresentationShiftOrOODRef
  validationRef?
  supportedCausalVariableUse
  unsupportedCausalVariableUse
```

#### C.28:4.7 - Causal Graph Representation Names

Use names that causal inference specialists can recognize:

```text
CausalGraphRepresentationKind =
  causalDirectedAcyclicGraphRepresentation |
  acyclicDirectedMixedGraphRepresentation |
  singleWorldInterventionGraphRepresentation |
  structuralCausalModelTwinNetworkRepresentation |
  ancestralMultiWorldNetworkRepresentation |
  counterfactualGraphicalModelRepresentation
```

When graph separation or graphical calculus is part of the causal-use support, use controlled values rather than open prose:

```text
GraphSeparationCriterionKind =
  dSeparationCriterion |
  mSeparationCriterion |

`CausalGraphRepresentationKind`, `GraphSeparationCriterionKind`, and `CausalInferenceCalculusKind` are formal-support classification values, not minted model objects. They classify the formal support form being used for causal support. Concrete `...Ref` fields point to actual models, diagrams, proof objects, assumptions, or epistemes and must be present when that formal support form is load-bearing. For example, `StructuralCausalModelRef` cites a concrete SCM object, while `structuralCausalModelTwinNetworkRepresentation` classifies a representation form.

`StructuralCausalModel` is the causal model kind with endogenous variables, exogenous variables, structural assignments, and intervention semantics. `structuralCausalModelTwinNetworkRepresentation` means the SCM twin-network representation used in counterfactual reasoning with shared exogenous variables. It is not a deep-learning twin network.

Acronyms such as SCM, DAG, ADMG, SWIG, and AMWN may appear as source/plain labels and bridge notes. FPF Tech values expand the source name when expansion reduces alias risk.

#### C.28:4.8 - Causal Use Evidence Design

Use `CausalUseEvidenceDesignRecord` when the causal-use claim needs evidence planning, evidence graph support, experiment or quasi-experiment design, counterfactual randomization, mixed-design accountability, or simulation validation.

This record does not replace `A.10` or `B.3`. It gives them causal-use structure.

Higher-requirement causal evidence is worth planning only when it can change a choice, deployment decision, fairness consequence, assurance consequence, or benchmark conclusion enough to justify its cost, risk, and delay. If additional support would not change the next action, keep the narrower supported use explicit and stop.

#### C.28:4.9 - Verdicts

`CausalUseSupportVerdict` is the action grammar:

- `supported` means proceed only under the named supported use.
- `bounded` means proceed only inside the named limit and record `causalBoundedUseReason`.
- `unsupported` means downgrade the claim or remove causal use.
- `abstain` means no causal-use conclusion and records `causalAbstainReason`.

No verdict is allowed to silently widen the claim beyond its evidence support basis.

#### C.28:4.10 - Causal Action Policy Class

Use `CausalActionPolicyClass` when a decision, exploration policy, call plan, or agentic strategy depends on causal rung:

```text
CausalActionPolicyClass =
  naturalBehaviorPolicy |
  interventionalPolicy |
  counterfactualPolicy
```

- `naturalBehaviorPolicy` follows observed or natural behavior.
- `interventionalPolicy` chooses an action or `do(x)`.
- `counterfactualPolicy` acts conditioned on natural action, unit history, or counterfactual response.

This distinction matters for `C.11`, `C.19`, and `C.24`; it does not make those patterns the authority for causal evidence, identification, or realizability.

`CausalActionPolicyClass` is a classification value for policy-use class: natural behavior, interventional action, counterfactual policy, mixed policy, or unknown policy. It is not the policy object, not `U.Policy`, not `C.19` pool policy, and not the executable policy used by an agent.

#### C.28:4.10a - Local `U.*` Docking

`U.CausalUseQuestion` names the question whose answer would make a causal use admissible: association use, intervention-effect use, counterfactual-comparison use, causal fairness use, causal policy use, causal evidence support use, causal assurance use, or causal parity use. It governs the question-to-use relation, not the evidence path, estimator, policy object, graph object, or local neighbor pattern.

`U.CausalEstimand` names the target quantity, contrast, distribution, or functional answer shape for a `U.CausalUseQuestion`. It binds the question to what would have to be estimated, identified, sampled, bounded, or emulated. It is not the estimator, not the observed metric, not the graph, not the policy object, and not the support verdict.

The card/profile family docks to those heads this way: triage decides whether a `U.CausalUseQuestion` is live; local and durable cards stabilize the question, `U.CausalEstimand`, and supported use and unsupported use boundary; profiles and specialized records state what support basis, formal support form, operational work, assumptions, and admissible use the question-estimand pair can carry.

Local name cards:

| Name | Kind | Plain sense | Must not mean |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `U.CausalUseQuestion` | question object for causal-use admissibility | the question-to-use object stabilized by triage/local/durable cards before a claim is used causally | a whole research project, evidence path, graph, estimator, policy object, or neighboring-pattern application |
| `U.CausalEstimand` | target causal quantity, contrast, distribution, or functional | the answer-shape object linked to a `U.CausalUseQuestion` before estimation, identification, sampling, bounding, or emulation is judged | estimator, metric reading, support verdict, policy object, or causal graph |

Lexical tripwires:

| Phrase | Use instead when load-bearing |
| --- | --- |
| "causal evidence" | name `CausalEvidenceSupportBasis`, `A.10` evidence path refs, `CausalUseSupportRecordRef`, and `CausalUseSupportStatement` / `CausalUseUnsupportedStatement` |
| "counterfactual data" | distinguish realized counterfactual data refs, `realizedCounterfactualSampleSupportBasis`, `identifiedCounterfactualEstimateSupportBasis`, and `simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis` |
| "policy optimality" | name `causalPolicyClaim`, `CausalActionPolicyClass`, `OffPolicyCausalEvaluationProfile`, `CausalUseSupportStatement`, and unsupported unqualified optimality |
| "fairness evidence" | distinguish metric/evaluation fairness from `causalFairnessClaim` with rung, estimand, support basis, support record and verdict, and supported fairness use and unsupported fairness use |
| "method improves" | name whether the claim is association, intervention effect, counterfactual comparison, or parity result, then name rung, support basis, and supported use and unsupported use |
| "what would have happened" | name counterfactual comparison support, realized counterfactual sample support, identified estimate support, or simulation-only bounded model use |

#### C.28:4.11 - Neighbor Routing Table

| If the issue under repair is... | Use... | `C.28` role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| measured value, score, scale, indicator, or metric definition | `C.16` | Only active when the measure is used causally. |
| temporal trend, rate, acceleration, inertia, or rhythm wording | `C.27` | Active when temporal wording is used as causal effect or intervention evidence. |
| evidence graph reference or provenance | `A.10` | Carries evidence/provenance path and C.28 support-basis refs, not causal-use support authority. |
| assurance level, degrade, abstain, or trust or assurance result | `B.3` | Consumes C.28 support verdicts and applies assurance consequences. |
| local decision among options | `C.11` | Provides causal action-policy hooks when value/regret/optimality depends on causal rung. |
| exploration/exploitation over live pools | `C.19` | Provides causal data-collection or causal policy-learning hooks when live. |
| tool/call/enactment plan | `C.24` | Provides optional causal action use spec when the call selects observation, intervention, counterfactual-rung evidence collection, or counterfactual policy conditioning. |
| bias and fairness audit | `D.5` | Provides causal fairness rung and supported fairness use. |
| method dispatch or selector-facing registry | `G.5` | Provides causal method/policy class declarations when causal methods are compared. |
| benchmark or method parity | `G.9` | Provides causal method rung parity. |
| quantum-like modeling cue | `C.26` | Receives only the residual QL cue after causal-use explanation has been tried. |

#### C.28:4.12 - Non-Goals

`C.28` does not:

- define physical causation or decide what causation is in the modeled world;
- choose one causal school, such as SCM/PCH, potential outcomes, target-trial emulation, transportability, causal ML, causal RL, or causal fairness, for all FPF use;
- certify a DAG, SCM, SWIG, AMWN, or other graph as true or sufficient causal support by naming it;
- replace local domain science, domain intervention definitions, outcome definitions, or substantive rival-cause knowledge;
- replace `C.16` measurement and metrics characterization, including metric construction, calibration, and non-causal score interpretation;
- replace `A.10` evidence graph referring, provenance paths, evidence-role carriers, or evidence graph path discipline;
- replace `B.3` trust and assurance calculus, assurance tuples, `F-G-R/CL` consequences, or assurance publication use;
- replace `D.5` bias audit and ethical assurance, causal-fairness audit responsibility, or human/group-impact review;
- replace `G.9` parity benchmark harness, causal-rung parity screen, or benchmark report structure;
- replace `C.11` choice, `C.19` exploration/exploitation policy, or `C.24` call-planning patterns; it only supplies causal-use support boundaries consumed by those patterns.

#### C.28:4.13 - Cheap Downgrade Library

Use a downgrade sentence when a narrower admissible use is enough:

Each sentence below is an admissible `cheapStop` wording. It closes the causal-use question for the named insufficient-support case unless the author keeps a publish, choose, deploy, assure, audit, benchmark, or support-treatment use that commits the text beyond the `cheapStop` boundary alive.

| Case | Admissible downgrade wording |
| --- | --- |
| association-only case | "Observed association only; supported use = association report; unsupported use = intervention-effect claim." |
| temporal-change-only case | "Temporal change or trend is recorded; supported use = temporal/rate description; unsupported use = causal-effect claim until a causal-use support basis is named." |
| simulation-only case | "Simulation-only counterfactual output; supported use = bounded model-supported exploration or explanation; unsupported use = realized counterfactual sample evidence or intervention-effect claim." |
| metric-only fairness case | "Metric disparity or metric improvement is recorded; supported use = metric-level fairness or disparity report; unsupported use = causal fairness claim without a causal rung, estimand, support basis, and supported fairness use." |
| logged-policy bounded case | "Logged-policy evidence supports only the declared behavior-policy and evaluation-policy regime; supported use = bounded off-policy evaluation under named overlap/transportability limits; unsupported use = unqualified optimal-policy claim." |
| cross-rung benchmark case | "Methods answer different causal rungs or support bases; supported use = publish bridge and loss, degraded parity, or abstain; unsupported use = one scalar causal winner." |

#### C.28:4.14 - CausalUseBureaucracySniffTest

`CausalUseBureaucracySniffTest` keeps a causal-use carrier only when it changes the admissible next action or blocks a concrete overclaim. Keep the causal-use record only when at least one answer is "yes":

| Question | If no |
| --- | --- |
| Did the record change the next action? | Remove fields until only the action-changing line remains. |
| Did it block a concrete causal overclaim by naming the causal use governed by `C.28` as unsupported? | Use association, trend, simulation-only, or metric-only wording and stop. |
| Did it support one concrete decision, evidence-work, fairness, assurance, benchmark-parity, or deployment move by changing `supportedUse` or `unsupportedUse`? | Keep the neighboring pattern and do not open a durable causal-use object. |
| Was there a cheaper `nextMove.cheapStop` that preserved the same admissible use boundary? | Use the cheaper stop. |
| Is the problem only the word "causal" or "counterfactual", rather than an admissible causal use? | Repair wording locally or apply the neighboring language or authoring pattern. |

#### C.28:4.15 - PublicationUnit Stability Relation

When the live problem is only local wording pressure inside one `PublicationUnit`, local lexical-head repair under `E.17.AUD.LHR`, whole-unit primary entity-of-concern stabilization under `E.17.AUD.OOTD`, relational precision restoration, explanation faithfulness, or conservative retextualization, apply the governing publication-side FPF pattern rather than `C.28`. `C.28` opens at `CausalUseActivation`, when the wording makes publication, choice, deployment, assurance, audit, fairness, policy, or benchmark use depend on causal support.

#### C.28:4.16 - Causal-Laundering Golden Cases

| Case | Expected `C.28` output |
| --- | --- |
| Association laundering: "users who received X improved, so X works." | rung = `observationalAssociationRung`; support basis = `observationalAssociationSupportBasis`; supported use = association report; unsupported use = intervention-effect claim. |
| Intervention overclaim: "we changed X once, so the policy will work everywhere." | rung = `interventionalActionRung`; support basis = `interventionalActionSupportBasis` inside assignment, context, follow-up, and transportability limits; unsupported use = cross-population or unbounded policy claim. |
| Simulation laundering: "the simulator shows what would have happened." | claim kind = relevant existing `CausalUseClaimKind`; support basis = `simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis`; supported use = bounded model-supported use; unsupported use = realized counterfactual sample or intervention-effect evidence. |
| Metric-only fairness laundering: "fairness improved because the metric improved." | supported use = metric-level fairness/disparity report; unsupported use = causal fairness claim unless `causalFairnessClaim`, rung, estimand, support basis, and supported fairness use are declared. |
| Policy replay overclaim: "logged replay says this policy is optimal." | claim kind = `causalPolicyClaim`; support basis = off-policy causal evaluation with behavior-policy refs and evaluation-policy refs and overlap checks and support checks; supported use = bounded policy evaluation; unsupported use = unqualified optimality. |
| Cross-rung benchmark: "method A beats method B as a causal method." | claim kind = `causalBenchmarkParityClaim`; use `G.9` `CausalRungParityScreen`; supported use = within-rung parity or declared bridge and loss; unsupported use = one scalar causal winner when rungs/support bases differ. |
| Temporal-cause wording: "after launch, recovery got faster, so launch caused resilience." | supported use = `C.27` temporal/rate adequacy; unsupported use = causal-effect claim until `C.28` names intervention timing, outcome window, assumptions, rival causes, and support basis. |
| QL escape: "ordinary probability is hard here, so the effect is quantum-like." | supported use = causal-use triage and ordinary-neighbor explanation first; unsupported use = bypassing `C.28` with quantum-like vocabulary; `C.26` is retained only for residual quantum-like probe, frame, order, export, or coarsening issue. |
| Target-trial name-drop: "we emulate a trial, so the effect is identified." | supported use = target-trial claim only with protocol plus emulation mapping, data source, assignment and time-zero, follow-up and outcome mapping, residual confounding, and sensitivity analysis and additional analysis; unsupported use = identification claim by target-trial label alone. |
| Realized-counterfactual-data claim: "we observed both outcomes for the same unit." | supported use = samples from the declared target counterfactual distribution under the realizability profile's constraints; unsupported use = same-world incompatible-outcome wording for one unit. |

### C.28:5 - Archetypal Grounding

**Tell.** A causal-use claim is a promise about what a reader may do with a result. The claim is safe only when the rung, contrast, support basis, and allowed use are named.

**Show (System).** A product team observes that users who received an intervention had better outcomes. `C.28` first records an observational association unless the team can name an interventional-action design, target trial protocol, identification profile, or evidence design that supports intervention-effect use. If the team only has observational association, the next move is to publish association or build evidence, not to claim causal improvement.

**Show (Episteme).** A fairness report says one model is fair because a metric improved after a policy change. `C.28` asks whether the fairness claim is associative, interventional, or counterfactual. If it is interventional-action-rung only, it cannot be published as counterfactual fairness without identification or realizability support.

**Show (Policy).** A team wants to deploy a causal policy learned from logged behavior data. `C.28` records `causalPolicyClaim`, `interventionalActionRung` or `counterfactualComparisonRung` as appropriate, `CausalActionPolicyClass`, `OffPolicyCausalEvaluationProfile`, support/overlap checks, uncertainty, supported policy use, and unsupported policy use. If the behavior policy cannot support the target policy, the admissible output is bounded use or abstain rather than "the policy is optimal".

**Show (Causal RL).** An online learner uses behavior-policy logs and counterfactual data-fusion to choose a treatment, ranking, or action policy. `C.28` records the natural behavior policy, evaluation policy, `CausalActionPolicyClass`, target rung, confounding/support assumptions, `OffPolicyCausalEvaluationProfile`, uncertainty, supported policy use, and unsupported policy use. The learner may publish bounded causal policy support only for the declared regime; it must not turn replay reward, exploration success, or counterfactual strategy output into an unqualified optimal-action claim.

**Show (Evidence Work).** A lab can physically run a counterfactual-rung sampling procedure by assigning compatible action regimes to matched units under ethical and operational constraints. `C.28` separates `CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile` from `CausalIdentificationProfile`: the realized sampling work becomes `U.Work` with evidence carriers and guards, while identification remains the inferential route from assumptions, graph, calculus, and available data.

**Show (Simulation-Only).** A simulator produces "what would have happened" traces for a rollout decision. `C.28` can allow useful model-supported use without calling the traces realized counterfactual-rung evidence: the record uses `simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis`, names `counterfactualModelAssumptionSetRef`, `simulationValidationRef`, supported simulation use, and unsupported use. The output may support rehearsal, sensitivity exploration, or model-based explanation inside declared limits; it does not support direct counterfactual sample wording or intervention-effect publication by vocabulary alone.

**Show (Benchmark).** A benchmark compares one observational predictor, one intervention optimizer, and one counterfactual strategy. `C.28` does not ban the comparison, but it requires `CausalMethodRungParityRecord` through `G.9`: if rung, `estimandRef`, interventional-action basis, support basis, consumed `C.28` support record and verdict, transportability, follow-up window, and estimation-validity basis are not comparable, the benchmark publishes bridge and loss relation, degraded use, or abstain instead of one superiority claim.

### C.28:6 - Bias-Annotation

`C.28` is mainly a causal-discipline and anti-overclaim pattern for decision-bearing causal use. One part of that work is catching language laundering, but the larger job is to keep causal reasoning, evidence design, realizability, policy evaluation, fairness use, and benchmark parity from silently borrowing a `C.28` support basis, support verdict, or admissible-use value they do not actually have.

Common biases:

- **Causal prestige bias.** A result sounds more important when phrased causally, so under-supported evidence gets overused.
- **Simulation laundering.** A simulated counterfactual is treated as observed or realized counterfactual-rung evidence.
- **Metric proxy bias.** A fairness or performance proxy is treated as a causal result without rung and estimand.
- **Benchmark scalarization bias.** A method comparison collapses different causal rungs, estimands, or transport assumptions into one score.
- **Graph sufficiency bias.** A named graph is treated as enough without assumptions, data regime, calculus, and admissible use.

The repair is not to ban causal language. The repair is to recover the live causal question, choose the least-committing admissible causal use supported by the available evidence, and then either downgrade, bound, design a causal-evidence plan with the required `C.28` support basis, open identification or realizability work, or abstain.

### C.28:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-C28-0` Triage-only use | For triage-only use, causality-ladder rung is named or causal use is declined, supported use and unsupported use is named, and a causal-use claim beyond triage is not implied. |
| `CC-C28-1` Causality-ladder rung declaration | Every causal-use claim declares its target causality-ladder rung: observational association question, interventional action/effect question, or counterfactual comparison question. |
| `CC-C28-2` Durable causal estimand discipline | Every durable interventional/counterfactual-rung causal-use claim names causal-use question, comparator or counterfactual, estimand, assignment or intervention window, follow-up window, outcome measure, assumptions, rival causes, and supported use and unsupported use. |
| `CC-C28-3` No unsupported causality-ladder climb | A claim at interventional-action or counterfactual-comparison rung is not supported only by lower-rung causality-ladder data unless `CausalIdentificationProfile`, `CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile`, or bounded-use treatment is cited. |
| `CC-C28-4` Realizability is not identification | `CausalIdentificationProfile` and `CounterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfile` remain distinct. One supports inference from other data; the other supports direct sampling through feasible physical actions. |
| `CC-C28-5` Counterfactual data collection is work | Any realized counterfactual-rung-data procedure is represented as `U.Work` enacted by `U.System` under `RoleAssignment`, with `MethodDescription`, `WorkPlan`, evidence carriers, and physical, ethical, and operational guards. |
| `CC-C28-6` Verdicts are action grammar | `supported`, `bounded`, `unsupported`, and `abstain` each change what the reader may do next. |
| `CC-C28-7` No durable-card default | Escalate from triage to local card to durable card and profiles only when the claimed use triggers the durable causal-use object. |
| `CC-C28-8` Heavy causal-use object payoff | Every selected heavy field or check changes a reader action, blocks a specific overclaim, or supports a concrete evidence and assurance/fairness/parity decision. |
| `CC-C28-9` Semantic-authority split | `C.28` governs causal-use value sets, identification profiles and realizability profiles, graph naming and calculus naming, and support verdicts; neighbors may consume or quote them but must not define competing causal-use value sets. |
| `CC-C28-10` Simulation-only bounded use | Simulation-only output may support bounded model-supported use, but it never becomes interventional evidence or realized counterfactual sample evidence by vocabulary, validation, or role relabeling alone. |
| `CC-C28-11` Decision-economics of evidence | A causal-evidence plan for deployment, assurance, audit, benchmark, policy, fairness, or support-treatment use names the decision threshold, evidence value or probe-worthiness, and cost/risk condition when escalation is not already mandatory by safety, release, or assurance constraints. |

### C.28:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fill-all-cards default | Every mention of "cause", "effect", or "counterfactual" triggers a durable dossier. | Start with `CausalUseTriageRecord`; escalate only when the claimed use requires it. |
| Causal certification theater | Every field is filled, but no reader action, evidence design, downgrade, or unsupported use changes. | Remove fields or downgrade their claim-use until each remaining field changes a decision or blocks an overclaim. |
| Association as intervention | "Users who received intervention X did better" is published as effect of X without action/assignment support. | Publish association or build identification/evidence design. |
| Interventional proxy as counterfactual fairness | A policy-change metric is called counterfactual fairness. | Declare interventional-action rung unless counterfactual estimand plus identification or realizability is present. |
| Simulation as realized counterfactual sample | Model output is described as realized counterfactual-rung support without direct sampling or validation. | Use `simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis` and name supported model use and unsupported model use. |
| Graph-only causality | A DAG or SCM diagram is treated as sufficient support. | Add assumptions, data regime, graph representation kind, calculus, and admissible use. |
| Cross-rung benchmark | Methods are compared as peers while one answers association, another intervention, and another counterfactual comparison. | Use `CausalMethodRungParityRecord` and degrade or abstain when parity is absent. |
| QL escape | Causal confusion is rebranded as quantum-like because ordinary probability feels hard. | Use `C.26` only after causal-use explanation and ordinary FPF neighbors have done their work. |

### C.28:9 - Consequences

`C.28` makes causal use slower only when the claim commitment, consequence risk, or evidence demand warrants it. Cheap causal triage remains cheap.

Positive consequences:

- Causal claims become inspectable by rung, support basis, and admissible use.
- Counterfactual sampling realizability becomes operational rather than merely philosophical.
- Identification and realizability no longer collapse.
- Fairness, policy, and benchmark claims stop borrowing causal force beyond what their evidence supports.
- Neighbor patterns receive narrow causal hooks without becoming general causal authorities.

Costs:

- Authors must learn a small causal vocabulary.
- Some attractive claims will be downgraded to association, bounded use, simulation-only, or abstain.
- Higher-rung claims need more evidence, assumptions, or work-plan detail.

The cost is intended. It is cheaper than publishing an unsupported causal use.

### C.28:10 - Rationale

FPF needs this pattern because causal language changes what a reader may do.

Temporal language can say that something changed. Measurement language can say that a score is higher. Assurance language can say that evidence has more or less support. None of those alone says that an action caused a result, that a counterfactual comparison is supported, or that a causal policy should be deployed.

`C.28` therefore uses a semantic-authority split:

- `C.28` governs causal-use question, rung, estimand, identification, realizability, causal evidence support basis, and causal-use verdict.
- Neighbor patterns keep their own authority and cite `C.28` only when causal use is live.
- `C.26` receives a causal exit: intervention, causal effect, causal fairness, causal policy, and counterfactual-rung-data realizability are ordinary causal-use questions before they are quantum-like modeling questions.

The pattern is not Pearl-only. SCM/PCH provides the rung discipline, but potential outcomes, target-trial emulation, causal ML estimation, transportability, causal representation learning, causal RL, and causal fairness all change the fields that FPF must preserve.

| Causal representation support depends on intervention validity, invariance, abstraction fidelity, query preservation, and shift handling. | A learned representation must not silently become a causal variable for every query or domain. | Scholkopf et al.: [Toward Causal Representation Learning](https://is.mpg.de/en/publications/scholkopfetal21). | Adopted as causal representation validation hooks in `CausalVariableRepresentationRecord`. |
| Sequential causal games and causal RL make counterfactuality policy-relevant. | Natural behavior, interventional, and counterfactual policies, sequential horizons, adaptive policies, unit-history conditioning, and transportability must be distinguished. | Maiti and Bareinboim: [Sequential Causal Games](https://causalai.net/r145.pdf); Bareinboim/Forney/Pearl: [Bandits with Unobserved Confounders](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5692-bandits-with-unobserved-confounders-a-causal-approach); Forney/Pearl/Bareinboim: [Counterfactual Data-Fusion for Online Reinforcement Learners](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/forney17a.html). | Adopted as `CausalActionPolicyClass` and `OffPolicyCausalEvaluationProfile` hooks. |
| Causal fairness is not only metric choice. | Fairness claims must declare causal rung, path/estimand where live, and supported fairness use. | Plecko and Bareinboim: [Fairness-Accuracy Trade-Offs: A Causal Perspective](https://causalai.net/r107.pdf). | Adopted through `D.5` relation and `CausalFairnessUseAuditCard`. |

### C.28:12 - Relations

- `C.16` governs measurement and metrics. `C.28` activates only when a measurement is used causally.
- `C.27` governs temporal claim adequacy. `C.28` activates when temporal change is used as causal effect, intervention evidence, or counterfactual comparison.
- `A.10` governs evidence graph referring. `C.28` supplies causal evidence support basis and causal-use support refs for evidence paths.
- `A.2.4` governs evidence roles. `C.28` requires the evidence-role distinctions that keep `simulationOnlyCounterfactualOutputBasis`, `identifiedCounterfactualEstimateSupportBasis`, interventional evidence, and `realizedCounterfactualSampleSupportBasis` from being confused.
- `A.6` / `A.6.B` / `A.6.C` govern boundary, deontic, promise, commitment, utterance, contract-language, and L/A/D/E-classified claim language. `C.28` supplies only causal-use support when mixed boundary sentences claim causal effect or counterfactual support.
- `A.15` governs role, method, plan, and work alignment. `C.28` supplies the causal-use semantics for intervention assignment, target-trial emulation, counterfactual sampling work, and causal evidence collection.
- `B.3` governs trust and assurance. `C.28` supplies the causal-use verdict that `B.3` can degrade, bound, or abstain over.
- `C.11` governs decision theory. `C.28` supplies causal-use question and causal action-policy class when value, utility, regret, or optimality depends on causal rung.
- `C.19` governs explore/exploit pool policy. `C.28` supplies causal rung and policy/regime fields when exploration collects causal data or learns causal policy.
- `C.24` governs agentic tool use and call planning. `C.28` supplies `causalActionUseSpec` when calls select observation, intervention, counterfactual-rung evidence collection, or counterfactual policy conditioning.
- `D.5` governs bias audit and ethical assurance. `C.28` supplies causal fairness rung, estimand, support, and supported fairness use.
- `G.5` governs method dispatch and MethodFamily registry. `C.28` supplies causal method or policy class declarations when method dispatch compares causal methods.
- `G.9` governs parity and benchmarks. `C.28` supplies causal method rung parity.
- `G.11` governs refresh orchestration. `C.28` supplies causal-use support records whose realizability, identification, fairness, representation, off-policy, target-trial, and simulation-validation shifts can trigger refresh.
- `C.26` governs quantum-like modeling. `C.28` is a required causal exit before QL retention when the question under repair is intervention, causal effect, causal fairness, causal policy, counterfactual comparison, or counterfactual-rung-data realizability.

### C.28:12a - C.29 mathematical-lens use relation

> `C.29` may document that a mathematical mapping appears abstraction-like, quotient-like, coarse-graining-like, simulation-like, or macro-model-like. It does not decide causal-use support. When the supported use includes intervention, policy, counterfactual, causal explanation, or causal decision, apply `C.28`; otherwise record `CausalUseDisposition = noCausalUseClaim` or `causalUseBlocked`.
