## C.3.3 - KindBridge & CL^k — Cross‑context Mapping of Kinds

> **One-line summary.** Defines **`KindBridge`** as the direct cross-context relation between one exact source local kind and one exact target local kind under pinned reference-scheme editions and a declared mapping predicate. A separate C.2.1 bridge-assertion episteme states direction, paired `KindSignature` editions, order preservation or collapse, `CL^k`, loss notes, definedness, evidence, and admitted use. Target classification is always a fresh four-input C.3.2 judgment; a source result or bridge assertion never creates target truth. `CL^k` affects only the receiving reliance value R, while F and Claim scope G remain with their own owners.

**Status.** Normative in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3.3**.
**Audience.** Engineering managers, architects, assurance leads, editors.

**Depends on.**

* **C.3.1 — U.Kind & SubkindOf (Core):** kinds are context-local `U.Kind` values; `U.SubkindOf` is an obtaining direct relation under an exact effective reference scheme; kinds carry no Scope.
* **C.3.2 — Kind intent, judgment, and extension:** `KindSignature` is a declaration episteme; `J(candidate, kind, signatureEdition, slice)` returns `true`, `false`, or `unknown`; an optional pinned-edition `KindExtension` is only a representation of true candidates.
* **A.2.6 — USM (Context slices & Scopes):** Claim scope (**G**) and Work scope live on claims/capabilities; scope bridging and **CL** penalties are defined there.
* **C.2.2 — F–G–R:** weakest‑link; penalties land in **R**, not **F/G**.
* **C.2.3 — U.Formality (F):** signature rigor.

**Non‑goals.**
— No repository/notation mandates; conceptual only.
— No Scope mapping here (that’s USM); **KindBridge** maps **kinds**, not scopes.
— No new arithmetic on `CL^k`; it reuses the **ordinal anchor semantics** of CL (Part B) but applies to kinds.

### C.3.3:1 - Purpose & Audience

Cross‑context reuse fails in two **orthogonal** ways:

1. **Applicability** (G): *where* the claim holds (handled by USM Scope Bridge).
2. **entityOfConcern** (Kind): *what* the claim quantifies over (handled by **KindBridge**).

**C.3.3** gives managers an explicit, auditable channel for **(2)**, so a team can say, with evidence: *“`Vehicle` in Lab maps to `TransportUnit` in Plant with `CL^k=2`; the EV subkind collapses; here’s what we lost.”* Guards stay deterministic; assurance math stays clean (penalties in **R** only).

### C.3.3:2 - Context

Contexts use different **classifications**: ontology classes vs shape Standards, regulatory cohorts vs app types, etc. Informal “same‑name” reuse silently mutates entityOfConcern. USM already made scope moves explicit. **KindBridge** does the same for kinds: **declare the mapping**, rate its **congruence**, and capture known **losses**.

### C.3.3:3 - Problem

1. **Semantic drift.** Moving a claim into a target‑context with a different taxonomy changes “what counts” without anyone noticing.
2. **Hidden order breaks.** Subkind relationships invert or vanish; downstream proofs/tests are misapplied.
3. **Entangled channels.** Teams conflate “scope mapping” with “kind mapping,” making it impossible to assign penalties coherently.
4. **Incomputable guards.** “We map it somehow” yields non‑deterministic classification at guard time.

### C.3.3:4 - Forces

| Force                                    | Tension to resolve                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimal disclosure vs precision**      | Bridges must be light to write yet precise enough to avoid semantic drift.                      |
| **Local autonomy vs global reuse**       | Each target‑context keeps its vocabulary; reuse requires explicit, reviewable mappings.                   |
| **Typed safety vs agility**              | We need typed compatibility checks without blocking exploratory reuse.                          |
| **Separate channels vs operator workload** | Two channels (Scope & Kind) must be explicit, but guard writers shouldn’t drown in boilerplate. |

### C.3.3:5 - Solution — Direct relation and bridge assertion

A `KindBridge` occurrence is an obtaining direct relation between one exact source local `U.Kind` and one exact target local `U.Kind`. The kinds remain independently identified in their source and target reference schemes. The bridge does not move, clone, or construct either kind. Its obtaining predicate states the exact mapping direction, source and target scheme editions, definedness, and the direct kind-intent correspondence required for that pair. Preservation, collapse, inversion, or non-preservation of a source `U.SubkindOf` fact is instead a separate assertion over the relevant pair of obtaining KindBridge relations and the exact source and target order facts. The paired `KindSignature` editions are declaration epistemes used to evaluate the correspondence predicate; they are not relation participants or occurrence-identity discriminators.

`KindBridge` is the direct relation kind governed here under the common `U.Relation` occurrence discipline of A.6.REL. This spelling does not by itself admit a durable dependent U-kind named `U.KindBridge`. An F.9 Bridge, Bridge Card, mapping row, or publication can serve as a bridge assertion or representation only when its exact content and EntityOfConcern support that use; its existence does not make a `KindBridge` relation obtain or identify an occurrence by record identity.

Keep the direct relation separate from the C.2.1 bridge-assertion episteme used to communicate or rely on it. That episteme designates the exact bridge occurrence when occurrence identity is needed and carries the mapping rule, order-preservation status, `CL^k`, loss notes, definedness area, evidence, and admitted receiving use. An assertion, bridge card, table row, or mapping expression neither makes the bridge relation obtain nor creates a target `KindSignature`. If a target declaration is needed, author and identify that separate C.3.2 declaration episteme first.

For every classified candidate, the target context performs its own exact judgment:

`J(candidate, targetKind, targetSignatureEdition, TargetSlice) ∈ {true, false, unknown}`

A source-context judgment may support the bridge or reliance assertion but is never reused as target truth. Missing target-side evidence, an unavailable target-declaration dependency, or a candidate outside the target evaluation domain yields `unknown` for the target C.3.2 judgment. An unavailable mapping dependency or a bridge use outside declared definedness instead leaves the required bridge reliance unsettled or inadmissible; a receiving guard declines that cross-context use without rewriting an independently evaluated target judgment.

When a receiving claim relies on an obtaining bridge and the target judgment, the bridge-assertion episteme supplies the assessed `CL^k` and loss basis. Apply the monotone `Ψ(CL^k)` consequence to R only. Do not change declaration formality F or Claim scope G.

### C.3.3:6 - Norms & Invariants (normative)

> The following formalize the **KB‑01…KB‑12** rules announced in C.3.

#### C.3.3:6.1 - Direct relation subject and scope

**KB-01 (Participants and obtaining).** A `KindBridge` relation occurrence has exactly two direct participants: one source local kind and one target local kind. It obtains only under the named source and target reference-scheme editions when the directional correspondence predicate holds for the paired kind interpretations within declared definedness. Order preservation or collapse is not an obtaining condition for one pair relation; it is asserted separately over the relevant KindBridge and `U.SubkindOf` occurrences. The `KindSignature` epistemes used to evaluate the correspondence, their formality values, mapping expression, bridge assertion, evidence, `CL^k`, and loss notes are not relation participants.

**KB-02 (No Scope).** A KindBridge MUST NOT map Claim or Work scope G. Scope translation uses the USM Bridge + CL channel (A.2.6, Part B). `U.ContextSlice` values appear in bridge applicability and target judgments, not as scope stored on either kind.

**No blended score.** Congruence for Scope (CL) and for Kind (`CL^k`) MUST NOT be aggregated into a single interoperability score in guards; each channel is assessed and penalized separately. See Annex C.3.A §5 (E-06).

#### C.3.3:6.2 - Settlement, assertion, and identity

**KB-03 (Direct settlement).** The C.3.3 direct relation settlement SHALL make recoverable:

1. the exact source-kind and target-kind participants, direction, and source/target reference-scheme editions;
2. the directional mapping obtaining predicate and its definedness area, with no implicit `latest`; and
3. the occurrence-identity rule: when explicit identity is needed, source kind, target kind, direction, and both reference-scheme editions distinguish the occurrence.

A separate C.2.1 bridge-assertion episteme SHALL name the paired source and target `KindSignature` editions used to evaluate the predicate and, for the receiving use, state the mapping-rule expression, the status of each selected obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relation as preserved, collapsed, not preserved, or unknown, plus any current `CL^k`, loss notes, evidence, admitted use, and assertion polarity. Another assertion, mapping expression, card, row, signature edition, or publication edition does not create another relation occurrence. A changed assertion, signature, or mapping-rule edition prompts reevaluation of obtaining; it does not reidentify a continuing relation when the participants, direction, and scheme editions remain fixed and the same relation still obtains. A changed participant, direction, or scheme edition is another proposed occurrence and must establish obtaining independently.

**KB-04 (Determinism and local evaluation).** With fixed scheme versions and mapping-rule edition, the asserted bridge use MUST be reproducible. Independently, with fixed candidate, target `KindSignature` edition, TargetSlice, and target-declaration dependencies, evaluate reproducible `J(candidate, targetKind, targetSignatureEdition, TargetSlice)` in the target context. A source judgment or bridge assertion may support reliance but MUST NOT be copied into the target result. Preserve `unknown` only for a target judgment whose own declared evaluation cannot settle; an unsettled or inadmissible bridge use and the guard's refusal remain separate receiving predicates.

#### C.3.3:6.3 - Order & Monotonicity

**KB-05 (Monotone order).** If a bridge assertion states that source order fact `SubkindOfObtains(k1, k2; sourceRS)` is preserved, it SHALL designate exact target kinds `k1'` and `k2'`, the respective obtaining `KindBridge` relations from `k1` to `k1'` and from `k2` to `k2'`, and the basis on which `SubkindOfObtains(k1', k2'; targetRS)` holds. Identify a target `R_sub : U.SubkindOf` occurrence only when a receiving use needs occurrence identity.
**KB-06 (No inversions).** A bridge assertion MUST NOT state preservation when the mapped target order is inverted. If `SubkindOfObtains(k2', k1'; targetRS)` holds for distinct mapped kinds, state non-preservation and the exact loss. If the required target order cannot be settled, state `unknown`; do not turn non-settlement into either preservation or inversion.
**KB-07 (Collapse semantics).** A bridge assertion may classify selected source subkind distinctions as collapsed when several source kinds correspond to one target kind. The assertion SHALL designate the affected obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relations and state the lost properties; the direct bridge relation does not alter either local order.

#### C.3.3:6.4 - Congruence & Assurance

**KB-08 (Anchor reuse and AT neutrality).** `CL^k` reuses the ordinal anchor semantics of CL but assesses the declared bridge use over kind intent and order. The bridge-assertion episteme labels it kind-congruence. Neither the obtaining KindBridge relation nor its assertion computes or alters KindAT; AT is editorial and independent of `CL^k`.
**KB-09 (Effect on R only).** When a receiving claim relies on an obtaining KindBridge relation and on `J(candidate, targetKind, targetSignatureEdition, TargetSlice)`, apply the bridge-assertion episteme's monotone `Ψ(CL^k)` consequence to R alongside any independent scope-bridge penalty. Do not alter F or G. An `unknown` target judgment remains `unknown` even when the guard declines use.
**KB‑10 (Chaining).** For a chain of bridges, **effective `CL^k` = min** of the links (weakest‑link).

#### C.3.3:6.5 - Loss Notes & Definedness

**KB-11 (Loss notes).** The bridge-assertion episteme SHALL state which `KindSignature` invariants are not preserved, which obtaining source `U.SubkindOf` relations are collapsed or not preserved, and any higher-equality caveats. These claims do not rewrite the source or target kinds.
**KB-12 (Definedness and guard use).** The bridge obtaining predicate and assertion SHALL state the definedness area. Outside it, a receiving guard declines that cross-context bridge use. The independently evaluated target classification retains its own `true`, `false`, or `unknown` value; bridge inapplicability neither rewrites it nor denies that another bridge could obtain.

### C.3.3:7 - Interactions (informative)

#### C.3.3:7.1 - With USM Scope bridges (two channels)

When using a claim across Contexts, expect **two concurrent bridges**:

* **Scope Bridge (USM):** the exact scope-bridge occurrence supports translation of G; its separate assessment supplies CL and the `Φ(CL)` consequence to R.
* **KindBridge (this pattern):** the obtaining direct relation connects exact source and target kinds; its separate bridge assertion supplies `CL^k`, loss, and the `Ψ(CL^k)` consequence to R.

**Discipline:** compute both; **do not** collapse them into one “interoperability score.”

 See **Annex C.3.A §5 (E‑01)** for the normative evaluation order in guards.

#### C.3.3:7.2 - With target classification (C.3.2)

After an obtaining KindBridge relates source kind `k` to independently identified target kind `k'`, evaluate the exact target judgment `J(candidate, k', targetSignatureEdition, TargetSlice)`. If a mapping rule motivates another target `KindSignature`, a system authors and identifies that declaration episteme separately; the bridge relation and its assertion do not construct it. A source judgment may be evidence for the receiving reliance claim but never substitutes for the target judgment.

#### C.3.3:7.3 - With Role masks (C.3.4)

A cross-context masked use requires an obtaining KindBridge relation between exact source and target kinds, the separate bridge assertion, a target RoleMask declaration episteme, and a `MaskAdapter` declaration episteme when constraints or bindings differ. The target context evaluates its exact `J_mask`; source masked results are not target truth. Any justified bridge penalties affect R only, and a stable target refinement requires an independently identified local kind and obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relation.

#### C.3.3:7.4 - With guards (Annex C.3.A)

Use the **`Guard_XContext_Typed`** macro (Annex C.3.A), which requires **both bridges** and applies **both penalties** to **R**:

* find Scope bridge (CL≥threshold), translate **G**, check coverage;
* establish the exact KindBridge relation and its bridge assertion, recover the independently identified target kind and signature edition, and evaluate the exact target judgment;
* apply **Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**; keep **F/G** untouched.

### C.3.3:8 - Authoring, Review & Rating Guidance (informative)

#### C.3.3:8.1 - Authoring a KindBridge assertion

* **Start narrow & honest.** Declare only the kinds and `⊑` links you **actually preserve**; mark the rest **unknown**.
* **Prefer independently identified target kinds.** If the target already has a suitable kind and declaration edition, relate that kind directly. If a new target declaration is required, author it separately before asserting bridge obtaining; list what the mapping predicate preserves, relaxes, or drops.
* **Write loss notes in plain language.** Example: “EV vs ICE subkinds collapsed; battery‑health invariants dropped.”
* **Fix the definedness area.** Bind to target Standards/versions and any environment selectors essential to classification.
* **Assign `CL^k` from exemplars.** Calibrate on concrete counter‑examples and preserved properties; resist optimistic ratings.

#### C.3.3:8.2 - Review playbook (10 minutes)

1. **Two bridges present?** Scope Bridge **and** KindBridge?
2. **Order claims honest?** Any `⊑` inversions? Collapses disclosed?
3. **`CL^k` plausible?** Based on preserved properties, not name similarity?
4. **Loss notes present?** Will they force narrowing of Scope or extra tests?
5. **Definedness area clear?** Guard will **fail closed** outside it?
6. **Penalties wired to R?** No hidden tweaks to **F/G**?

#### C.3.3:8.3 - Rating `CL^k` (rules of thumb)

* **High `CL^k`**: signature equivalence or **up‑to‑iso**; `⊑` fragment preserved; only cosmetic losses.
* **Medium `CL^k`**: some invariants relaxed or lost; selected subkinds collapsed; order preserved on critical path.
* **Low `CL^k`**: name‑only correspondences; properties diverge; order not preserved. Expect significant **R** penalty and/or adapters.

### C.3.3:9 - Worked Examples (informative)

#### C.3.3:9.1 - Vehicle → TransportUnit (manufacturing)

Source kinds `Vehicle` and `PassengerCar`, target kinds `TransportUnit` and `PassengerTransportUnit`, and their exact declaration editions are independently identified. One KindBridge relation obtains from `Vehicle` to `TransportUnit` and another from `PassengerCar` to `PassengerTransportUnit` under the pinned scheme editions. The bridge assertion states that source fact `SubkindOfObtains(PassengerCar, Vehicle; sourceRS)` is preserved by target fact `SubkindOfObtains(PassengerTransportUnit, TransportUnit; targetRS)`, while the EV distinction is collapsed; it records `CL^k=2`, the lost battery-health invariants, and definedness limited to `registryAPI v1.4` in the selected time window. A candidate is classified only by `J(candidate, TransportUnit, transportUnitEdition, TargetSlice)` or the more specific target judgment when that receiving use is current. The independent scope-bridge and kind-bridge reliance penalties reduce R; F and G are unchanged.

#### C.3.3:9.2 - AuthenticatedRequest across services (software)

Source and target `AuthenticatedRequest` kinds and their exact declaration editions are independently identified. The bridge mapping predicate states the `authHeader` to `x-auth` correspondence and preservation of the signature-validity invariant; the bridge assertion gives `CL^k=3` and its definedness under `AuthStandard v2.3`. It does not construct the target declaration. The frontend evaluates each exact request with its target signature edition and slice; unavailable target dependencies yield `unknown`.

#### C.3.3:9.3 - AdultPatient across jurisdictions (clinical)

The obtaining bridge relates source kind `AdultPatient` to independently identified target kind `AdultPerson_Y`. Its assertion gives `CL^k=1`, states the 18-versus-21 boundary loss, and limits definedness to the declared jurisdictional editions. The target classification uses its own signature edition. Missing DOB support yields `unknown`; a mask adapter or narrower Scope may support a later use, while the guard's refusal and R penalty remain separate from target truth.

### C.3.3:10 - Anti‑patterns & Remedies (informative)

| Anti‑pattern                                 | Why it’s wrong                         | Remedy                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One “interop score” for both kind & scope    | Blurs channels; corrupts penalties     | Use **two bridges**; apply **Φ(CL)** (Scope) and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** (Kind) **separately** |
| Claiming preserved `⊑` while inverting order | Makes typed reasoning unsound          | Mark as **not preserved**; add **loss note**; consider adapter or subkind redesign  |
| Hiding collapses                             | Overstates coverage                    | List collapsed subkinds explicitly; plan extra **R** for lost granularity           |
| Implicit latest mapping | Non-deterministic and non-auditable | Pin both scheme editions and the mapping-rule edition in the bridge assertion; outside bridge definedness decline the cross-context use without changing the target judgment. |
| Using KindBridge to widen G                  | Conflates entityOfConcern with applicability | Keep Scope edits in **USM** (ΔG±); KindBridge never widens Scope                    |
| Adjusting F/G for poor `CL^k`                 | Violates F–G–R & USM separation             | Route consequences to **R** only; consider narrowing Scope or adding adapters       |

### C.3.3:11 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **KB-01** | One obtaining KindBridge relation has exact source-kind and target-kind participants; signatures, assertions, evidence, CL, loss notes, and slices are not participants. |
| **KB-02** | A KindBridge does not map Scope; USM owns scope translation and its separate bridge occurrence. |
| **KB-03** | Participants, direction, source/target scheme editions, obtaining predicate, definedness, and participant-plus-scheme occurrence identity are recoverable; signature, mapping-rule, assertion, card, row, and publication editions remain separate epistemic objects and trigger reevaluation rather than automatic relation reidentification. |
| **KB-04** | Target classification is the exact four-input C.3.2 judgment under fixed inputs; a source result is not target truth and `unknown` remains distinct from guard refusal. |
| **KB-05** | A preservation assertion names the exact source order fact, both mapped target kinds and their obtaining KindBridge relations, and the target `SubkindOfObtains` fact; an `R_sub` designator appears only for an occurrence-consuming use. |
| **KB-06** | A bridge assertion does not claim preservation when target order inverts the source relation; inversion is non-preservation with loss, while unsettled target order remains `unknown`. |
| **KB-07** | Collapses designate the affected source order relations and lost properties without rewriting either local order. |
| **KB-08** | `CL^k` is an assessment in the bridge assertion, labeled kind-congruence; neither it nor the relation alters KindAT. |
| **KB-09** | Reliance on the bridge and target judgment applies `Ψ(CL^k)` to R only; F, G, and judgment truth are unchanged. |
| **KB-10** | Chained reliance uses the weakest `CL^k` assessment while keeping each bridge occurrence and assertion distinct. |
| **KB-11** | Loss notes state non-preserved signature invariants and subkind relations and do not change the kinds. |
| **KB-12** | Bridge definedness is explicit; outside it the guard declines that bridge use while the independent target judgment keeps its own value. |

**Integration requirements with Part B (bridges):**

* **B-P1.** Part B (Bridges) SHALL distinguish the kind channel—reliance on an obtaining C.3.3 `KindBridge` direct relation plus its separate bridge assertion—from USM scope and F.9 sense-Bridge channels. A Bridge Card or bridge-class row does not become the `KindBridge` occurrence.
* **B‑P2.** Part B **SHALL** state that **`CL^k` penalties route to R** via a monotone **Ψ**, never to **F/G**.
* **B‑P3.** Part B **SHALL** define **chaining = min** for both **CL** and **`CL^k`** (weakest‑link).
* **Templates.** ESG/Method templates should expose references to the exact relied-on Scope-Bridge and `KindBridge` relation/assertion pairs. `CL`, `CL^k`, loss notes, and definedness remain assertion or assessment content; template fields neither create nor identify the world-side relation by record identity.

### C.3.3:End
