## C.32.P2S - Problem-to-Structure Architecturing Unfolding

> **Type:** Architectural process pattern under C.32
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### C.32.P2S:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when an architect or architecture-responsible practitioner starts from architecture-relevant problem pressure that needs to stay connected through selected structures, candidate synthesis, project architecture decision, realization work, actual-structure feedback, and the next governed action.

The common first moment is practical: a required function has no recoverable bearer; an architecture characteristic is failing; a cross-scope residual survives local repair; a modularity, reuse, interface, scale, or description-loss problem blocks action; a transformer holon cannot yet produce the desired transformed holon; or operation shows that expected structures and actual structures diverge.

The first useful output is `ProblemToStructureArchitecturingFlowCard@Project`. The card is a working record of one architecturing flow. It is not a new `U` kind, not an architecture claim, not an architecture decision, not a work plan, not an eval result, and not a publication format. It keeps the connected flow reviewable while each local object remains governed by the pattern that governs the current claim.

For the first pass, fill only the fields that prevent the next wrong move: described holon, bounded context, problem pressure, first governing pattern, one unknown or selected structure slot, and governing pattern for the next claim. Add decision, work, eval, publication, and feedback refs only when the flow reaches the pattern that governs them.

For `ProblemToStructureArchitecturingFlowCard@Project`, `@Project` is a compatibility and retrieval cue only. It establishes no project entity, composite-work identity, context, authority, viewpoint, or parthood. When the card is genuinely used in one actual project, `projectWorkOccurrenceRef` identifies the exact composite Work occurrence admitted under `U.Work` and `architecturingFlowCardProjectUseRelationRef` identifies the direct relation by which architecturing work uses the card. The card, the architecturing work it helps coordinate, and the larger project work remain distinct.

The realization refs are pointers to independently governed objects, not P2S relation kinds. `actualTransformationRefs` resolve only to actual bounded changes independently grounded and identified under `A.3.4`; `directWorkToChangeGovernorRefs` resolve to exact direct subject relations or local claims selected under `A.6.RCD` disposition 2. The three production refs resolve to separate local `A.15.PROD` claims and remain absent when their particular question is not current. `actualStructureRefs` name subject-side `U.Structure` values whose declared substrate and selected relation organization are recovered under `A.22` from directly governed facts that actually obtain; they introduce neither an `ActualStructure` kind nor an actualization relation. `C.30` governs only the corresponding `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim over selected structure refs. `actualStructureDescriptionRefs` name later descriptions of those structures and do not make them actual.

Not this pattern when the current work is only a problem card, only a grounded architecture claim, only a structural view, only a candidate palette, only a project architecture decision, only an ADR-like publication, only work planning, only performed work, only measurement, only a mathematical lens, or only `G.11` currentness, freshness, telemetry, edition, or decay orchestration. Use the pattern named in `Relations` for that narrower claim.

### C.32.P2S:2 - Problem

FPF has direct governing patterns for problem records, grounded architecture, structural views, candidate palettes, architecture characteristics, eval programs, decisions, ADR-like projections, methods, Work occurrences, separate method descriptions and work-record epistemes, measurements, mathematical lenses, improvement loops, and currentness or decay orchestration. A practitioner still needs one readable pattern for the architecture work that connects them.

Without C.32.P2S, architecture work can fail in two opposite ways.

First, the flow collapses into a description or decision artifact: a diagram, view set, ADR, memo, dashboard, score, or publication record is treated as if it carried the architecture, the decision, and the realized structure. The project then loses the distinction between selected structure, description, decision, method expectation, performed work, and actual structure.

Second, the flow disappears into relation rows: every local governing pattern is correct, but no pattern tells the architect how to move from pressure and structural uncertainty to candidate structures, selection, realization, feedback, and the next governed action. The user can name patterns but cannot carry the architecture problem through work.

### C.32.P2S:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|---|---|
| Structure-first architecture | Architecture is selected structures of a described holon in a bounded context; the flow is not reducible to documents, labels, stages, or tools. |
| Structural uncertainty | Architecturing often starts before structure kinds, bearers, interfaces, allocations, or variation points are known. |
| Characteristic trade-off | Architecture characteristics compete; optimizing one can damage another or hide Goodhart pressure behind a metric. |
| Candidate plurality | Useful architecture work keeps structurally different alternatives alive until a comparison, selected-set, local choice, or architecture decision pattern is current. |
| Realization gap | Selected and expected structures do not become actual structures by decision, model, description, or matching labels. Domain work, independently grounded actual changes, exact work-to-change facts, and separately governed subject-side structure facts are needed before an actual structure is claimed. |
| Transformer constraint | The holon that changes another holon has its own work, method, role, tool, communication, evidence, and placement structures that can enable or block the desired transformed architecture. |
| Description loss | Views, descriptions, decision records, method descriptions, and eval reports capture only part of the structural content needed for later use. |
| Evolution and feedback | Operation, use, telemetry, inspection, eval, decay, and new sources can return the work to the pattern that governs the next claim: `C.32` synthesis, `C.32.PAD` or `C.32.ADA` repair or supersession, `E.23` improvement, `G.11` currentness refresh, `E.18` transformation-flow slice-local refresh, `C.18` or `C.19` archive, front, and pool update, or `C.30.AD` or `C.30.ASV` repair for architecture-description or structural-view loss. |

### C.32.P2S:4 - Solution

Create or update one `ProblemToStructureArchitecturingFlowCard@Project` and move through the smallest useful spine below. Stop at the first pattern that fully governs the current claim; continue the P2S card only while the connected architecture flow remains the current object needing review.

Use the analogy with `E.18.1` P2W narrowly. P2W carries an accepted problem-side record or accepted `ProblemCard@Context` plus the carried distinction into a next governed FPF use. C.32.P2S carries architecture-relevant pressure and structural uncertainty into candidate structures, selected structures, project architecture decision, realization work, actual-structure feedback, and governing-pattern-specific next actions. The analogy ends when the current claim is method, work, telemetry, publication, or improvement-loop governance; then use the receiving governing pattern rather than stretching P2S into generic process management.

1. Recover the problem pressure or architecture concern. Name the pressure kind, problem-pressure signals, any source-use records, affected holon, and the first governing pattern. If the pressure is still only a problem-side signal, use `C.22.2` before P2S continues.
2. Recover the described holon, bounded context, candidate or selected structure kinds, selected structures when available, and architecture characteristics. Use `C.30` for the grounded architecture claim, `C.32.HCS` for starter characteristic heads, `C.32.ACS` for project criteria rows, and `C.25` when a composite quality family is current.
3. Represent future-structure uncertainty. State unknown structure kinds, unknown internal composition, candidate bearers, interfaces, allocations, variation points, constraints, expected structures, and the condition that returns the work to stronger inspection of the selected or expected structure. Record what is captured, handed off, latent, hidden, or lost.
4. Generate architecture ideas, principles, constraints, and candidate structure changes. Use an admitted problem-side record, source-pack cue, architecture pressure note, or candidate-generation input only after the affected selected structure, architecture characteristic, expected gain, accepted loss, and receiving governing pattern are recoverable.
5. Synthesize candidate architecture configurations and candidate sets through `C.32`. Keep function-bearing feasibility, constructive modules, placement, control, transformation-flow, work, role, information, evidence, scale, and other selected structures visible when they change the candidate.
6. Compare, retain, publish, or return alternatives through the pattern that governs the set relation. Use `A.19.CPM` for explicit comparison, `A.19.SelectorMechanism` for set-returning selection, `C.18` and `C.19` for archive, front, and pool policy, `G.5` for publication of a selected set, and `C.11` for a fixed local choice.
7. Make a project architecture decision through `C.32.PAD` when implementation commitment is current. The decision relation names the selected architecture option, affected structures, trade-off, accepted losses, method and work consequences, accepted lost-structure return, and decision repair or supersession condition.
8. Publish descriptions, views, ADR-like records, narrative renderings, or other records only as descriptions, structure-to-narrative renderings, or publication forms of structures, decision relations, method expectations, description or view loss repair, and reader use. Use `C.30.AD`, `C.30.ASV`, `C.32.ADR`, `A.6.3.NAR`, `E.17`, and `E.24.PUB` as applicable.
9. Hand transformer roles the method descriptions, constraints, readiness expectations, work expectations, and structure-use return conditions needed to realize selected structures. Use `A.15`, `A.15.2`, and `A.15.5` for method, work-plan, and readiness claims.
10. Realize selected structures in the transformed holon through domain work without treating the selected or expected structure, decision, method, `MethodDescription`, `WorkPlan`, model, description, evaluation result, publication, or transfer as the actual structure or as an actual transformation. Use `A.15.1` for each exact dated work occurrence. Use `A.3.4` for each independently identified actual bounded change, and cite the exact direct work-to-change governor or a local claim selected under `A.6.RCD` disposition 2 whenever exact work is asserted to cause or realize that change. Use separate local `A.15.PROD` claims only when production-work participation, entity-identity inception, or historically indexed production completion is current. The P2S card records refs; it performs none of the work and derives none of those claims.
11. Observe, inspect, measure, and evaluate subject-side `U.Structure` values whose declared substrate and selected relation organization are recovered under `A.22` from directly governed facts that actually obtain, together with architecture-characteristic results and functional-characteristic or capability implications in operation or use. Ask whether those actual structures enable or block the functions and effects they were meant to bear, and ask what selected structure, accepted loss, counter-characteristic, or functional implication got worse when a visible metric improved. A description, measurement, evaluation result, publication, or resemblance to the selected structure does not itself make a structure actual or establish conformance. Use `C.30` only for the corresponding subject-side `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim, `C.30.AD` or `C.30.ASV` for actual-structure descriptions or views, `C.32.ACE` for eval programs and eval results, `C.16` for measurement, and `C.25` for Q-bundles. Use `E.23` when repeated improvement method is current, `G.11` when currentness, telemetry, edition, freshness, or decay orchestration is current, `E.18` for transformation-flow slice-local refresh, `C.18` or `C.19` for archive, front, and pool updates, `C.32.PAD` or `C.32.ADA` for decision repair or supersession, `C.32` for new synthesis, and `C.30.AD` or `C.30.ASV` for architecture-description or structural-view loss repair. Feed actual-structure divergence, eval results, functional implications, freshness loss, description or view loss, and new constraints into the return or repair action governed by the receiving pattern.

At the realization boundary, keep selected structure, expected structure, actual subject-side structure, exact dated work, independently identified actual transformations, local production claims, actual-structure description, and evaluation result as different objects. Shared assembly work, temporal adjacency, common affected referents, one flow, or one selected configuration establishes neither one composite transformation nor absence of finer transformation parts. If a receiving claim requires transformation composition, return the exact missing-governor blocker; do not use that blocker to stop independent work, inception, completion, actual-structure, description, evaluation, or return claims.

When one holon changes another holon, add the transformer/transformed branch before candidate synthesis becomes narrow. Name the changing relation, the transformer holon, the transformed holon, and selected structures on both sides when they constrain the candidate set. Use `C.32.CONWAY` to frame candidate families: change transformer-side structures, change transformed-side structures, change both, or declare a bounded mismatch with the named correspondence or decision-repair return condition.

#### C.32.P2S:4.1 - P2S Unfolding Structure Block

When the P2S card must remain reusable across decision, description, work, and feedback governing patterns, add this local block. `P2SUnfoldingStructureBlock` is an architecture-facing local `A.22.CGUS` `U.Structure` specialization block governed here for problem-to-structure architecturing use. It is not a root U-kind, not an architecture decision, not an ADR, not an architecture description, and not a work plan by itself.

```text
P2SUnfoldingStructureBlock:
  unfoldingStructureRef: current architecture-facing ConstraintGovernedUnfoldingStructure record
  problemPressureRef:
  selectedOrUnknownStructureRefs[]:
  architectureContentLoci[]:
  structuralUncertaintyLoci[]:
  candidateSynthesisLoci[]:
  decisionLinkageRef?:
  realizationWorkLinkageRef?:
  actualTransformationRefs[]?:
  directWorkToChangeGovernorRefs[]?:
  productionWorkClaimRefs[]?:
  entityIdentityInceptionClaimRefs[]?:
  productionCompletionClaimRefs[]?:
  actualStructureFeedbackRef?:
  e18TransformationFlowUnfoldingRefs[]?:
  descriptionRefs[]?:
  blockedOverread: not architecture decision, not ADR, not work plan by itself
```

The block is useful when the architecture work has to show how problem pressure constrains candidate, selected, expected, or actual structures without hiding which pattern governs the next claim. `unfoldingStructureRef` names the current CGUS record or local architecture-facing structure block; an A.22-level narrower-specialization relation, when needed, remains `specializedStructureRef?` on the A.22.CGUS record. `decisionLinkageRef` points to `C.32.PAD` only when a project architecture decision is current. `descriptionRefs[]` point to `C.30.AD`, `C.30.ASV`, `C.32.ADR`, `A.6.3.NAR`, or publication governing patterns only when a description, view, ADR projection, narrative rendering, or publication claim is current. `realizationWorkLinkageRef` points to the exact A.15-family work relation; actual transformations and direct work-to-change governors retain their `A.3.4`, direct-subject, or `A.6.RCD` owners. The three production-ref groups point only to separate local `A.15.PROD` claims. The P2S block neither authorizes nor records performed work and does not make selected or expected structure actual.

Use `e18TransformationFlowUnfoldingRefs[]` only for slices whose substrate is transformation-flow structure. P2S itself is broader: it can carry module, functional, placement, control, role, method, evidence, scale, information, and other architecture-relevant structures through architecture synthesis and feedback.

#### C.32.P2S:4.2 - Architecture Unfolding Structure Use

Use `ArchitectureUnfoldingStructureUse@Project` when a named constraint-governed unfolding structure is being used as architecture-relevant structure inside problem-to-structure architecturing. This is a dependent architecture-use relation record owned here and by the relevant C.30 or C.32 architecture pattern. It is not a root U-kind, not an architecture decision, not an architecture description, not an ADR projection, and not realization work.

```text
ArchitectureUnfoldingStructureUse@Project:
  kind: dependent architecture-use relation record under C.32.P2S, C.30, and adjacent architecture governing patterns
  projectWorkOccurrenceRef?: U.EntityRef constrained to an individual admitted under U.Work
  architectureQuestionRef:
  architectureOfRef:
  unfoldingStructureRef:
  architectureStructureUseKind:
    transformationFlow |

  architectureCharacteristicRefs[]:
  acceptedLosses[]:
  methodOrWorkLinkageRefs[]?:
  architectureDecisionRef?:
  architectureDescriptionRefs[]?:
  architectureUseReturnCondition:
  repairOrSupersessionCondition:
```

For `ArchitectureUnfoldingStructureUse@Project`, the suffix again remains only a compatibility and retrieval cue. When `projectWorkOccurrenceRef` is filled, it designates the exact composite Work occurrence admitted under `U.Work` that is an explicit participant in this architecture-use relation; when it is absent, no project locality is asserted. `architectureQuestionRef` and `architectureOfRef` name the architecture question and described holon in bounded context. `unfoldingStructureRef` names the CGUS or local block being used. `affectedSelectedStructures[]`, `architectureCharacteristicRefs[]`, and `acceptedLosses[]` state why the unfolding structure matters for architecture rather than for a generic route. Method and work refs point to the A.15 family only as realization or feedback linkage. Decisions, descriptions, ADR-like projections, measurements, evals, evidence, gates, publication, and performed work still exit to their direct governing patterns.

Stop conditions:

- stop at `C.22.2` when the signal is not yet a reviewable problem-side record;
- stop at `C.30` or `C.30.ASV` when the current need is only architecture claim or structural-view adequacy;
- stop at `C.32` when the next useful artifact is a candidate palette rather than a whole P2S carry-through record;
- stop at `C.32.PAD` when the project architecture decision is current;
- stop at the A.15 family when the current question is method, work planning, readiness, or performed work;
- stop at `C.16`, `C.25`, `C.29`, `C.32.ACE`, `E.23`, or `G.11` when the current claim is measurement, quality-bundle, mathematical-lens, eval, improvement, or `G.11` currentness refresh;
- return to P2S only when a later governing pattern returns architecture pressure that changes candidate structures, expected structures, actual structures, selected structures, or the stronger-structure inspection return condition.

### C.32.P2S:5 - Archetypal Grounding

**Tell.** A capable architect does not merely "document the architecture." The architect carries pressure into structure: first by finding which selected structures are missing or inadequate, then by constructing alternatives, deciding what will be pursued, enabling exact domain work, and watching which subject-side structures actually obtain under operation. An actual transformation is introduced only when its own `A.3.4` basis is grounded.

**First-minute use slice.** A plant architect sees that expected throughput and actual throughput diverge after a layout change. The first P2S card pass names the production cell as described holon, the operating shift as bounded context, pressure kind `actualStructureDivergesFromExpectedStructure`, first governing pattern `C.30`, unknown structure `material-flow bottleneck bearer`, selected structure candidate `buffer placement`, and governing pattern for the next claim `C.32`. The card does not yet add a PAD decision, work plan, or eval result; those refs appear only after their governing patterns become current.

**Lens-use slice.** If the plant team builds a DSM or epiplexity-style lens over stations, buffers, and routing events, P2S records only the architecture use: which dependency or learnable structural content was preserved, which flow distinction was compressed away, which selected structures the lens can inform, and which lens-use return condition sends the claim back to `C.29`. The lens result is not architecture adequacy, an eval result, or a decision.

**Show A - built asset and technical system.** A clinic has rising instrument-turnaround delays and infection-control pressure. The first P2S move does not ask for a better diagram. It names the described holon, bounded context, candidate structure kinds, architecture characteristics, and uncertainty: room layout, sterile and contaminated flows, equipment modules, tray interface, maintenance work, throughput, contamination isolation, maintainability, and surge adaptability. Candidate synthesis compares a centralized autoclave bay, distributed sterilization modules, and a reusable tray-interface change. `C.32.PAD` decides a selected configuration, `C.30.AD` and `C.32.ADR` publish the decision and views, A.15-family records guide construction and operating work, and operation measures actual turnaround, contamination events, maintenance burden, and actual-structure feedback triggers.

**Show B - organization and role/method structures.** Inspection work catches ontological errors late. The source may call the object a review practice, but P2S first restores the claim: the described holon is the review organization-as-system or bounded review-work context; the adjacent governed structures include role relation structure, method relation structure, method descriptions, evidence handoffs, decision records, and live attention cues. Architecture characteristics include error containment, learnability, throughput, evidence reuse, and repair locality. Candidate synthesis compares a single checker role assignment, a split intake and ontology-checking role relation structure, and a live-beat microstep method relation structure. The project architecture decision binds those selected structures to method descriptions and readiness checks. Later inspection work and telemetry show whether errors are caught earlier or whether the selected method-side or role-side structures need repair.

**Show C - transformer and transformed co-synthesis.** A team wants a modular product architecture but its toolchain, team communication, release method, and evidence workflow only support one tightly coupled build. P2S uses `C.32.CONWAY`: transformer-side structures and transformed-side product structures are both candidate variables. Candidate families include changing the product modules only, changing the team and toolchain only, changing both, or accepting a bounded mismatch while retaining a named correspondence-frame return condition. The decision states which side changes now, what architecture characteristics are protected, what work realizes the change, and what operation or delivery feedback can return to the `C.32.CONWAY` correspondence frame or to decision repair.

**Show D - PumpSkid 7 realization and return.** Architecture pressure calls for a modular pump-skid with selected module and placement structures; `C.32.PAD` governs the project architecture decision. Exact assembly work `W-PS7-ASSEMBLY` and later commissioning work `W-PS7-COMMISSION` are separate Work occurrences admitted under `U.Work` by `A.15.1`. Mounting change `T-PS7-MOUNT`, wiring change `T-PS7-WIRE`, fluid-connection change `T-PS7-CONNECT`, and commissioning-related change `T-PS7-COMMISSION` are each independently identified under `A.3.4`, with exact work-to-change governors where the assembly or commissioning work is asserted to cause them. Shared work, temporal adjacency, and one selected pump-skid configuration do not establish one composite transformation. The local `A.15.PROD` entity-identity-inception claim uses the applicable PumpSkid 7 identity-specification edition, its direct applicability basis, exact work-to-change and change-to-identity facts, and `inceptionBoundary`; it need not assert a composite transformation. Later commissioning can remain production work until exact subject-state facts at `completionBoundary` satisfy the applicable production-completion-criterion edition; only then can a separate historically indexed completion claim be written. A later `C.30.AD` or `C.30.ASV` record describes the actual structure; `C.32.ACE` evaluates service-access coupling. When coupling is worse than the selected expectation, the eval result returns to decision repair or new synthesis. Neither the description, evaluation, identity-inception claim, completion claim, nor shared assembly work proves conformance to the selected architecture or transformation composition.

### C.32.P2S:6 - Bias-Annotation

Use these rows as repair cues for problem pressure, source-practice transfer, or observed signals, not as a catalogue of mistakes.

| Pressure cue or source-practice row | Risk in P2S use | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| Description-first pressure cue | A view, model, diagram, ADR-like record, dashboard, or memo starts to carry architecture, decision, and work authority at once. | Recover selected structures and current use. Send description adequacy to `C.30.AD` or `C.30.ASV`, decision to `C.32.PAD`, projection to `C.32.ADR`, and work claims to A.15-family patterns. |
| Single-winner pressure cue | A score, workshop favorite, generated candidate, or apparent best alternative hides structurally different candidates. | Restore candidate plurality through `C.32`; keep archive, front, pool, selected-set, comparison, local-choice, or decision use with its governing pattern. |
| Eval-shaped practice row or signal | A metric, benchmark, source-practice fitness-function term, eval result, or telemetry event is treated as the characteristic or the decision. | Recover characteristic, bearer, scale, eval program, measurement, and receiving use. Use `C.32.ACE`, `C.16`, `C.25`, and then the comparison, selected-set, local-choice, or decision governing pattern. |
| Transformer-hidden pressure cue | Desired transformed-holon architecture is stated without asking whether the changing holon can produce it. | Open `C.32.CONWAY`; name changing relation, transformer, transformed holon, selected structures on both sides, affected characteristics, candidate changes, and bounded mismatch condition. |
| Work-shaped pressure cue | A schedule, task list, method recipe, performed-work record, shared assembly occurrence, or completion label is treated as the architecturing flow, an actual transformation, a composite transformation, or proof that selected structure is actual. | Keep work governing patterns intact. P2S cites exact Work occurrences, independently grounded changes, direct work-to-change governors, separate local `A.15.PROD` claims, and actual-structure facts only when they obtain; common work or chronology supplies none of the stronger claims. |

### C.32.P2S:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| `CC-C32P2S-1` | The card names described holon, bounded context, problem pressure, first governing pattern, and at least one architecture-relevant structure or unknown-structure slot. |
| `CC-C32P2S-2` | The architecture claim, when made, is grounded through `C.30` over selected structures of the described holon; no description or publication record carries the architecture by itself. |
| `CC-C32P2S-3` | Architecture characteristics are separate from functional demands, measurements, eval programs, eval results, Q-bundles, comparison rules, and decisions. |
| `CC-C32P2S-4` | The structural-information slots in the P2S card record unknown, selected, expected, actual, captured, handed-off, latent or hidden, lost, and returned structure when those slots are live. |
| `CC-C32P2S-5` | Candidate synthesis exits to `C.32`, comparison and selection claims exit to their governing patterns, and the P2S card does not choose a winner by score or prose preference. |
| `CC-C32P2S-6` | A project architecture decision, when current, exits to `C.32.PAD`; ADR-like publication exits to `C.32.ADR` and publication governing patterns. |
| `CC-C32P2S-7` | Method, `MethodDescription`, work-plan, readiness, and performed-work claims exit to A.15-family governing patterns. Every actual transformation is independently grounded under `A.3.4`; every claimed work-to-change link resolves through its exact direct governor or a local claim selected under `A.6.RCD` disposition 2; production-work, entity-identity-inception, and production-completion refs point to separate local `A.15.PROD` claims. The P2S card carries refs and expected structure effects only. |
| `CC-C32P2S-8` | Measurement, Q-bundle, mathematical-lens, eval, improvement, `G.11` currentness refresh, and `E.18` transformation-flow slice-local refresh claims exit to `C.16`, `C.25`, `C.29`, `C.32.ACE`, `E.23`, `G.11`, or `E.18`. |
| `CC-C32P2S-9` | Transformer/transformed cases name the changing relation, both holons, selected structures on both sides when load-bearing, and the `C.32.CONWAY` correspondence frame. |
| `CC-C32P2S-10` | The pattern use covers at least one actual-structure feedback route that checks subject-side `U.Structure` values recovered under `A.22` from directly governed obtaining facts, architecture-characteristic results, and relevant functional-characteristic or capability implications through operation, use, inspection, measurement, eval result, telemetry, decay, stronger-structure inspection return, or decision-repair trigger. |
| `CC-C32P2S-11` | Selected and expected structures, methods, plans, models, decisions, descriptions, evaluation results, publications, and transfers remain distinct from actual structures and actual transformations. Resemblance does not establish conformance. Shared work, adjacency, common referents, or one flow establishes neither transformation composition nor partlessness. |
| `CC-C32P2S-12` | The PumpSkid 7 replay independently identifies mounting, wiring, connection, and commissioning-related changes; cites exact assembly and commissioning work plus work-to-change governors; separates entity-identity inception from later historically indexed production completion; and routes actual-structure description, architecture-characteristic evaluation, and return without fabricating conformance or one composite transformation. |

### C.32.P2S:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| Description stop | The project stops after producing a view set, diagram, ADR-like record, or architecture description even though no candidate structure, decision, realization, or feedback path is recoverable. | Return to step 2 or 5. Name selected or unknown structures, architecture characteristics, and the next governing pattern: `C.30`, `C.30.ASV`, `C.32`, or `C.32.PAD`. |
| Relation index P2S | The P2S artifact lists neighboring patterns but does not tell the architect what to do from pressure to subject-side actual structures recovered from directly governed obtaining facts. | Write the positive action spine in the card: pressure, structural uncertainty, candidates, retention or selection, decision, descriptions, method and work handoff, exact work, actual changes, subject-side actual structures, feedback, and governing-pattern-specific return. |
| Eval-as-decision | An eval result, score, metric, telemetry event, or dashboard value selects the architecture. | Route the eval to `C.32.ACE`, measurement to `C.16`, and composite quality to `C.25`; ask what selected structure, accepted loss, counter-characteristic, or functional implication worsened; then use comparison, selected-set, local-choice, or `C.32.PAD` if selection or decision is current. |
| Hidden transformer | The transformed holon is designed as if the changing holon has no architecture. | Open the transformer/transformed branch and `C.32.CONWAY`; add candidate families that change transformer-side structures, transformed-side structures, both, or a bounded mismatch. |
| Lost structure left silent | The description, decision, method handoff, or eval report compresses away distinctions needed for later work. | Fill the P2S structural-information slots: what is captured, handed off, latent or hidden, lost, and what stronger-structure inspection return condition restores the selected or expected structure needed by the next claim. |
| Work governing-pattern takeover | P2S prose starts authorizing Work occurrences or replacing method, readiness, WorkPlan, or separate assertion/record epistemes about performed work. | Keep P2S as architecture carry-through. Send method and work claims to A.15-family patterns and keep in the P2S card only references plus expected selected-structure effects. |
| Selected structure treated as actual | A decision, model, description, view, evaluation result, or matching label is used as proof that the selected structure obtains. | Recover the exact subject-side `U.Structure` under `A.22` from its declared substrate and directly governed obtaining relation, constraint, invariant, or other selected-organization facts; use `C.30` only for the corresponding `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim. Keep description and evaluation separately governed and test conformance only through its direct owner. |
| Common work treated as one composite transformation | Mounting, wiring, connection, or commissioning changes are merged because one assembly work occurrence, selected configuration, or time interval contains them. | Identify every actual transformation independently under `A.3.4`; cite direct work-to-change facts; return the exact missing-governor blocker if the receiving claim needs transformation composition. |

### C.32.P2S:9 - Consequences

The project gains one replayable architecturing flow from pressure to actual-structure feedback. Practitioners can see where the work currently stands and which governing pattern governs the next claim, without treating descriptions, decisions, eval results, Work occurrences, or separate records about them as interchangeable.

The cost is disciplined record work: the card preserves structural uncertainty, candidate plurality, accepted losses, handoffs, and stronger-structure inspection return. If that cost is not justified because the question is already governed by one narrower pattern, use that pattern directly and do not open P2S.

The pattern improves cross-holon and adjacent-governed-structure reuse. The same spine works for admitted holons such as systems, built assets, product families, organizations-as-systems, epistemes, AI-agent setups, disciplines, and C.36-recovered cultural-evolution cases. When architecture pressure concerns roles, methods, practices, cultures, traditions, or styles, the described holon and bounded context are named separately, while role values, role relation structures, method values, method relation structures, method descriptions, work claims, canon or memory epistemes, recognition and selection regimes, and mediation-system claims stay with their direct governing patterns.

The pattern does not guarantee adequacy. It makes the architecturing flow inspectable. Candidate quality, decision adequacy, evidence, assurance, gate passage, release, measurement validity, and `G.11` currentness refresh still require their governing patterns.

### C.32.P2S:10 - Rationale

C.32.P2S belongs under C.32 because its central architecturing concern is architecture synthesis: recovering problem pressure and structural uncertainty, generating candidate selected-structure changes, preserving alternatives, making decision-ready content, and returning actual-structure feedback to the next synthesis question. This architecturing concern is not itself a `U.Transformation`; any actual bounded change during realization remains independently governed by `A.3.4`.

It cannot be only a C.22 pattern because a problem card does not carry architecture synthesis, decision, realization, and feedback. It cannot be only a C.30 pattern because grounded architecture and structural-view adequacy do not themselves construct candidate palettes or govern downstream work. It cannot be only a C.32 pattern because the palette is only one stage of the larger architecturing flow. It cannot be only C.32.PAD or C.32.ADR because decisions and records do not create the candidate space and do not realize structures. It cannot be only A.15 or E.18.1 because method and work carry-through and P2W do not govern architecture candidate synthesis or selected-structure decision content.

The P2S structural-information slots are selected now because otherwise P2S cannot explain what changes. Architecturing refines uncertainty about future structures into candidate, selected, expected, and actual structures, while descriptions, decisions, methods, Work occurrences, separate records about them, and eval reports capture only part of that content. The practitioner records which structural content is captured by descriptions, decisions, method handoffs, references to Work occurrences, separate work-record epistemes, evals, and measurements; which structure remains latent, hidden, or lost; and which stronger-structure inspection return condition returns the work to stronger structure inspection, description or view loss repair, decision repair, or a `C.29` lens use such as epiplexity, DSM, graph, coarse-graining, equivalence, or morphism.

### C.32.P2S:12 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `C.22.2` for problem-side recovery, `C.30`, `C.30.AD`, and `C.30.ASV` for grounded architecture, architecture-description adequacy, and structural-view adequacy, `C.33`, `C.34`, and `C.35` for structural-information capture, preservation, and generated or discovered carrier adequacy inside the flow, `C.32` for candidate architecture synthesis, `C.32.HCS`, `C.32.ACS`, and `C.32.ACE` for characteristic starter heads, project criteria rows, and eval programs, `C.25` for Q-bundles, `C.31` family patterns for modularity, reusable structure, and scale preference, `C.29` for mathematical-lens use when claimed, and `E.17` and `E.24.PUB` for publication-face and publication-use claims.
- **Uses:** `A.22.CGUS` for the P2S unfolding-structure block when problem pressure, structure uncertainty, candidate synthesis, decision linkage, work linkage, and actual-structure feedback must remain inspectable as one constraint-governed unfolding structure; `E.18.3`, `C.30.TFS-REL`, `E.18`, and `A.3.4` when architecture pressure concerns transformation-flow or bounded change; `C.30.ILC`, `C.32.MLAO`, and `B.2` family patterns when cross-scope, interlevel, interlayer, meta-holon, emergence, or reidentification pressure changes the candidate frame; `C.32.CONWAY` when co-synthesis of transformer and transformed architectures is current; `C.32.FAIL` when a recognizable architecture-synthesis failure becomes a repair action.
- **Receiving patterns:** `A.19.CPM`, `A.19.SelectorMechanism`, `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.5`, and `C.11` for comparison, selection, archive, front, pool policy, publication of a selected set, and local choice; `C.32.PAD`, `C.32.ADR`, and `C.32.ADA` for project architecture decision, ADR-like projection, and decision adequacy; `C.30.AD`, `A.6.3.NAR`, `E.17`, and `E.24.PUB` for architecture descriptions, architecture-mediated narrative renderings, publication faces, and publication-use claims; `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, and `A.15.5` for method, performed work, work plan, and readiness; `A.3.4` for each actual bounded change; direct subject patterns or `A.6.RCD` for exact work-to-change governors and blockers; `A.15.PROD` for separate local production-work, entity-identity-inception, and production-completion claims; `C.16`, `C.25`, `C.29`, `C.32.ACE`, `E.23`, `G.11`, and `E.18` for measurement, Q-bundle, mathematical lens, eval, improvement, `G.11` currentness refresh, and `E.18` transformation-flow slice-local refresh.
- **Boundary:** C.32.P2S governs the connected architecturing flow from architecture-relevant pressure to subject-side actual structures recovered under `A.22` from directly governed obtaining facts and to feedback. `C.33`, `C.34`, and `C.35` deepen the structural-information slot group already present in P2S; they do not move the whole architecturing spine out of P2S. C.32.P2S does not replace any governing pattern for architecture claim, architecture description, structural view, candidate palette, comparison, selected-set publication, decision, ADR-like publication, publication form, publication-use claim, method, work, measurement, eval, evidence, assurance, gate, release, improvement, `G.11` currentness refresh, or formal structural-information theory.

### C.32.P2S:13 - Footer marker

`C.32.P2S` governs one reader-facing problem-to-structure architecturing flow: pressure and structural uncertainty are carried into candidate, selected, and expected structures, then through exact domain work to independently grounded actual changes and subject-side actual structures, with descriptions, evaluations, and governing-pattern-specific return or repair exits named by value.
