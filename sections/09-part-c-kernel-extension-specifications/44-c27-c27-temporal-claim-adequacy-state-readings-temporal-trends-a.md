## C.27 - Temporal Claim Adequacy: State Readings, Temporal Trends, and Intervention-Sensitive Temporal Change

> **Type:** Claim-adequacy pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**Plain-name.** Temporal claim adequacy.

**Primary EntityOfConcern.** C.27 concerns authored temporal claims: prose, plans, benchmark lines, dashboards, method notes, promises, or explanations that treat state, rate, rhythm, recovery, braking, coasting, redirection, stabilization, or rate-change as sufficient for some practical use.

**Use this pattern when** a claim about speed, rhythm, throughput, recovery, convergence, rollout, adoption, braking, coasting, redirection, or stabilization is being used to change action and therefore must name the temporal reading, effort or intervention, window, resistance or cost, evidence relation or assumption relation, supported use, unsupported use, and reopen condition.

**What this buys.** The reader can separate state readings, rate readings, and intervention-sensitive temporal-change claims before a trend, cadence, benchmark, or speed claim starts authorizing work, gates, promises, budgets, or comparisons.

**Do not use this pattern when** the wording is ordinary prose, a positive temporal aspect with no adequacy question, a state reading or rate reading whose measurement construction is enough, a formal `U.Dynamics` model, an actual work trace, a benchmark harness, a service promise, a quality judgement, or a residual quantum-like probe case without an intervention-sensitive temporal claim.

**C.27 in 60 seconds.** A trend is not yet an intervention model. Use C.27 only if:

1. temporal wording is used to justify action, comparison, budget, gate, promise, assurance, or an explicit relation to another FPF pattern;
2. the difference between state, rate, and rate-change changes supported use;
3. a small card can name the temporal reading or bearer, intervention, window, resistance or cost, evidence relation or assumption relation, supported use, and unsupported downstream claim, effect, use, or reopen trigger.

For local diagnosis or planning, C.27 usually ends with one `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`. Plain references are enough while the use stays local. Boundary-crossing use can require a `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`, but the profile remains a pattern-local authored temporal-claim adequacy record, not the dynamic system, not the work trace, not a publication role, and not the default output.

**Split boundaries.** Use `C.27.TA` to name positive temporal aspects such as time window, freshness, cadence, rhythm, trajectory, recovery timing, stabilization timing, effort over time, inertia, or refresh condition. Use `A.3.4` when the question under repair is the bounded transformation itself. C.27 may judge an authored temporal claim about a transformation, but it does not identify the `U.Transformation` value, supply its slot relation, or turn a temporal reading into evidence, permission, or work.

**Description and support discipline.** The described system, work, practice, method, service, or benchmark is not the C.27 record. A `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` or `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` is an authored description of temporal-claim adequacy; a document, table, page, report, or card may carry that description. `supportedUse` and `unsupportedUse` state the pragmatic reach of that authored temporal-claim description. Use an evidence relation, model assumption, source-use reference, planning assumption, or named FPF pattern relation for the reason a reading is credible; do not let bare "support" do hidden ontology work.

### C.27:1 - Problem frame

#### C.27:1.1 - Causal-use boundary

`C.27` can say that a temporal claim is dynamic, intervention-sensitive, rate-sensitive, inertia-sensitive, braking-sensitive, coasting-sensitive, or rhythm-sensitive. When the temporal claim already depends on a causal-use question, `causalInterventionSpecRef`, comparator or counterfactual, estimand, assignment or intervention window, causal follow-up window, outcome measure, `causalAssumptionSetRef`, `rivalCauseSetRef`, identification strategy, counterfactual-sampling realizability claim, `CausalUseEvidenceDesignRecord`, supported causal use, or unsupported causal use, use `C.28` for the causal-use question.

What changes in practice: a sentence such as "this effort changes adoption speed" may remain a `Dyn2` temporal claim, but "this intervention causes adoption speed to improve" must also declare its `C.28` causal-use class, supported causal use, and unsupported causal use.

What this does not authorize: `C.27` does not estimate causal effects, certify counterfactual comparisons, or judge counterfactual sampling realizability; it keeps temporal claim adequacy, rate-change, effort, inertia, rhythm, braking, coasting, and intervention-sensitive temporal wording.

FPF already has established constructs and patterns for time, work, resources, measurement,
CharacteristicSpace, dynamics laws, planning, publication, and quantum-like
probe and frame issues. What is missing is a cheap claim-adequacy lens for authored
temporal claims when a state or rate reading is used as if it supplied the evidence relation, assumption relation, or pattern relation for a
rate-change, rhythm-change, regime-change, braking, coasting, redirection,
recovery, or stabilization claim.

The first-minute working situation is simple: a manager, method author,
researcher, operator, or agentic-tool planner says that something should speed
up, slow down, converge faster, recover sooner, sustain rhythm, improve
throughput, accelerate learning, brake risk, or redirect effort. FPF should
help the reader ask whether the claim is only a state reading, only a
rate or trajectory reading, or an intervention-sensitive claim about changing a
rate under effort, resistance, rhythm, feedback, constraint, or cost.

What goes wrong if missed: the text measures or names a rate and then behaves
as if it knows how to change that rate. This produces speed-only management,
benchmark theater, hidden promises, causal overclaim, effort-free acceleration,
rhythm-as-vibe, and false QL relevance.

The intended FPF gain is not "add physics metaphors". The gain is a compact
thinking-and-action discipline for cases where speed talk hides effort,
timing, resistance, evidence, scale, reversibility, and supported use.

Anti-case: if a phrase uses speed or rhythm only as ordinary explanatory prose,
or if a state or rate reading is enough for the use, C.27 should be easy not to
use.

Use C.27 because it gives a working reader a useful pause before acting
on speed talk. The intended use is not to formalize every temporal sentence.
The intended use is to stop a small set of expensive mistakes:

- a rate is measured and then treated as if the intervention mechanism is known;
- visible throughput improves while hidden queues, rework, quality loss, or
  burnout worsen;
- a past slope is treated as a future control model;
- a local rate-change is projected across scale without aggregation relation or evidence;
- rhythm or cadence is used as a vibe label with no bearer, timing reference, window,
  proxy relation, evidence relation, or supported use;
- a planning note becomes a `C.28`-governed causal-use claim, benchmark result, service promise, or
  assurance claim;
- quantum-like modeling is treated as relevant merely because the text contains discreteness,
  types, probes, tokens, or state-space wording.

The positive reader use compact is short:

1. If the statement is only a state reading, use the ordinary state relation or evidence
   relation.
2. If the statement is only a rate or trajectory reading, use measurement and
   sampling-window discipline.
3. If the statement claims that effort, policy, input, rhythm, constraint, or
   resistance changes the rate, use the least-committing C.27 record that changes supported use.
4. If the claim crosses the local working boundary into comparison, benchmark,
   publication, gate, assurance, public promise, durable rationale,
   reusable method, formal use, control use, prediction use, or cross-context transfer,
   strengthen the C.27 record and name the existing patterns that carry the
   specialist claim questions. Local decision-use can often remain a
   `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`.

This is the central anti-bureaucracy invariant: no C.27 record unless the
Dyn0, Dyn1, and Dyn2 distinction changes interpretation, decision-use, evidence relation,
resource allocation, benchmark reading, supported use, or reopen trigger.

Dyn2-Affordability: a correct C.27 use leaves less work behind than the ambiguity
would have caused. If applying C.27 creates more work than the temporal
distinction changes, stop.

At the point of use, the C.27 question is concrete. Before adding a C.27
record, recover:

- what rate, rhythm, trajectory, regime, or stability claim is in play;
- whether the text is reading state, reading rate, or claiming rate-change;
- what effort, input, policy, method, claimed intervention applier, exact assignment, or resource envelope is supposed
  to change the temporal behavior;
- what resists, delays, stores momentum, introduces lag, or makes reversal
  costly;
- what evidence, trace, assumption, model, or diagnostic judgement supplies the reason for the reading;
- what use the claim can carry and what downstream claim, effect, or use remains unsupported;
- when the simplified reading should reopen, downgrade, or cite the fuller
  applicable FPF pattern for the other question.

The pattern buys practical action, not a vocabulary test. A person can explain
the check as: "A trend is not yet an intervention model; show the effort,
window, resistance, use, and reopen condition, or keep the claim narrower."

Some useful temporal observations arrive before they can carry a claim:

- the team may not only be slow; it may be unable to brake;
- the problem may not be throughput but rhythm mismatch;
- a metric may improve while operations-service demand accumulates;
- "the process sped up" may hide orders, invoices, shipments, service tickets,
  PRs, tests, and deployments moving through different event traces and interaction
  windows;
- more tool calls may accelerate activity traces without accelerating reasoning
  or repair.

These are temporal-claim adequacy cues, not C.27 records. C.27 should preserve
their cue-only disposition. When the reader suspects a hidden Dyn2 claim question but cannot yet
state temporal reading or bearer, intervention, window, resistance or cost, evidence relation or assumption relation, and
supported use, the correct output is a partly-said material cue held through A.16, A.16.1, B.4.1, or B.5.2.0; it becomes a C.27 record only after the rate-change, rhythm-change, braking, coasting, recovery, stabilization, or intervention claim is explicit enough to name the card minimum.

If the question under repair is not temporal-claim adequacy, use the pattern that carries that question: C.16
for measurement, C.26 for residual QL cue, E.17.AUD for publication-unit stability, or
viability or assurance patterns when the observation lacks the evidence, witness,
or currentness relation needed for the viability or assurance boundary claim.

### C.27:2 - Problem

Use C.27 to check the adequacy of intervention-sensitive temporal claims.

Do not use C.27 for:

- transition laws or reusable dynamics models, which `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` carries;
- state-space or coordinate construction, which `A.19` and `C.16` carry;
- measurement construction, measurement comparability, evidence construction, provenance, assurance claim,
  or evidence decay, which `C.16`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `B.3.4`, and `G.6` carry as
  applicable;
- work actuals and resource burn, which `U.Work` and `Gamma_work` carry;
- planning structures and authorized work, which `U.WorkPlan`,
  `U.MethodDescription`, `C.24`, and relevant planning patterns carry;
- autonomy-budget declarations, guard checks, ledgers, depletion, pause or resume,
  or freedom-of-action governance, which `E.16` carries;
- state-change or evolution loops and language-state movement, which `A.4`, `B.4`,
  `A.16`, and `B.4.1` carry;
- `C.28`-governed causal-use claim, which `C.28` carries, or evaluation and evidence claim, which the relevant evaluation and evidence patterns carry;
- metric proxy and value substitution, which `E.13` carries;
- service promises, agreement text, SLA-like statements, release gates, public
  commitments, and service-acceptance bindings, which `A.2.3`, `A.2.8`,
  `A.2.9`, `A.6.C`, `F.12`, and assurance patterns carry;
- benchmark harnesses, which `G.9` carries;
- dashboard time-series, telemetry pins, path and slice publication, pack shipping,
  discipline-health slots, and refresh orchestration, which `C.21`, `G.12`,
  `G.6`, `G.10`, and `G.11` carry;
- selector-result declaration, which `G.5` carries only when a concrete
  selector result consumes a dynamic benchmark result; when that result must be available to an audience, use `E.17` for its source-backed publication face and return to source and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence and availability;
- quantum-like probe, frame, export, or coarsening residues, which `C.26` carries;
- publication roles, MVPK faces, primary EntityOfConcern values of related FPF patterns, or Kernel `U.*` kinds.

Dynamic-order labels are pattern-local claim classifications, not FPF kinds.
C.27 does not mint `U.Force`, `U.Mass`, `U.Acceleration`,
`U.Rhythm`, `U.Practice`, or `U.SecondOrderProcess`.

FPF gains a compact discipline for claims that otherwise hide behind words such
as speed, agility, throughput, adoption, rhythm, velocity, convergence,
debugging speed, service recovery, faster improvement, acceleration, braking,
redirection, or cadence.

The main failure to prevent is:

> A text measures or names a rate and then behaves as if it knows how to change
> that rate.

C.27 should make three distinctions cheap:

- `Dyn0`: state or snapshot reading;
- `Dyn1`: rate, trend, trajectory, flow, throughput, tempo, or cadence
  reading;
- `Dyn2`: intervention-sensitive temporal reading: rate-change, regime
  transition, braking, redirection, coasting, pause, stabilization, rhythm fit,
  effort profile, resistance, inertia, policy effect, feedback, uncertainty, or
  constraint handling.

C.27 protects against the managerial speed cult. Faster is
not the default value. Braking, pausing, stabilizing, redirecting, coasting,
delaying, widening before narrowing, or slowing rollout can be the correct C.27
outcome.

Local temporal-value boundary:

> C.27 can classify the temporal move. It does not decide that acceleration,
> braking, stabilization, coasting, recovery, convergence, or release speed is
> valuable. The FPF patterns for value alignment, assurance, promise, ethics,
> safety, legal, proxy, or audit concerns carry value, utility, constraint fit,
> harm, promise impact, and proxy distortion.

This boundary applies to claims such as "faster onboarding is better", "more
throughput is better", "faster convergence is better", or "rapid release is our
goal". C.27 may make the temporal claim adequate enough to inspect, but it does
not turn speed into value by default.

These are claim-relation boundary tests, not keyword exclusions. C.27 may still supply a
short temporal-claim note when the state, rate, rate-change, rhythm, or regime reading
changes supported use. The named neighbouring pattern then carries the
non-C.27 question. If the temporal distinction does not change supported use, stop before opening C.27.

Do not use C.27 when:

- the text only reports a state or snapshot and no rate or use distinction changes
  interpretation;
- the text only reports a rate, trend, throughput, cadence, or trajectory and no
  intervention-sensitive rate-change claim is made;
- a word such as speed, rhythm, acceleration, agility, or inertia is only a
  teaching metaphor or casual Plain wording;
- the issue under repair is publication-unit stability: one overloaded local head,
  drifting publication-unit primary entity of concern, bounded comparison, explanation faithfulness, or
  approval wording or action wording should use E.17.AUD, E.17.ID.CR, E.17.EFP, or the
  applicable pattern for the downstream claim, effect, or use before C.27;
- the question under repair is whether a measure is constructed, comparable, or interpretable:
  `C.16` carries measurement construction, with C.27 only citing the temporal
  C.27 relation if the measure supplies evidence for an intervention-sensitive claim;
- the question under repair is a transition law, simulation, prediction, or control model:
  `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` and formal or evidence patterns carry the formal dynamics,
  with C.27 only naming the supported-use limit of the authored claim;
- the question under repair is work actuals or resource actuals: `U.Work` and `Gamma_work` carry the
  evidence, with C.27 only using it as effort evidence or planning assumption for a Dyn2 claim;
- the question under repair is scaling-law or elasticity adequacy: C.18.1 carries scale
  variables, scale window, scale probes, and scale-elasticity value, with C.27
  only naming the temporal-claim adequacy question if scale change is used as the scale-variable relation for
  rate-change, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization;
- the question under repair is a work plan, tool-use plan, method description, or authorized
  claimed intervention applier or exact assignment: the planning pattern carries the plan, with C.27 only active
  when the plan's supported use depends on rate-change, recovery, stabilization,
  or braking;
- the question under repair is task-family specialization: C.22.1 carries adaptation
  signature fields, with C.27 only naming the temporal-claim question when
  learning or adaptation speed changes supported use;
- the question under repair is preserving a viability envelope under disturbance,
  adaptation cost, latency, operations-service demand, or boundary regulation: C.26.3 carries
  the envelope claim, with C.27 only naming the temporal move if
  braking, throttling, cadence change, recovery timing, or stabilization changes
  supported use;
- the question under repair is causal attribution: `C.28` carries causal-use claim,
  and evaluation and evidence patterns carry non-causal evaluation and evidence claims;
  C.27 may mark the temporal claim's causal use as unsupported until that `C.28`
  relation is satisfied;
- the question under repair is a benchmark, budget, promise, service boundary, SLA-like
  statement, public commitment, assurance, or release gate: the relevant
  benchmark, boundary, promise, service, assurance, or planning pattern carries
  that claim or use, with C.27 only naming the temporal claim that the other pattern
  inspects;
- the question under repair is residual quantum-like probe, frame, export, or coarsening cue:
  `C.26` carries it only after ordinary dynamics, work, measurement, benchmark,
  proxy, and assurance patterns have carried their parts.

Overlap example: "Adding review capacity for two sprints will double backlog
reduction rate and justify a budget increase" is not solved by C.27 alone. C.27
types the Dyn2 temporal-claim question; the planning pattern carries planned effort,
`C.16` carries the rate or rate-change measure, the budget or planning pattern carries
approval, and `C.28` carries any causal-use claim. The short
temporal-claim note is a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`: it prevents those
patterns from missing the hidden rate-change question, but it does not replace
them.

C.27 does not introduce:

- literal Newtonian or physical ontology for organizations, practices, services,
  dances, learning, or work cycles;
- physical quantum ontology or quantum-like superiority;
- mandatory ODE, PDE, or calculus formalism for all temporal claims;
- new U-kinds for force, mass, acceleration, rhythm, or practice;
- a new publication role, separate pattern, law sheet, or MVPK face;
- default C.27 profiling for every temporal word;
- thin C.27 echo records when a local C.27 card or profile can cite the applicable FPF pattern for the other question.

### C.27:3 - Forces

The source article contributes three practical ideas that should survive into
C.27 prose.

First, the useful question is an effort-profile question, not a derivative-word
question. In management, learning, tool-use, incident response, practice
transfer, dance, and service operations, the relevant change is often a profile
of effort over windows: impulse, scheduled push, feedback policy, adaptive
regime, brake, pause, coast, or redirect. C.27 should preserve effort over time,
not just a scalar acceleration label.

Second, rhythm is interval-structured. A rhythm claim needs a timing reference, bearer,
window, evidence proxy or observation relation, and supported use. "Rhythm" as mood
or vibe is not enough; it must be possible to recover whose rhythm, across which
intervals, by which observation or proxy, and for which decision. Coupling,
phase, synchronization, or entrainment-like wording is only needed when the
claim depends on a relation between bearers.

Third, useful formalization improves replicable practice code. C.27 should help
make a practice transferable by recording effort windows, rhythm timing references,
bearer, resistance proxy, evidence relation or assumption relation, and reopen condition. It should not require
equations merely because the source analogy used dynamics language.

Borrowed-frame translation:

| Borrowed idea | C.27 use |
| --- | --- |
| State, rate, and rate-change distinction | Adopted as Dyn0, Dyn1, and Dyn2 claim-reading discipline. |
| Effort windows, acceleration, braking, redirection, coasting, recovery, and stabilization | Adopted as the central temporal-claim adequacy question, with acceleration bias explicitly rejected. |
| Time-scale plurality: spot, episode, sprint, life-cycle time scale, learning-cycle, technoevolution, lifetime, or domain-local time scale | Adapted as an optional temporal-scale boundary declaration for boundary-crossing rhythm use, practice, learning, life-cycle time scale, or evolution claims; not mandatory for ordinary local cards. |
| Speed as result of effort, input, and resistance rather than explanation of its own future change | Adopted as the rate-as-cause-of-rate-change anti-pattern: observed speed does not by itself explain how to change speed. |
| Rhythm as interval-structured effort and rate-change pattern | Adopted with bearer, timing reference, window, evidence proxy relation, supported use, and cross-bearer coupling only when the claim depends on a named cross-bearer relation. |
| Dance and practice style as replicable temporal code | Adapted as replicable practice-description relation: if a training rhythm, review cadence, learning routine, or practice style is meant for boundary-crossing use, name what rhythm or effort pattern is transmitted, which bearer carries it, which timing reference and window make it reproducible, and what error accumulates if only static poses or rate words are transmitted. |
| Typed or discretized compact dynamic representation | A.19, C.16, and C.26 carry it only when the representation, measurement, or residual QL cue changes supported use. |
| Quantum-like or active-inference superiority claim | Not adopted in C.27; C.26 carries the residual probe, frame, order, export, or coarsening claim after ordinary C.27, C.16, work, benchmark, and proxy pattern relations are named. |
| Universal search for force and mass analogues everywhere | Rejected as literal ontology; physical words may remain Plain diagnostic cues, but C.27 mints no `U.Force`, `U.Mass`, `U.Acceleration`, `U.Rhythm`, `U.Practice`, or `U.SecondOrderProcess`. |

Design alternatives:

| Design alternative | C.27 outcome | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Do nothing | Insufficient | Leaves FPF vulnerable to speed-only, rate-only, rhythm-as-vibe, and effort-free intervention claims. |
| Add examples only | Insufficient | Examples would not create a reusable adequacy lens or pattern-relation discipline. |
| Put the whole question in `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` | Wrong primary EntityOfConcern | `U.Dynamics` carries a transition law or model, not the cross-pattern recognition and escalation lens. |
| Put the whole question in `C.16` | Wrong primary EntityOfConcern | Measurement construction is necessary, but it does not cover effort windows, planning, inertia proxies, promises, or intervention adequacy. |
| Put the whole question in `C.24` | Too narrow | Agentic tool-use is one application, not the general pattern for temporal claim adequacy. |
| Put the whole question in `C.26` | Wrong residual QL relation | This would make quantum-like modeling relevant too early; C.26 remains residual for probe, frame, export, or coarsening cues. |
| Add new U-kinds such as `U.Force`, `U.Mass`, `U.Acceleration`, `U.Rhythm`, `U.Practice`, or `U.SecondOrderProcess` | Wrong ontology | The repeated value is a claim-adequacy lens, not a stable Kernel ontology. |
| Create a new publication role or separate pattern for C.27 cards | Wrong EntityOfConcern kind | Dyn2 temporal-claim records are pattern-local records, not publication roles or separate patterns. |
| Use C.27 and cite the FPF patterns for the other questions | Chosen C.27 shape | C.27 carries the adequacy lens while measurement, dynamics-law, work, benchmark, promise, quality, viability, and QL relations stay in the applicable patterns. |
| Duplicate C.27 claim-adequacy content across every related pattern | Too broad | Broad distribution would make ordinary temporal wording expensive. A C.27 card or profile cites the applicable FPF pattern for the other question instead of creating a duplicate temporal record. |

### C.27:4 - Solution

Use the least-committing dynamic-order output that changes the supported use. Dyn0 and Dyn1 are readings in ordinary prose, not C.27 record classes; C.27 records start only when a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` or `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` for boundary-crossing claim use is needed.

| Level | User-visible move | Stop condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Skip** | Leave as ordinary prose | temporal wording does not change claim or use |
| **Dyn0 reading** | state reading or snapshot only | snapshot is enough |
| **Dyn1 reading** | rate, trend, or trajectory only, or C.16-compatible measure when FPF-governed | no intervention-sensitive claim |
| **Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard** | one-screen `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` | local plan, diagnostic, rhythm, effort, or intervention clarity is enough |
| **Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile** | `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` with active profile blocks only | the authored temporal claim is used beyond the local working context, is published, benchmarked, promised, assured, made durable rationale, repeated in a reusable method description, used in a gate, public dashboard, or Part G pack, or carried across context or scale |
| **Formal-model relation** | C.27 states the temporal-claim question and cites the pattern that carries the formal claim | reusable law, simulation, prediction, control, calibrated model, or assurance-facing comparison is claimed |

A Dyn2 classification is not evidence that a `U.Dynamics` model exists. It is
only evidence that the authored claim is using temporal change in a way that may
need a dynamics pattern relation if a downstream claim, effect, or use is claimed.

Normativity follows boundary-crossing use:

- normative when the claim carries decision, gate, budget, benchmark,
  publication, assurance, public promise, or reusable method;
- advisory when the claim is exploratory, abductive, or early planning;
- informative when the pattern teaches examples, vocabulary, or anti-patterns.

This is the ordinary first-minute reader-facing form and the main visible C.27 record
for ordinary C.27 use. It remains referenced to an authored claim rather than
becoming a free-standing consulting card.

```text
Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard

claimTextOrClaimRef:
  What sentence, claim, plan line, benchmark line, or promise-like wording is being read?

temporalReadingOrBearer:
  What rate, rhythm, regime, recovery, trajectory, stability reading, or temporal-aspect bearer is being used for a practical claim?

move:
  accelerate | decelerate | brake | redirect | coast | pause |
  stabilize | recover | sustain | widen | narrow | domain-local

intervention:
  What effort, input, policy, method, resource, tool-use change, or action is supposed to change it?

window:
  Over what claim, sampling, effort, rhythm, or validity window?

resistanceOrCost:
  What resists, delays, stores momentum, creates residue, or makes the change costly?

evidenceTraceModelOrAssumption:
  What evidence relation, trace, measurement, work evidence, model assumption,
  planning assumption, diagnostic judgement, or named neighbouring-pattern
  reference is being used for this temporal-claim reading?

supportedUse:
  What decision, plan, diagnosis, comparison, or pattern relation can this record carry?

unsupportedUseOrReopen:
  What downstream claim, effect, or use is unsupported, and what would reopen, downgrade, or add a pattern reference to this claim?
```

Window default: for a local card, one `window` line may stand for claim, sampling,
effort, rhythm, and validity when the distinction does not change supported use.
Split windows only when evidence is sampled over a different interval than the
claim, effort or intervention occurs over a different interval than the outcome,
benchmark baseline, adaptation, and follow-up windows differ, the rhythm timing reference and rhythm window
differs from the measurement window, or validity or refresh depends on a separate
freshness window.

Do not add compact catch-all reason or state fields to a local card. If boundary-crossing use appears, name the actual evidence relation, evidence record, trace, measurement relation, model assumption, planning assumption, benchmark reference, `C.28` causal-use relation, promise pattern, or assurance pattern that carries the added claim. That named neighbour relation helps choose the matching `dynClaimUseClass`; the local card itself does not strengthen the claim.

`claimText` and `claimRef` keep C.27 tethered to the `PublicationUnit` or selected claim-bearing `U.Episteme` that carries the temporal claim; when current availability matters, name the exact `EpistemePublicationRelation` occurrence reference separately. `temporalReadingOrBearer` separates the bearer and the temporal reading from the intervention, so "we accelerate the team" gets repaired into a rate, rhythm, or trajectory question. `move` protects against
acceleration bias: braking, pausing, stabilization, recovery, coasting,
widening, and narrowing are also Dyn2 moves when they change supported use.

If the author cannot answer these in short lines, the correct repair is usually
to clarify the claim, not to escalate immediately to a full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`.

Compact C.27 rhythm-claim discipline:

```text
dyn2RhythmClaimBlock? or Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard fields:
  rhythmBearerRef : whose or what rhythm?
  rhythmTimingReference : beat | cadence | cycle | sprint | epoch | release train | attention window | domain-local timing reference
  rhythmWindowRef : over what interval?
  instrumentProxyOrEvidenceRef? : trace | proxy | observation | measurement reference
  supportedUse : what decision or reading this record can carry
  couplingMode? : only when cross-bearer synchronization, phase relation, dependency, coordination, or entrainment-like practice relation is claimed
  validityWindowRef? : only when the rhythm reading is used beyond the immediate working window
```

Cadence as observed interval rate may be Dyn1. Rhythm becomes Dyn2 only when
interval structure, effort pattern, coordination, recovery, stabilization, or
intervention-sensitive use changes supported use.

This discipline keeps rhythm connected to a dynamic claim. A plain "release cadence" or "workshop rhythm" does not need phase or entrainment language unless the supported use depends on a relation between bearers. If the rhythm wording does not change a rate, intervention, recovery, coordination, or supported-use reading, it should remain ordinary prose rather than make C.27 relevant.

Compact C.27 coasting-claim discipline:

```text
dyn2CoastingClaimBlock? or Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard fields:
  coastingClaim : movement, stability, adoption, quality change, queue drain, operations-service demand, or practice persistence continues after effort changes or stops
  coastingBasis : habit | automation | stored work | queue pressure | learned capability | commitment momentum | social norm | physical inertia | unknown
  coastingWindowRef : over what interval after effort changes or stops?
  supportedUse : what decision, plan, diagnosis, comparison, or local practice reading this record can carry
  unsupportedUse : what downstream claim, effect, or use this coasting reading cannot carry
  reopenTrigger : what change, decay, stall, reversal, hidden cost, or new evidence reopens the claim
```

Coasting becomes a full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` block only when a promise,
gate, assurance, benchmark, cross-scale transfer, or public comparison depends
on continued movement or stability after effort changes or stops. Local cases
such as adoption continuing after incentives stop, quality degrading after
acceleration stops, operations-service demand continuing after rollout, a trained practice
persisting after training, or a queue draining after intervention ends usually
need only the card fields above.

Coasting and debt fork:

- Use `dyn2CoastingClaimBlock?` when supported use depends on continued
  movement, stability, adoption, queue drain, practice persistence, or
  operations-service demand after effort changes or stops.
- Use `dyn2DebtHysteresisBlock?` when supported use depends on residue,
  reversibility, hidden cost, delayed damage, repayment, braking, or recovery
  plan.
- If both relations apply, coasting describes continued motion or stability; debt and
  hysteresis describe what remains and how costly reversal or recovery is.

#### C.27:4.R - Rare boundary-crossing profile reference

Skip this reference subsection for ordinary local diagnosis and planning. The first C.27 output remains the one-screen `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; open the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` reference only when the authored temporal claim is used beyond the local working context.

Use the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` only for authored temporal claims used beyond the local working context. It is a pattern-local authored temporal-claim adequacy record, not a model of the dynamic system itself, not a publication role, not a Part G record, not an MVPK face, and not the default C.27 record.

Read the profile-block menu only when boundary-crossing use is being made. The list below is a pattern-relation menu, not a form. The absence of an inactive block is normal; it is not a missing field.

The shape is a header plus present profile blocks. The header carries the minimum boundary-crossing claim-use classification. Each block should be read from its applicability sentence first, and a block appears only when `supportedUse` relies on that claim relation. These blocks are not fields of one universal dynamic EntityOfConcern; they are different evidence descriptions and pattern relations made relevant by supported use.

Profile-block closure rule: every present block is either defined by C.27,
a pattern-reference-only block that cites the existing FPF pattern carrying the
other question and adds no new C.27 EntityOfConcern, or absent from `activeBlocks`.
A block name is not a new EntityOfConcern.

Active-block naming rule: read each `activeBlocks` name by one of three statuses.
`localAdequacyBlock` means C.27 states local adequacy fields for an authored
temporal claim. `patternReferenceOnly` means C.27 states only the temporal
move, window, and supported-use boundary and cites the FPF pattern that carries the
other question. `relationOnly` means the concern appears in relations or
examples but not as an active block. `dyn2PromiseBoundaryRelation?`,
`dyn2HighStakesTemporalActionRelation?`, and `dyn2PolicyTransferRelation?` are
pattern-reference-only by default; `dyn2PolicyTransferRelation?` is folded into
`dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` when behavior-policy and evaluation-policy transfer is
FPF-governed.

    dyn2QLResidualRelation? // if residual probe, frame, order, export, or coarsening cue remains after ordinary FPF pattern relations
}
```

Absence of an inactive block is normal. It is not a missing field. A block
becomes active only when the supported use relies on it; otherwise the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`
should stay smaller or downgrade to a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, Dyn1 reading, or ordinary prose.

Pattern-reference-only blocks:

- `dyn2PolicyTransferRelation?` is handled inside `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` when
  behavior-policy and evaluation-policy transfer or off-policy transfer is FPF-governed. C.27
  names `behaviorPolicyRef`, `proposedPolicyRef`, `offPolicyRisk`, and the
  evaluation or control pattern relation; it does not create a separate policy-transfer
  pattern.
- `dyn2PromiseBoundaryRelation?` states only the temporal action, window,
  supported use, unsupported downstream claim, effect, or use, and references to the patterns that
  carry promise, commitment, instituting speech act, service acceptance,
  contract unpacking, and assurance: `A.2.3`, `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, `A.6.C`,
  `F.12`, and assurance patterns.
- `dyn2HighStakesTemporalActionRelation?` states only the high-stakes temporal action, window,
  unsupported downstream claim, effect, or use, and reference to the pattern that carries the harm,
  quality, safety, ethics, legal, financial, operations-service, or
  human-wellbeing question.

Header discipline: for a `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` for boundary-crossing claim use, `claimRef`,
`entityOfConcernRef`, `dynClaimUseClass`, `dynOrder`, `claimWindowRef`,
`supportedUse`, `unsupportedUse`, and `reopenTrigger` are mandatory.
`temporalBearerRef` is present when the temporal bearer differs from the
EntityOfConcern or is otherwise FPF-governed. `profileCarrierRef` is present
when publication or evidence needs the authored carrier named. `baseCharacteristicRef`
is mandatory only when measurement, comparison, or C.16 relation is FPF-governed; for a Plain diagnostic claim it may remain a local phrase in the `temporalReadingOrBearer` line.

Window split rule: one local window is enough only when the claim window,
sampling window, effort or intervention window, validity window, baseline window,
and follow-up window are the same for the supported use. Split them when the
evidence is sampled over a different interval than the claim, effort is applied
before or after the measured change, a comparison needs a baseline, an outcome is
observed after exposure, or the claim remains valid only for a shorter period
than the historical trace. If the split is unknown and the supported use depends
on it, downgrade the use or add the relevant window reference before relying on
the temporal claim.

C.16 rate-measurement relation: when rate or rate-change is FPF-governed, C.27
cites the C.16 measurement relation. C.27 does not define measurement
legality.

```text
c16RateMeasurementRelationRef? {
  baseCharacteristicRef
  stateMeasureRef?
  rateMeasureRef?
  rateChangeReadingMeasureRef?
  DHCMethodRef?
  samplingWindowRef
  scaleUnitPolarityRef?
  evidenceStubRefs?
  stabilityOrNoiseEvidenceOrAssumption?
  C16MeasurementRelationRef
}
```

C.27 effort and work block: when a rate-change claim depends on effort, resources, a method, a claimed intervention applier, an assignment, or performer eligibility, C.27 keeps the plan, method description, resource envelope, actual Work trace, applier record, authority, proposed WorkPlan, hypothetical-use note, and capability claim separate. It does not turn an assignment into an actor or work evidence into a dynamics law.

```text
dyn2EffortWorkBlock? {
  causalInterventionSpecRef?
  plannedEffortRef?        // WorkPlan, MethodDescription, or resource envelope
  actualEffortTraceRef?    // U.Work or Gamma_work evidence
  effortWindowRef?
  claimedInterventionApplier? {
    branch: systemActor | assignmentReferencedActor | otherClaimedApplier
    systemActorRef?: U.EntityRef constrained to U.System
    assignmentReferencedActor?: {
      actorSystemRef: U.EntityRef constrained to U.System
      actorSystemRoleAssignmentRef: U.RelationRef constrained to U.SystemRoleAssignment
    }
    otherClaimedApplier?: {
      applierRef: value typed by applierRefKind
      applierRefKind: one existing RefKind admitted for the recovered kind
      recoveredKindRef: U.KindRef
      subjectPatternLocator: PatternID
    }
    authorityRelationRef?
    proposedWorkPlanRef?
    hypotheticalUseNote?
    actorCapabilityRef?
  }
  resourceEnvelopeRef?
  A15WorkRelationRef?
}
```

Exactly one applier branch is selected. `systemActor` names an admitted system directly. `assignmentReferencedActor` still names the actual holder system as the actor and cites the exact assignment separately; the assignment neither acts nor supplies authority. `otherClaimedApplier` first recovers the object's kind and subject pattern, then uses an existing RefKind; if none exists, the referent remains unresolved instead of minting an actor or applier union kind here. Authority, a WorkPlan, hypothetical use, capability, performed Work, and intervention effect remain separately governed. The record reports what is claimed to apply the intervention; any stronger claim uses its direct relation or returns the exact missing governor.

C.27 resistance and inertia block: `dyn2ResistanceInertiaBlock?` is present when supported use depends on what resists, delays, stores momentum, creates residue, or makes the change costly. This is core C.27 content because it prevents effort-free acceleration claims. The `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` asks the question locally; the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` uses a separate active profile block only when that answer matters beyond the local working context.

```text
dyn2ResistanceInertiaBlock? {
  resistanceOrInertiaProxy
  resistanceProxyFamily
  resistanceProxyEvidenceOrAssumption:
    qualitativeJudgement | measurementRef | modelAssumptionRef |
    planningAssumption | unknown
  evidenceRef?
  unsupportedUse?
}
```

`resistanceProxyEvidenceOrAssumption = unknown` is an acceptable C.27 result. Unknown resistance need not
block a local diagnostic `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, but it should block durable
acceleration, causal, benchmark, promise-like, or assurance use until the relevant evidence relation, measurement relation, model assumption, or carrying pattern reference is supplied.

C.27 control or policy relation: `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` is present only when `dynClaimUseClass` is `controlModel`, `policyRule`, `adaptive`, a `planningModel` with feedback relation, or an explicit C.24, C.19, or evaluation relation. This relation says that the authored temporal claim has crossed into control model, policy model, or policy-evaluation use. It does not make C.27 an MPC, reinforcement-learning, or policy-evaluation pattern.

```text
dyn2ControlPolicyRelation? {
  interventionRegime
  controlHorizon?
  closedLoopUpdate?
  behaviorPolicyRef?
  proposedPolicyRef?
  offPolicyRisk?
  stopRule?
  controlPolicyRelationRef -> U.Dynamics, C.19, C.24, or evaluation pattern
}
```

C.27 causal-use relation: `dyn2CausalUseRelation?` is present only when the authored temporal claim uses a rate-change, intervention, effort, workshop, policy, or practice change to make a causal-use claim. Core rule: C.27 can say a claim is Dyn2 and intervention-sensitive; C.27 cannot turn that rate-change or intervention relation into a `C.28`-governed causal-use claim. The fields below are `C.28` refs consumed by C.27, not `C.27`-defined causal aliases.

```text
dyn2CausalUseRelation? {
  causalInterventionSpecRef
  comparatorOrCounterfactualRef
  timeZeroOrAssignmentWindow
  followUpWindowRef
  outcomeMeasureRef
  estimandRef?
  causalAssumptionSetRef?
  rivalCauseSetRef?
  causalIdentificationProfileRef?
  causalUseEvidenceDesignRef?
  offPolicyCausalEvaluationProfileRef?
  supportedCausalUse
  unsupportedCausalUse
}
```

C.27 dynamic benchmark requirement: `dyn2BenchmarkParityBlock?` is present only when a comparison or benchmark depends on rate, rate-change, recovery speed, rhythm improvement, intervention effect, effort budget, or dynamic outcome. Content rule: C.27 declares the dynamic claim question of the benchmark; `G.9` carries parity.

```text
dyn2BenchmarkParityBlock? {
  comparedClaimRefs
  dynOrderCompared: Dyn1 | Dyn2
  baselineWindowRef
  adaptationOrInterventionWindowRef?
  budgetOrEffortParityRef?
  rateOrRateChangeReadingMeasureRef?
  G9ParityPlanRef
  G9ParityReportRef?
}
```

C.27 metric-target effect block: `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` is present only
when metric publication, target use, incentive use, dashboard use, gate use, or
public comparison changes temporal behavior or supported use. C.16 carries the
measure; E.13, assurance, or governance patterns carry proxy distortion and utility distortion;
C.26 is relevant only if residual probe, frame, order, or export cue remains.

```text
dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock? {
  publishedOrTargetedMeasureRef
  targetOrIncentiveUse
  dashboardGatePromiseOrBudgetUse?
  behaviorChangeRisk
  temporalWorkChangeVsMeasurementChangeNote
  C16MeasurementRelationRef?
  E13ProxyAuditRef?
  C26ResidualQLRelationRef? // only if residual probe, frame, order, or export cue remains
}
```

C.27 object-centric trace block: `dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?` is present only
when a work-cycle or process-rate claim depends on several object bearers, event
traces, interactions, or aggregation relation rather than one scalar speed label.
C.27 records why scalar throughput is insufficient; object-centric process
mining or local process evidence carries the detailed log discipline.

```text
dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock? {
  bearerKind: single-object | multi-object | aggregate | proxy
  objectTypeRefs
  eventTraceRef
  interactionOrCouplingNote?
  convergenceDivergenceRisk?
  aggregationRelation?
  supportedUse
  unsupportedUse
}
```

C.27 cross-scale transfer field: `dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?` is present only when a dynamic claim transfers rate, rate-change, rhythm, recovery, acceleration, braking, or agility from one bearer, holon level, or aggregate to another. Aggregate rate-change and local rate-change are different readings unless aggregation relation and bearer continuity are declared.

```text
dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock? {
  sourceBearerRef
  targetBearerRef
  aggregationRelation?
  mixShiftRisk?
  crossScaleTransferUseBoundary
}
```

C.27 scale-variable claim block: `dyn2ScaleVariableClaimBlock?` is present only when the
authored temporal claim says that changing a resource or scale variable changes
rate, improvement, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization. This is
not the same as cross-scale transfer: scale-variable claim asks which variable is
changed and over what scale window; cross-scale transfer asks whether a dynamic
reading is carried across bearer, holon level, or aggregate. C.18.1 carries scale
variables, scale windows, scale probes, and scale-elasticity value; C.27 records
only that the scale change is being used to make a temporal-claim reading.

```text
dyn2ScaleVariableClaimBlock? {
  scaleVariableRef
  scaleWindowRef?
  scaleElasticityValue: rising | knee | flat | declining | unknown
  C18_1ScaleRelationRef?
  G9ParityPlanRef?
}
```

C.27 task-family adaptation relation: `dyn2TaskFamilyAdaptationRelation?` is present
only when the temporal claim says that a holder, dyad, team, specialist
portfolio, method, or agent reaches usable specialization faster on one declared
`TaskFamilyRef` or `TaskSignature`. C.22.1 carries the task-family adaptation
signature. C.27 records only the learning-rate or adaptation-rate question and the
supported use that made it relevant.

```text
dyn2TaskFamilyAdaptationRelation? {
  TaskFamilyRef?
  TaskSignature?
  thresholdOrUsableSpecializationRef?
  timeToThresholdRef?
  budgetToThresholdRef?
  C22_1TaskFamilyAdaptationRelationRef
}
```

C.27 viability-envelope relation: `dyn2ViabilityEnvelopeRelation?` is present only when
a temporal claim says braking, slowing rollout, throttling, cadence change,
recovery timing, adaptation cost, operations-service demand, or stabilization keeps a
viability bearer inside usable bounds. C.27 may type the temporal move and its
window. C.26.3 carries the viability-envelope claim: protected promise or
function, viable bounds, disturbance, sensor split, probe split, action split, adaptation
cost, and failure mode. Do not make C.27 the pattern for all "stability through
change" claims.

```text
dyn2ViabilityEnvelopeRelation? {
  viabilityBearerRef?
  protectedPromiseOrFunctionRef?
  temporalActionRef?
  C26_3ViabilityEnvelopeRelationRef
}
```

C.27 residual QL relation: `dyn2QLResidualRelation?` is present only when ordinary FPF
patterns have already carried the temporal-claim, measurement, work, benchmark,
value-proxy, scale, adaptation, viability, promise, or evidence relation and a
residual probe, frame, order, export, or coarsening cue still changes the supported
reading. C.26 carries the residual QL reading. C.27 only records that the authored
temporal claim has a residual QL relation; this block stays hidden by default when
no such residue exists.

```text
dyn2QLResidualRelation? {
  residualQLCue?
  residualQLRelationRef?
  ordinaryPatternRelationRef?
  C26ResidualQLRelationRef
}
```

C.27 debt and hysteresis block: `dyn2DebtHysteresisBlock?` is present only when supported use depends on sustained acceleration, braking, recovery, stabilization, domain residue after effort changes, or a public promise, gate, assurance, or high-stakes decision about rate-change. Unknown reversibility is allowed, but it bounds supported use.

```text
dyn2DebtHysteresisBlock? {
  debtKind?
  debtWindowRef?
  evidenceRef?
  reversibilityClaim: reversible | costlyToReverse | irreversibleWithinWindow | unknown
  hysteresisOrResidue?
  repaymentOrBrakePlan?
  debtHysteresisRelationRef -> planning, assurance, quality, wellbeing, or safety pattern
}
```

These C.27 dynamic-claim profile-block field definitions are boundary-crossing
material for `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` and for higher-stakes authored temporal
claims used beyond the local working context. They are not the default C.27 user
interface, not a data model, and not a universal C.27 dynamic-claim field list
that every user must fill.

C.27 uses physical words only as Plain analogies. Tech prose uses effort,
input, and work references rather than force; resistance and inertia proxies rather
than mass; rate-change readings rather than acceleration as a new kind; and
rhythm bearer, timing reference, and rhythm window rather than `U.Rhythm`.

Each field definition either carries a small local C.27 temporal-claim adequacy value or points
back to the applicable FPF pattern for the referenced EntityOfConcern or relation. A field name
is not a pattern.
Metric, process, service, practice, policy, harm, operations-service, and envelope wording
does not create a free C.27 slot. It must resolve to a local C.27 value, an
existing FPF kind and reference, or a reference to the applicable FPF pattern; otherwise it remains
Plain example language.

| Field or question | Definition | Kind discipline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| claimTextOrClaimRef | The sentence, claim, plan line, benchmark line, or promise-like wording being read. | References C.27 to an authored claim or source; not a free-standing consulting card. |
| temporalReadingOrBearer | The temporal reading or temporal-aspect bearer whose adequacy is in question: rate, cadence, flow, convergence, recovery, narrowing, widening, stabilization, regime, or trajectory. | Local description plus `baseCharacteristicRef` or measurement relation when FPF-governed. |
| move | The temporal move: accelerate, decelerate, brake, redirect, coast, pause, stabilize, recover, sustain, widen, narrow, or domain-local. | Prevents acceleration-only bias; braking, pausing, recovery, and coasting can be positive Dyn2 moves. |
| effort, input, policy, method, or intervention | The planned or claimed source of rate-change. It may be work, method change, policy rule, resource input, tool-use change, or control action. | References planning, work, method, policy, or control patterns; it is not stored as a new force object. |
| window | The time interval over which the claim is made, effort is applied, rate is sampled, rhythm is observed, or validity is asserted. | Use a time reference or window reference appropriate to the pattern; do not collapse all windows into `U.Dynamics.timeBase`. |
| resistance, delay, momentum, or cost | The reason rate-change is not free or immediate: constraint, lag, habit, queue pressure, coordination cost, technical debt, operations-service demand, friction, or domain-local resistance proxy. | Domain-local proxy, not literal mass; evidence or assumption should be named when the authored temporal claim is used beyond the local working context. |
| evidence, trace, model, assumption, or diagnostic judgement | The evidence relation, evidence record, trace, measurement, work evidence, model assumption, planning assumption, diagnostic judgement, or named neighbouring-pattern reference being used for this temporal-claim reading. | Cites C.16, work and evidence, causal, benchmark, promise, or assurance patterns when a downstream claim, effect, or use is claimed; do not compress these into one generic field. |
| supported decision or use | The practical use that this `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` can carry: orientation, plan choice, budget, benchmark, gate, replan, publication, or local diagnosis. | Must stay within the named evidence relation, model assumption, planning assumption, or neighbouring-pattern relation, and `dynClaimUseClass`. |
| unsupported downstream claim, effect, or use | A nearby use that this `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` cannot carry, such as `C.28`-governed causal-use claim, release approval, public promise, cross-context transfer, benchmark superiority, or service guarantee. | Prevents laundering a light `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` into a heavier temporal-claim record. |
| reopen, downgrade, or pattern-reference condition | A condition that requires revisiting the `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, downgrading to Dyn0 or Dyn1, escalating to a profile or formal pattern, or citing another pattern. | This is an evolvability trigger, not a state label. |
| rhythmBearerRef | The entity, practice, work cycle, service, learner, body part, system component, or other named bearer whose rhythm is described. | Must resolve to a named FPF kind and reference or explicitly remain Plain example language; C.27 does not mint a new rhythm kind. |
| rhythmTimingReference | The temporal reference for a rhythm claim: beat, cadence, cycle, sprint, epoch, release train, attention window, or domain-local timing reference. | It is a timing reference for interpretation, not `U.Rhythm`. |
| rhythmWindowRef | The time window across which rhythm is asserted or measured. | Separate from claim, sampling, effort, and validity windows when they differ. |
| instrumentProxyOrEvidenceRef | The measurement or observation proxy used for rhythm, such as tapping task, cadence log, work trace, event sequence, survey, sensor, or domain evidence reference. | Uses C.16 and evidence discipline when FPF-governed. |
| couplingMode | How rhythm in one bearer or signal is related to another: synchronization, phase relation, dependency, coordination, entrainment-like practice relation, or domain-local coupling. | Active only when cross-bearer relation is claimed; otherwise ordinary cadence does not need coupling language. |
| validityWindowRef | The period or condition under which the rhythm reading is valid. | Prevents stale rhythm claims from boundary-crossing indefinitely. |

`dynClaimUseClass` discipline: in `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`, `dynClaimUseClass` is a
pattern-relation declaration, not a maturity scale. A `diagnosticReading` does not mature
into a `causalClaim` by adding fields; `C.28` carries causal-use
questions and records. A `planningModel` does not become `promiseBoundaryUse` by
publication; promise, boundary, commitment, service, or assurance patterns carry
promise-like claim use. Changing `dynClaimUseClass` may change the applicable pattern relation,
evidence relation, model assumption, planning assumption, or assurance-facing relation.
No C.27 field completion upgrades `dynClaimUseClass`; a higher-stakes `dynClaimUseClass` is a
relation change.

| Field | Definition | Kind discipline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| claimRef | The authored claim, sentence, plan line, benchmark line, or promise-like wording that the profile for boundary-crossing claim use describes. | Mandatory; references the profile to authored temporal-claim content. |
| entityOfConcernRef | The entity, work occurrence, system, practice, service, method, or other EntityOfConcern whose temporal claim is being described. | Reference to the EntityOfConcern through its named FPF kind and reference; not the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` itself. |
| temporalBearerRef | The bearer that has the rate, rhythm, regime, trajectory, or rate-change. It may differ from the EntityOfConcern in aggregate or proxy cases. | Use only when bearer distinction matters; avoid loose `carrierOrSubject`. |
| profileCarrierRef | The document, card, profile, report, benchmark record, or other authored carrier that contains the Dyn2 claim record. | Carrier of the description, not the dynamic system. |
| dynClaimUseClass | The pattern-local claim-use class of the dynamic temporal claim: assumption, conjecture, observed trace, diagnostic reading, planning model, control model, calibrated model, causal claim, benchmark claim, assurance claim, or promise-like claim. This is not a maturity sequence: a causal claim requires different evidence and pattern relations from a diagnostic reading, and a promise-like claim requires different relations from a benchmark. Changing `dynClaimUseClass` may change the applicable pattern relation, evidence relation, model assumption, planning assumption, or assurance pattern. | Reading a dynamic temporal claim as carrying a different `dynClaimUseClass` is a relation change; use the applicable FPF pattern for the downstream claim, effect, or use. |
| dynOrder | Pattern-local classification: `Dyn0`, `Dyn1`, or `Dyn2`. | Classification of a claim, not a Kernel kind. |
| baseCharacteristicRef | The characteristic whose state, rate, or rate-change is being discussed. | Mandatory only when measurement, comparison, or C.16 relation is FPF-governed; otherwise the `temporalReadingOrBearer` line may carry a local Plain phrase. |
| stateMeasureRef | Measurement reference for a state reading or snapshot. | C.16-compatible when used as evidence or comparison. |
| rateMeasureRef | Measurement reference for rate, tempo, throughput, cadence, flow, trend, or trajectory. | C.16-compatible and separate from state measure when FPF-governed. |
| rateChangeReadingMeasureRef | Measurement reference used as evidence for an acceleration, deceleration, braking, redirection, stabilization, hazard-change, queue-pressure-change, or other rate-change reading. | C.16-compatible; this is evidence for a reading, not a new primitive acceleration measure. |
| publishedOrTargetedMeasureRef | The measure being used as reading, dashboard signal, target, gate, incentive, budget input, or public comparison. | C.16 carries measurement construction and comparability; target use or proxy use belongs outside C.27 when FPF-governed. |
| targetOrIncentiveUse | How the metric is used as a target, incentive, optimization proxy, management signal, or behavior-shaping prompt. | E.13, assurance, or governance patterns carry proxy distortion and utility distortion. |
| dashboardGatePromiseOrBudgetUse | Whether the metric appears in a dashboard, gate, promise, budget, review, or public comparison. | Names boundary or assurance pattern relations when those uses are being made. |
| behaviorChangeRisk | How publication, target pressure, incentive, or gate use may change behavior. | C.27 records temporal intervention risk; causal-use claim still needs `C.28` causal-use relation. |
| temporalWorkChangeVsMeasurementChangeNote | Split between real work-rate or process-rate change, measurement effect or probe effect, gaming effect or selection effect, and causal effect if claimed. | Prevents metric improvement from being read as system improvement. |
| C16MeasurementRelationRef | Cited pattern relation for measurement construction, comparability, and evidence. | C.27 cites it; C.27 does not define metric construction or comparability. |
| E13ProxyAuditRef | Cited pattern relation for proxy-metric distortion, pragmatic utility, or value-proxy divergence. | Keeps metric-as-target work out of C.27 when the dynamic temporal claim is not being made. |
| C26ResidualQLRelationRef | Reference for residual probe, frame, order, export, or coarsening cue. | Only present after ordinary C.27, C.16, and E.13 pattern relations leave a residual quantum-like cue. |
| residualQLCue | The cue that a remaining probe, frame, order, export, coarsening, or similar representational condition may change the supported reading after ordinary FPF patterns have carried their parts. | Plain cue; vocabulary alone does not make QL relevant. |
| residualQLRelationRef | The specific residual QL cue, if any, that still matters to supported use after ordinary temporal, measurement, work, benchmark, value-proxy, scale, adaptation, viability, promise, or evidence pattern relations are named. | C.26 carries the QL discipline; C.27 only records the pattern-reference need. |
| ordinaryPatternRelationRef | Reference showing which ordinary FPF pattern relation already carries the non-QL relation. | Prevents QL from stealing measurement, work, value, benchmark, scale, adaptation, viability, or promise work. |
| DHCMethodRef | Reference to the declared method for constructing or interpreting the characteristic or measure. | Existing C.16 relation; not a new measurement primitive. |
| scaleVariableRef | The resource or scale variable whose change is claimed to change rate, improvement, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization: review capacity, tool-call budget, token budget, sprint count, data volume, model capacity, parallelism, freedom of action, or domain-local scale variable. | Resolves through `C.18.1` or through the named FPF kind and reference that carries the resource or scale variable; not a new force or effort kind. |
| scaleWindowRef | The scale range or window over which the scale-variable claim is asserted. | C.18.1 carries scale-window discipline; G.9 carries parity when compared. |
| scaleElasticityValue | Qualitative C.18.1 value for the scale claim: rising, knee, flat, declining, or unknown. | Not a numeric scaling law and not proof that more scale is better; C.18.1 carries the scale-variable claim. |
| C18_1ScaleRelationRef | Cited pattern relation for C.18.1 scaling-law lens adequacy when a scale-variable or elasticity claim is being made. | C.27 cites it; C.27 does not define scaling-law discipline. |
| TaskFamilyRef | The declared task family whose time-to-usable-specialization or adaptation speed is being discussed. | C.22.1 carries the task-family adaptation signature; C.27 only states the temporal-claim question. |
| TaskSignature | The declared task signature or specialization signature used by C.22.1. | Not a C.27 kind; used only to prevent generic learning-speed talk. |
| thresholdOrUsableSpecializationRef | The threshold, criterion, or usable-specialization target that makes "adapted faster" inspectable. | Keeps adaptation-speed claims from becoming vague improvement claims. |
| timeToThresholdRef | The time window or time-to-threshold reference for reaching the declared adaptation target. | C.27 may type the temporal-claim question; C.22.1 carries adaptation-signature meaning. |
| budgetToThresholdRef | The effort, resource, exposure, or budget reference needed to reach the declared adaptation target. | Use C.22.1 and work or resource patterns for FPF-governed budget or exposure detail. |
| C22_1TaskFamilyAdaptationRelationRef | Cited pattern relation for C.22.1 task-family adaptation signature reference. | Mandatory when `dyn2TaskFamilyAdaptationRelation?` is active. |
| viabilityBearerRef | The System, admitted collective System, delivery System, organism-as-System, service situation, or other declared bearer whose viability is being discussed. | C.26.3 carries viability-envelope discipline; C.27 only names the temporal move when that move changes supported use. If source wording says “role configuration,” use `E.10.ROLE` and recover the local system-role kinds, classifications, assignments, their configuration relation, or another structure established by its direct pattern before use; that configuration does not become the viability bearer by wording alone. |
| protectedPromiseOrFunctionRef | The promise, function, or operating regime that the viability envelope is meant to preserve. | Uses C.26.3 and promise, boundary, or service patterns when FPF-governed. |
| C26_3ViabilityEnvelopeRelationRef | Cited pattern relation for C.26.3 viability-envelope boundary regulation when temporal change is used to preserve viable bounds. | Mandatory when `dyn2ViabilityEnvelopeRelation?` is active; C.27 does not define viability envelopes. |
| timeBase | Time base of an underlying dynamics model, if a model is being used. | Do not use it as a catch-all for every claim, sampling, effort, or rhythm window. |
| claimWindowRef | The time window over which the Dyn2 claim is asserted. | Separate from evidence and effort windows when needed. |
| samplingWindowRef | The time window over which state, rate, or rate-change evidence is sampled. | Required for noisy derivative-like readings used in claims requiring additional evidence. |
| effortWindowRef | The time window over which planned or actual effort or input is applied. | Applies planning and work patterns. |
| rhythmWindowRef | The window over which rhythm, cadence, or phase relation is asserted. | Uses bearer, timing-reference, and window discipline for rhythm claims; not `U.Rhythm`. |
| temporalScaleDeclaration | Optional declaration of the time scale that carries the authored temporal claim used beyond the local working context: spot, episode, sprint, life-cycle time scale, learning-cycle, technoevolution, lifetime, or domain-local. | Use only when scale changes the claim's supported use, bearer, evidence, or reopen condition; it is not a new temporal kind. |
| validityWindowRef | The period or condition over which the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` remains valid. | Carries the refresh or reopen condition. |
| rateChangeIntent | The intended temporal move: accelerate, decelerate, brake, redirect, coast, pause, stabilize, widen, narrow, recover, sustain, or domain-local move. | Avoids acceleration-only bias. |
| interventionRegime | The intervention pattern: impulse, scheduled, feedback, adaptive, exploratory, or policy rule. | Uses planning, control, or policy patterns when formal. |
| controlHorizon | The horizon over which a control-style intervention is evaluated or adjusted. | Use only for `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` claims. |
| closedLoopUpdate | The feedback or update rule by which later observations change the intervention. | Uses control or model patterns when reusable or formal. |
| behaviorPolicyRef | The source policy, regime, or practice that produced the evidence being reused. | Use only when policy or regime evidence is used to make another policy or adaptive claim. |
| proposedPolicyRef | The proposed or evaluation policy, regime, rollout, or intervention rule being argued for. | Separate from `behaviorPolicyRef`; otherwise off-policy transfer is hidden. |
| offPolicyRisk | Risk that evidence from one policy or regime does not carry another policy or regime use. | Uses sequential decision or evaluation discipline. |
| stopRule | Condition for stopping, braking, pausing, replanning, or exiting the intervention. | Carries affordability and harm-control condition. |
| controlPolicyRelationRef | The FPF pattern relation used when the claim needs formal dynamics, search-policy health, agentic action, or evaluation relation: `U.Dynamics`, C.19, C.24, or an evaluation pattern. | C.27 records the crossing; the referenced pattern carries the required control or policy discipline. |
| plannedEffortRef | Reference to planned effort in WorkPlan, MethodDescription, resource envelope, or planning pattern. | Ex ante plan, not actual burn. |
| actualEffortTraceRef | Reference to observed work, resource burn, time burn, or trace. | Cites `U.Work` or `Gamma_work`, not `U.Dynamics`. |
| inputCharacteristicRefs | Characteristics treated as inputs to a dynamics or intervention claim. | Existing characteristic or model discipline. |
| effortProfile | Mapping from time window to effort or input condition. | Pattern-local description of effort timing; not a new law. |
| claimedInterventionApplier | Three-branch record for the system actor, the actual holder system reached through an exact system-role assignment, or another applier whose kind, existing RefKind, and subject pattern are recovered. | The record is not a RefKind or union kind and establishes no agency, Work, authority, policy application, or effect. |
| authorityRelationRef | Independently obtaining authority relation needed by the current claim. | An assignment or applier label supplies no authority by form; absence bounds supported use. |
| proposedWorkPlanRef | WorkPlan reference when the intervention is proposed but not performed. | Planning claim, not actual `U.Work` or authority. |
| hypotheticalUseNote | Short note when the claimed applier remains hypothetical or unresolved. | Blocks executable-Work and authority overread. |
| actorCapabilityRef | `U.Capability` reference only when an actual capability claim is being made. | Capability establishes neither agency, Work, assignment, authority, nor effect. |
| resistanceOrInertiaProxy | Domain-local reason that changing the rate is hard, delayed, sticky, or costly. | Proxy with explicit evidence, measurement, model assumption, planning assumption, or unknown marker; not literal mass. |
| resistanceProxyFamily | Pattern-local grouping of resistance and inertia proxy: lag, queue, habit, constraint, coordination cost, technical debt, operations-service demand, physical inertia, or domain-local family. | Plain-to-Tech mapping must stay explicit; this is not a `U.Kind`. |
| resistanceProxyEvidenceOrAssumption | Qualitative judgement, measurement reference, model assumption reference, planning assumption, or unknown marker for the resistance or inertia proxy. | Prevents assumptions from being treated as evidence relations or measurement relations. |
| evidenceRef | Evidence reference used by a field. | Uses evidence patterns. |
| interventionConstraintRefs | Resource, safety, service, legal, ethical, quality, or domain constraints that bound the intervention. | C.27 does not define or test these constraints; it records only that they are active. |
| resourceEnvelopeRef | Resource boundary for the intervention. | Planning pattern or resource pattern. |
| safetyEnvelopeRef | Safety boundary for the intervention. | Assurance pattern or safety pattern. |
| serviceEnvelopeRef | Service boundary or operational envelope. | Service, promise, or boundary pattern. |
| legalOrEthicalEnvelopeRef | Legal, ethical, or compliance boundary. | Legal, ethics, or assurance pattern. |
| qualityEnvelopeRef | Quality boundary affected by acceleration, braking, or rate-change. | Quality pattern such as C.25 where applicable. |
| uncertaintyClaim | Declared uncertainty around model, measurement, evidence relation, stability, or transfer. | May require downgrade or a higher evidence relation. |
| C28CausalUseRelationRef | Reference to the `C.28` causal-use question and records when a Dyn2 temporal claim is being used causally. | C.27 does not supply a `C.28`-governed causal-use claim by itself; use `dyn2CausalUseRelation?` only when causal use is being made. |
| causalInterventionSpecRef | The intervention, effort, workshop, policy, regime, practice change, or other action being treated as causal. | C.27 may name it; `C.28` carries the causal intervention spec, estimand, assumptions, identification, realizability, and evidence design, and supported causal-use judgement. |
| comparatorOrCounterfactualRef | Comparator, contrast case, counterfactual, control group, prior regime, or declared absence of one. | Required when causal reading is being made; otherwise the claim remains planning or diagnostic. |
| timeZeroOrAssignmentWindow | The start, assignment, exposure, or intervention window for the causal reading. | Keeps before-and-after slope claims from hiding timing ambiguity. |
| followUpWindowRef | The outcome observation window after intervention or exposure. | Separate from claim, sampling, effort, rhythm, and validity windows when they differ. |
| outcomeMeasureRef | The measured outcome whose change is being causally read. | Uses C.16 and evidence discipline when FPF-governed. |
| estimandRef | The `U.CausalEstimand` being estimated when a temporal claim is used causally. | Defined by `C.28`; C.27 only cites it when a temporal claim is used causally. |
| causalAssumptionSetRef | Assumptions under which the causal, model, or evaluation claim holds. | Uses `C.28`; not hidden inside C.27 shorthand. |
| rivalCauseSetRef | Alternative causes that could explain observed rate-change. | Uses `C.28`; required when causal reading is being made. |
| causalIdentificationProfileRef | Identification strategy, graph proof, calculus proof, data-regime argument, or bound used for the causal claim. | Delegates to `C.28`; absent identification limits supported causal use. |
| causalUseEvidenceDesignRef | Experiment, quasi-experiment, target-trial emulation, counterfactual sampling, simulation validation, or other causal evidence-design reference. | Uses `C.28`; absent design limits supported causal use. |
| offPolicyCausalEvaluationProfileRef | Off-policy, sequential, or adaptive policy-evaluation relation when rate-change or policy-improvement wording depends on logged behavior or replay. | Uses `C.28`; C.27 does not own off-policy causal evaluation. |
| supportedCausalUse | The causal conclusion or decision use carried by the `C.28` causal-use relation. | Must stay within the declared design, assumptions, outcome evidence, and uncertainty. |
| unsupportedCausalUse | Causal conclusion, action, or assurance claim not carried by the `C.28` causal-use relation. | Prevents C.27 temporal adequacy from laundering into causal-use claim. |
| comparedClaimRefs | Claims, methods, variants, practices, agents, or regimes being compared by dynamic outcome. | `G.9` carries parity; C.27 names the dynamic claim question of the comparison. |
| dynOrderCompared | Whether the comparison is Dyn1 rate or trend comparison, or Dyn2 intervention-sensitive rate-change comparison. | Prevents rate comparison from being laundered into intervention superiority. |
| baselineWindowRef | Baseline or starting window used by the comparison. | Must not be mixed silently across compared claims. |
| adaptationOrInterventionWindowRef | Window in which adaptation, effort, intervention, rollout, training, or practice change occurs. | Optional; required when Dyn2 comparison depends on intervention timing. |
| budgetOrEffortParityRef | Budget, effort, resource, or work-parity reference needed for fair dynamic comparison. | Uses `G.9`, work, and resource patterns when FPF-governed. |
| rateOrRateChangeReadingMeasureRef | Measurement reference used as evidence for compared rate, recovery, rhythm, throughput, or rate-change reading. | Uses C.16 measurement discipline. |
| G9ParityPlanRef | `G.9` parity plan reference for baseline, freshness, comparator, bridge, and evidence pins. | Mandatory when benchmark parity is FPF-governed. |
| G9ParityReportRef | Optional `G.9` parity report reference carrying outcomes and evidence. | Needed for published or benchmark used beyond the local working context result. |
| evidenceBranches | Decomposition of evidence by state, rate, rate-change, effort, resistance, rhythm, or causal effect. | Shows which branches are evidence and which remain assumptions. |
| stateEvidenceRefs | Evidence for state reading or snapshot. | Evidence relation or C.16 relation. |
| rateEvidenceRefs | Evidence for rate, trend, or trajectory reading. | Evidence relation or C.16 relation. |
| rateChangeEvidenceRefs | Evidence for rate-change or intervention-sensitive reading. | Evidence relation or C.16 relation. |
| effortEvidenceRefs | Evidence for planned or actual effort. | Planning relation or work relation. |
| resistanceEvidenceRefs | Evidence for resistance or inertia proxy. | Domain evidence relation. |
| rhythmEvidenceRefs | Evidence for rhythm, cadence, or coupling. | Rhythm proxy relation or evidence relation. |
| causalEvidenceRefs | Evidence for causal attribution. | `C.28` causal-use relation. |
| dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock | Declared relation when a Dyn2 temporal claim moves across holon levels, bearers, or aggregation. | Unsupported unless aggregation relation, bearer continuity, and mix-shift risk are addressed. |
| sourceBearerRef | Bearer where evidence or claim originates. | Existing bearer reference. |
| targetBearerRef | Target bearer for boundary-crossing use. | Existing bearer reference. |
| aggregationRelation | Rule or evidence relation by which local and aggregate readings are related. | Uses aggregation, model, or evidence pattern. |
| mixShiftRisk | Risk that composition changes explain the apparent rate-change. | Must be named before cross-scale transfer. |
| crossScaleTransferUseBoundary | Whether cross-scale transfer is carried by declared bearer continuity and aggregation relation, remains unsupported, or is unknown. | Prevents aggregate acceleration laundering. |
| accelerationDebt | Consequence or residue created by sustained acceleration, braking, recovery, stabilization, or redirection: rework, operations-service demand, quality loss, burnout, risk, hidden queue, or coordination cost. | Use only when supported use relies on sustained acceleration, braking, recovery, or stabilization, or when the domain can retain residue after effort changes or stops. |
| debtKind | Kind of debt or residue. | Domain-local, with evidence if FPF-governed. |
| debtWindowRef | Window over which debt appears or must be repaid. | Separate from effort and claim windows when needed. |
| reversibilityClaim | Whether the dynamic change is reversible, costly to reverse, irreversible within window, or unknown. | `unknown` is allowed; it bounds supported use instead of forcing theory-building. |
| reversibilityNote | Short explanation of why reversibility has that claim value. | Captures hysteresis and residue only when FPF-governed. |
| hysteresisOrResidue | What remains after effort changes or stops. | Domain-local description requiring evidence when FPF-governed. |
| repaymentOrBrakePlan | Plan to repay debt, brake, recover, or stabilize. | Planning pattern or assurance pattern if FPF-governed. |
| debtHysteresisRelationRef | Cited pattern relation for planning, assurance, quality, wellbeing, or safety relation when debt or hysteresis is FPF-governed. | C.27 records the temporal-claim question; referenced patterns carry the required discipline. |
| brakeOrRecoveryPlan | Plan for braking, recovery, stabilization, or rollback. | Planning pattern or assurance pattern when FPF-governed. |
| supportedUse | The uses this C.27 temporal-claim record can carry. | Must match `dynClaimUseClass` and the named evidence relation, model assumption, planning assumption, or neighbouring-pattern relation. |
| unsupportedUse | Nearby uses this note or profile cannot carry. | Prevents hidden escalation. |
| reopenTrigger | Condition that requires refresh, downgrade, a higher-demand evidence relation, measurement relation, model relation, or reference to another pattern. | Evolvability trigger for the claim. |

C.27 has a small core. Specialized cases are C.27 dynamic-claim relations
or optional profile blocks for authored temporal claims used beyond the local working context; they are not mandatory rules
for every C.27 use.

These entries are not a general relation list. They apply only after an
authored temporal claim already has C.27 relevance because it changes supported use.
Each entry names the neighbouring FPF pattern to inspect when that C.27-typed
dynamic claim also depends on one non-C.27 question. If the text has no state,
rate, rate-change, rhythm, regime, recovery, stabilization, transfer, or
intervention relation that changes supported use, no entry here applies.

| Dynamic-claim relation | C.27 relation and next FPF pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Formal dynamics | Reusable law, simulation, prediction, control, or calibrated dynamics is carried by `A.3.3 U.Dynamics`, `C.16`, work evidence, `G.9`, and assurance patterns. |
| C.16 rate measurement relation | Rate and rate-change readings used as evidence, benchmark, gate, control, or C.27 profile use include `c16RateMeasurementRelationRef?`; C.27 cites `C16MeasurementRelationRef` and does not define measurement construction or comparability. |
| C.27 effort and Work block | `dyn2EffortWorkBlock?` separates planned effort, method description, resource envelope, actual `U.Work` or `Gamma_work` trace, effort window, the kind-discriminated `claimedInterventionApplier`, any exact system-role assignment used to recover its holder system, independently obtaining authority, proposed WorkPlan, hypothetical-use note, and `U.Capability` reference when a capability claim is current. A.15 and F.6 carry assignment, method, planning, and Work attribution. |
| C.27 resistance and inertia block | `dyn2ResistanceInertiaBlock?` names resistance proxy family, the evidence relation, measurement relation, model assumption, planning assumption, or unknown result for that proxy, and unsupported downstream claim, effect, or use; `resistanceProxyEvidenceOrAssumption = unknown` may carry local diagnostic use but blocks durable acceleration, causal, benchmark, promise-like, or assurance use. |
| C.27 rhythm claim block | `dyn2RhythmClaimBlock?` names bearer, timing reference, window, proxy relation, evidence relation, and supported use; coupling, phase, synchronization, or entrainment-like details appear only when the supported use depends on a relation between bearers. |
| C.27 causal-use relation | `dyn2CausalUseRelation?` is present only when a rate-change or intervention claim is used to make a causal-use claim; it requires `causalInterventionSpecRef`, contrast or counterfactual, timing, outcome, assumptions, rival causes, supported causal use, unsupported causal use, and `C.28` causal-use relation. |
| C.27 dynamic benchmark requirement | `dyn2BenchmarkParityBlock?` declares the rate, rate-change, rhythm, recovery, or intervention-effect requirement of a comparison; it is a benchmark input declaration, not a benchmark harness. `G.9` carries baseline, freshness, comparator, bridge, parity plan, and parity report discipline. |
| C.27 metric-as-target block | `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` splits metric-as-measure, metric-as-target or incentive, metric publication as temporal intervention, and residual probe, frame, or export cue; C.16 carries measurement, E.13 or an assurance pattern carries proxy distortion, and C.26 applies only after ordinary FPF pattern relations leave residual QL cue. |
| C.27 cross-scale transfer field | `dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?` keeps local and aggregate dynamic readings separate; cross-scale use needs source bearer, target bearer, aggregation relation, bearer continuity, mix-shift risk, and explicit `crossScaleTransferUseBoundary`. |
| Object-centric dynamic trace | Work-flow rate or process-rate claims need bearer, object trace or event trace, interaction, and convergence or divergence discipline rather than one generic process-speed label. |
| Method composition or emergent work cycle | If the claim being made is about how method parts compose, how an adaptive work cycle becomes a capability, or how repeated practice changes shape, C.27 handles only the temporal adequacy of the rate, rhythm, recovery, stabilization, or rate-change claim. `B.1.5` carries order-sensitive method composition and work enactment; `B.2.4` carries meta-functional transition and capability-emergence questions. |
| State-change or evolution loop and language-state movement | If the claim being made is that a system, episteme, method, cue, branch, or language-state relation evolved, reopened, stabilized, operationalized, retired, or moved through a named state-change sequence, C.27 handles only the temporal adequacy of any speed, rhythm, recovery, or stabilization claim. `A.4` and `B.4` carry temporal duality and canonical evolution loops; `A.16` and `B.4.1` carry language-state move and cue-stabilization discipline. |
| C.27 scale-variable claim block | `dyn2ScaleVariableClaimBlock?` is present only when changing review capacity, tool calls, tokens, sprints, data, model capacity, parallelism, freedom of action, or another declared scale variable is used to make a rate-change, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization claim; C.18.1 carries scale variables, scale windows, scale probes, and scale-elasticity value. |
| Autonomy-budget or freedom-of-action claim | If freedom of action, action tokens, decision tokens, guard cadence, depletion, pause or resume, or autonomy-gated work is used to make a rate-change or stabilization claim, C.27 states the temporal claim only. `E.16` carries autonomy budgets, guard checks, ledger evidence, depletion behavior, and override speech acts. |
| C.27 viability-envelope relation | `dyn2ViabilityEnvelopeRelation?` is present only when braking, throttling, rollout speed, cadence change, recovery timing, adaptation cost, or stabilization is used to keep a declared viability bearer inside usable bounds; C.26.3 carries viability-envelope boundary regulation. |
| Publication-unit stability around temporal wording | When a paragraph, note, working section, comparison, explanation, or decision-facing text mixes method-description, repeated-practice, service-boundary, rhythm, capability-claim, improvement, benchmark, and promise wording so that the publication-unit primary entity of concern or active claim question is unstable, use E.17.AUD, E.17.ID.CR, or the relevant publication-unit pattern first. C.27 is active only when a temporal-claim adequacy question remains after that stabilization. |
| C.27 control or policy relation | `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` is present only for `controlModel`, `policyRule`, `adaptive`, `planningModel` with feedback relation, or explicit C.24, C.19, or evaluation relations; C.27 records the crossing and names the pattern that carries formal control, MPC, RL, or policy evaluation. |
| Dynamic policy transfer | Pattern-reference-only inside `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?`: sequential decision and evaluation discipline carries behavior-policy, evaluation-policy, and off-policy transfer claims rather than default C.27 fields. |
| Exploration and exploitation | C.19 carries policy health for search, convergence, narrowing, widening, and switching-rate claims. |
| Creative or open-ended search speed | Claims about faster novelty, illumination, archive growth, frontier coverage, candidate generation, or candidate-set improvement use C.17 for novelty and value measures, C.18 for open-ended search calculus, and C.19 for pool policy; C.27 only names the temporal adequacy question when speed or change affects supported use. |
| Task-family adaptation speed | If the claim concerns acquiring usable specialization on one declared `TaskFamilyRef` or `TaskSignature`, C.27 types the learning-rate or adaptation-rate question and C.22.1 carries threshold target, time-to-threshold, budget-to-threshold, prior exposure, transfer, retention, downside, and corridor-entry evidence. |
| C.27 debt and hysteresis block | `dyn2DebtHysteresisBlock?` is present only when supported use depends on sustained acceleration, braking, recovery, stabilization, residue after effort changes, or high-stakes, promise, or gate use; `unknown` reversibility is allowed but bounds supported use. |
| Promise, boundary, or service acceptance | `A.2.3`, `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, `A.6.C`, `F.12`, and assurance patterns carry service promises, SLA-like statements, agreement-language expectations, release gates, public commitments, boundary obligations, and service-acceptance bindings. |
| Evidence and provenance relation | If a C.27 card or profile cites traces, assumptions, work evidence, evidence carriers, `PathId`, `PathSlice`, validity window, or evidence decay, C.27 states the temporal reading that needs an evidence relation. When the cited evidence object is path-shaped, `A.10` and `G.6` carry evidence graph referring, provenance references, citable path and slice discipline, and SCR-visible or RSCR-visible evidence bindings; `B.3` and `B.3.4` carry assurance claim, evidence decay, and epistemic debt. |
| Dashboard telemetry, pack shipping, or refresh use | If a dashboard, time-series, telemetry pin, RSCR trigger, shipped pack, discipline-health slot, or dashboard slice is used as evidence for improvement, decay, recovery, stabilization, or rate-change, C.27 names the temporal-claim adequacy question. `C.21` carries discipline-health slot meaning; `G.12` carries DHC series, row, and slice construction and telemetry-pin publication; `G.10` carries pack shipping; `G.11` carries refresh and decay orchestration; `G.6` carries path and slice evidence visibility. |
| Transformation-flow, gate, or crossing use | If a C.27-typed temporal claim is used as a `GateCheckRef` input, `GateDecisionRationale`, `LaunchGate` condition, `PathSlice` refresh trigger, crossing condition, or published flow condition, C.27 states only the temporal-claim adequacy question. `E.18`, `A.20`, and `A.21` carry the selected transformation-flow structure, `OperationalGate(profile)`, `ConstraintValidity`, `GateFit`, `DecisionLog`, `PathSlice`, `SquareLaw`, `Gamma_time`, and crossing pins. |
| Derivative noise | Noisy rate-change readings used for comparison, benchmark, gate, or control need sampling window and stability or noise class, or downgrade. |
| Coasting | Coasting needs evidence or an assumption when continued movement or stability after effort changes or stops carries the claim. |
| High-stakes temporal action | Pattern-reference-only relation: high-stakes acceleration, braking, or redirection claims name the temporal action, window, and unsupported use and cite the applicable harm, resource, quality envelope, assurance, ethics, legal, safety, financial, or human-wellbeing pattern. |
| C.26 residual relation | C.27 does not add QL relation. If a Dyn2 claim also depends on probe, frame, order, export, or coarsening residue that ordinary FPF patterns cannot carry, C.26 carries the residue after ordinary C.27, C.24, C.16, G.9, and E.13 pattern relations are named. |
| No new publication role | `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` and `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` are pattern-local records or cards, not new Part G publication roles, MVPK faces, primary EntityOfConcern values of related FPF patterns, or U-kinds. |
| Use-triggered lint | Useful lint requires temporal-improvement wording plus decision, comparison, budget, benchmark, gate, promise, publication, assurance, or intervention-plan use. |

Plain words may remain didactic. Tech prose must name the FPF pattern that carries the FPF-governed question.
Problem frames and worked examples may use speed, force, inertia,
acceleration, rhythm, cadence, agility, or process-speed language when it helps
recognition. Field definitions, conformance requirements, and references to other
FPF patterns should use the Tech readings below.
Minted C.27-local labels must carry the dynamic claim question in the label: use
`Dyn2`, `Temporal`, `RateChange`, `Rhythm`, `Inertia`,
`CrossScale`, `MetricTarget`, `ControlPolicy`, or another explicit dynamic
qualifier. A generic head such as `Profile`, `Card`, `Process`, `Service`,
`Practice`, `Policy`, `Harm`, `OperationalSupport`, or `Envelope` is not enough by itself.
Ordinary prose may use those words only as Plain examples or after resolving the
actual FPF kind and reference or the applicable FPF pattern.

| Plain wording | FPF-safe Tech reading |
| --- | --- |
| speed | rate, throughput, tempo, or trajectory reading with C.16 measurement relation when FPF-governed |
| acceleration | rate-change, regime transition, policy effect, or finite-difference reading |
| effort or force | planned effort, input characteristic, claimed intervention applier, exact system-role assignment when used, actual Work trace, resource trace, or resource envelope |
| mass or inertia | domain-local resistance or inertia proxy: lag, switching cost, coordination cost, queue pressure, habit persistence, physical inertia, or constraint |
| rhythm or cadence | interval-structured bearer, timing reference, window, and evidence relation; coupling only for cross-bearer claims |
| agility | braking, redirection, acceleration, stabilization, recovery, and constraint handling |
| process sped up | first resolve the bearer as system, work, method description, service promise, service boundary, or event-log view; then add the C.27 temporal-claim question only if rate-change use is being made |
| more tool calls or more context | agentic action whose rate under concern must be named, not automatic acceleration |

Avoid as Tech tokens unless the named pattern already defines them:
`carrierOrSubject`, `D2DynamicsProfile`, `Metric`, `Axis`, `Dimension`,
`Process`, `Practice`, `Service`, generic card names, `Profile`, `ProcessBearer`,
`PolicyEvaluation`, `HarmEnvelope`, `force`, `mass`, `acceleration`, and
`rhythm`.

Prefer: `DynOrder`, `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`,
`entityOfConcernRef`, `temporalBearerRef`, `profileCarrierRef`,
`baseCharacteristicRef`, `MeasureRef`, `DHCMethodRef`, `claimWindowRef`,
`samplingWindowRef`, `effortWindowRef`, `rhythmWindowRef`,
`plannedEffortRef`, `actualEffortTraceRef`, `inputCharacteristicRefs`,
`claimedInterventionApplier`, `authorityRelationRef`, `proposedWorkPlanRef`,
`hypotheticalUseNote`, `actorCapabilityRef`, `resistanceOrInertiaProxy`,
`resistanceProxyEvidenceOrAssumption`,
`dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?`, `dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?`,
`dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?`, `dyn2HighStakesTemporalActionRelation?`,
`supportedUse`, `unsupportedUse`, and `reopenTrigger`.

The dynamic-order labels are values of a claim classification, not kinds of
things. Dyn0, Dyn1, and Dyn2 classify what a temporal claim treats as sufficient
for its use. They do not become `U.Dyn0`, `U.Dyn1`, `U.Dyn2`,
`U.Acceleration`, `U.Rhythm`, `U.Practice`, `U.Force`, or
`U.SecondOrderProcess`.

Kind-locality rule: `DynOrder`, `Dyn0`, `Dyn1`, `Dyn2`,
`Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, and `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` name readings
or records of authored temporal claims. They do not classify the primary EntityOfConcern
itself unless an existing FPF pattern separately types that EntityOfConcern. "Team
throughput accelerated" may receive a Dyn2 claim reading; the team does not
become a `Dyn2System`, throughput does not become `U.Acceleration`, and the
card or profile does not become a dynamics law.

`Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` is a pattern-local episteme record about the adequacy of
a temporal claim. It is not `U.Dynamics`, `U.Work`, `U.WorkPlan`,
`U.MethodDescription`, `U.Measure`, or `CharacteristicSpace`. If materialized
as a document, card, table, or file, that material is a carrier of the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`
content, not the actual work, process, law, practice, or system being discussed.

A.7 EntityOfConcern, Description episteme, and publication-carrier split: `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` and
`Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` are authored descriptions of temporal-claim adequacy.
They are not the dynamic system, not the work trace, not the measure, not the
service promise, not the claimed intervention applier or cited system-role assignment, not the dynamics law, and not identical to the
document, card, or page that carries them.

The EntityOfConcern, temporal bearer, and carrier split is:

| Object | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `entityOfConcernRef` | the entity, work, method, system, or practice-like EntityOfConcern the claim discusses, resolved through existing FPF kinds where FPF-governed |
| `temporalBearerRef` | the bearer whose state, rate, rhythm, or regime is being read |
| `profileCarrierRef` | optional card, file, or page carrier of the `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` content, only when publication or evidence needs it |
| `plannedEffortRef` | plan, method, or resource-envelope reference for intended effort |
| `actualEffortTraceRef` | `U.Work` or `Gamma_work` trace for actual burn |
| `dynamicsModelRef` | `U.Dynamics` reference when a law or model of change is claimed |

Loose words require resolution in Tech prose. A process may be a method recipe,
dated work run, transition law, event-log view, or service situation. A practice
may be method description plus work traces. A service claim may involve system,
promise content, delivery work, boundary semantics, or assurance. C.27 should
not use these as untyped substitutes for named FPF kinds and references.

**Copy-paste authoring forms (informative).** These forms make C.27 cheap enough
to use without jumping straight to a full profile.

**AI-assisted drafting rule (informative).** An AI-assisted draft may propose
that C.27 is relevant, but a profile appears only after the supported use and the
boundary-crossing reason are named. First classify the prose as ordinary prose,
Dyn0, Dyn1, Dyn2 card, or profile or pattern relation. The draft does not infer:
more tool calls means better reasoning; faster narrowing means better search;
higher throughput means better quality; metric improvement means system
improvement; or trend means intervention model.

### C.27:5 - Archetypal Grounding

Read these cases before the fuller field definitions. They show supported stopping points for ordinary work:

- no C.27 record for ordinary state, metaphor, or unsupported broad-use language;
- Dyn1 or C.16 when the issue under repair is only measured rate;
- `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` when a local temporal intervention, rhythm, braking, coasting, or tool-use rate-change claim needs a bounded evidence relation, model assumption, planning assumption, or neighbouring-pattern relation;
- `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` or a named FPF pattern relation only when the authored temporal claim is used beyond the local working context, benchmarks, promises, assures, becomes causal, crosses scale, or carries decision-use that affects gate, release, assurance, benchmark, or work-plan use.

**Example breadth (informative).** C.27 appears across several work domains, not
only project-velocity prose.

| Domain | Example | Why C.27 cares |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Software operations | Incident recovery became faster after a playbook. | Promise, viability, and service-boundary risk can hide inside a recovery-speed claim. |
| Team work cycle | Backlog reduction under added reviewers. | Effort, window, resistance, and hidden work must be named. |
| AI agent | More tool calls speed debugging. | Tool-call count is effort evidence or input evidence, not reasoning-quality evidence. |
| Benchmark | Method A improves faster than Method B. | Dynamic comparison needs G.9 parity, not only C.27 prose. |
| Metric target | Velocity target improves velocity. | Metric-as-measure, target pressure, work change, proxy distortion, and residual probe cue stay distinct. |
| Search | Faster shortlist. | Faster narrowing can damage exploration health and frontier coverage. |
| Learning | Time-to-threshold on one task family. | C.22.1 carries task-family adaptation signature. |
| Rhythm and practice | Daily drills stabilize review rhythm. | Rhythm needs bearer, timing reference, window, evidence proxy, and supported use. |
| Scale | More tokens, data, or reviewers improve rate. | C.18.1 carries scale variable and scale-elasticity value. |
| Cross-scale | Team throughput becomes organization agility. | Aggregation relation, bearer continuity, and mix shift must be visible. |
| Viability | Slow rollout protects operations-service capacity. | Braking can be the adequate temporal move; slowing down is a supported envelope-regulation outcome when acceleration would damage recovery, operations-service demand, or promise reliability. |
| QL negative | Dashboard or probe wording appears. | C.26 is relevant only for residual probe, frame, export, or coarsening cue after ordinary pattern relations. |

Teaching cases:

| Case | Example | Expected classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Snapshot | "Backlog is 120 items today." | Dyn0; no C.27 record unless use changes. |
| Trend | "Backlog fell by 20 items/week." | Dyn1 with C.16 measurement relation if FPF-governed. |
| Intervention | "Adding review capacity for two sprints will double backlog reduction rate." | `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` usually overkill unless the authored temporal claim is used beyond local pilot or plan use. |
| Benchmark or publication | "Method A improves faster than Method B and should be published as superior." | `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` or pattern reference is justified: G.9 benchmark parity, C.16 measurement, possible `C.28` causal-use relation, and C.27 dynamic-claim relation declaration. |
| Dynamic anti-leaderboard | "Both methods reached the same final score, so they are equivalent." | Not enough if adaptation window, effort parity, hidden rework, validity window, or recovery profile differs; G.9 carries parity and C.27 names the temporal parity question. |
| Agentic tool-use | "More tool calls will speed debugging." | C.24 plus `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; tool-call count is effort evidence or input evidence, not task-success, evidence-quality, repair-success, or cost evidence, so the claim names task outcome, evaluation harness, stop or replan condition, validity window, and unsupported use as a benchmark claim. |
| Scale trap | "Doubling reviewers, data, or model capacity will double improvement rate." | C.18.1 carries scale variable, scale window, probes, and scale-elasticity value; C.27 applies only if the scale claim is used to make a rate-change claim, and linear temporal improvement remains unsupported without evidence. |
| Rhythm and practice | "Daily drills stabilize training rhythm." | `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` with rhythm bearer, timing reference, window, evidence proxy, and supported use; coupling only if the claim depends on synchronization between bearers. |
| False positive | "This chapter accelerates reader orientation." | Usually ordinary prose; no C.27 record unless used as a claim about method effectiveness. |
| Causal trap | "Velocity rose after the workshop, so the workshop caused it." | C.27 marks the temporal-claim question only; `C.28` causal-use relation and evidence relation are required before causal use. |
| Cross-scale trap | "Team throughput accelerated, so every service improved." | `dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?` is unsupported without source bearer, target bearer, aggregation relation, bearer continuity, mix-shift risk, and `crossScaleTransferUseBoundary`. |
| Braking | "Slow rollout protects operations-service capacity." | `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` or `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` depending on supported decision; the move may be a correct protection of viability, not a failure to accelerate. |
Additional dynamic near-misses:

| Case | Example | Expected classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coasting | "Adoption continues after incentives stop." | `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` with coasting evidence or assumption and reopen trigger. |
| High-stakes temporal action | "We can cut review time in half for this regulated release." | Pattern-reference-only `dyn2HighStakesTemporalActionRelation?` plus assurance, legal, or quality relation, or claim downgraded. |
| Premature convergence | "The search process is better because we reached a shortlist faster." | C.19 relation; distinguish faster narrowing from healthy search. |
| Metric target | "Velocity improved after becoming the quarterly target." | `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` only if target publication changes temporal behavior and supported use; C.16 carries measurement, E.13 or proxy audit carries utility distortion, and C.26 applies only for residual probe, frame, or export cue. |
| Scale-variable fantasy | "More data, model capacity, reviewers, tokens, or parallelism will improve twice as fast." | C.18.1 carries scale variables, scale windows, scale probes, and scale-elasticity value; C.27 only names the temporal claim when the scale variable is used to make a rate-change, learning, recovery, throughput, or stabilization claim. |
| Off-policy transfer | "The old rollout policy improved recovery, so the new rollout policy will too." | `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` must name `behaviorPolicyRef`, `proposedPolicyRef`, `offPolicyRisk`, and evaluation or control relation; one observed slope under policy A does not carry policy B. |
| Object-centric process trace | "The process sped up" while orders, invoices, shipments, and service tickets move through different event traces. | `dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?` recovers object types, event trace, interactions, aggregation relation, and unsupported whole work-cycle truth; one scalar throughput line is not enough. |
| Harmful acceleration and viability | "Faster rollout improved release velocity while operations-service demand and recovery time degraded." | C.27 names acceleration, braking, throttling, recovery timing, and unsupported downstream claim, effect, or use; C.26.3, C.25, assurance, safety, legal, ethics, or wellbeing patterns carry the envelope or harm claim. |

These slices show what C.27 changes in use. They are action examples, not extra forms to fill.

Operations: backlog acceleration:

```text
Claim:
Adding two triage engineers for two sprints will double backlog reduction rate.

C.27 reading:
Dyn2, because a rate-change is tied to a planned intervention.

Minimum useful note:
- rate being changed: backlog reduction per week;
- effort or input: two triage engineers assigned through a WorkPlan for two sprints;
- effort window: sprint N and N+1;
- resistance proxy: review queue coordination cost and domain ramp-up;
- evidence or assumption relation: planning assumption plus prior work trace if available;
- supported use: staffing discussion and local plan choice;
- unsupported use: `C.28`-governed causal-use claim with estimand and identification relation, long-term capacity model, benchmark superiority;
- reopen trigger: queue mix shift, triage saturation, quality loss, or no
  measured reduction after the first sprint.
```

The value is not that every backlog sentence gets a profile. The value is that an
acceleration claim used for a decision cannot hide effort, window, resistance, and
unsupported downstream claim, effect, or use.

Learning: practice transfer:

```text
Claim:
Daily 20-minute drills stabilize the learner's problem-solving rhythm.

C.27 reading:
Dyn2 only if the claim is used to select, compare, publish, or justify the
practice. Otherwise it may remain didactic.

Minimum useful note:
- rhythm bearer: learner practice session;
- rhythm timing reference: daily drill window and task cycle;
- rhythm proxy or evidence relation: task completion cadence, error pattern, recall delay,
  or observed practice trace;
- effort profile: short scheduled effort repeated across days;
- resistance proxy: fatigue, attention drift, task novelty, or habit formation;
- supported use: local practice design;
- unsupported use: general proof that the method improves all learning;
- reopen trigger: retention falls, task family changes, or rhythm proxy stops
  matching actual performance.
```

This carries the source article's replicable-practice idea: the useful formal
payload is an effort, rhythm, and window description that can be copied and checked,
not a forced equation.

Rhythm and practice style vignette:

```text
Claim:
A training note says "this practice rhythm improves retention", or a dance note
says "this style keeps swing content".

C.27 reading:
Dyn2 only when the rhythm or style claim is used to teach, replicate, compare,
judge, benchmark, or promise a practice outcome. Otherwise it may remain
ordinary explanatory prose.

Minimum useful questions:
- rhythm of what bearer: learner, team, body movement, practice session,
  release cycle, or other named FPF kind and reference?
- referenced to what beat, cycle, release train, attention window, task cycle, or
  domain-local interval?
- what effort or rate-change pattern occurs in which intervals?
- what evidence relation, measurement relation, instrument proxy, model assumption, or planning assumption supplies that reading?
- what use is carried: teaching orientation, replication, judging, benchmark,
  or promise?
```

This keeps the article's useful dance and practice insight: style distinction may
depend on effort and rate-change patterns over rhythm intervals, not only on
static poses, single trajectories, mood words, or a general rhythm theory.

Rhythm: embodied or team coordination:

```text
Claim:
The team's release rhythm became smoother after moving review earlier in the
cycle.

C.27 reading:
Dyn2 when this carries a method-change, staffing-decision, or benchmark use.

Minimum useful note:
- rhythm bearer: team release cycle, not the repository file or dashboard;
- rhythm timing reference: release cycle and review window;
- intervention regime: scheduled shift of review earlier in the cycle;
- instrument proxy: event log, review queue cadence, rework trace, or survey
  only if its resistance-proxy evidence relation, measurement relation, model assumption, planning assumption, or explicit unknown result is stated;
- resistance proxy: transfer delay, queue pressure, coordination lag;
- supported use: local method adjustment;
- unsupported use: proof of organizational agility or service promise;
- reopen trigger: work mix changes, release train changes, or hidden rework
  appears.
```

The important correction is that rhythm has a bearer and proxy. It is not a
decorative label for good mood or smoothness.

Agentic tool-use: AI work cycle:

```text
Claim:
More tool calls will speed debugging.

C.27 reading:
Dyn2 only if the extra calls are used as an intervention claim, not merely as a
local tactic.

Minimum useful note:
- rate being changed: bug localization, evidence confirmation, repair
  iteration, uncertainty reduction, or rollout stabilization;
- effort or input: extra tool calls, broader search, or deeper context retrieval;
- `claimedInterventionApplier`: select the branch that is actually supported. For a tool-using System, name that admitted System; if an assignment is cited, name the holder System and exact assignment but do not make the assignment the applier; for another applier, name its admitted kind and subject pattern. Keep any capability claim, proposed WorkPlan, authority relation, actual Work and F.6 attribution, claimed effect, and evidence separate; if only a plan or capability is known, do not report performed Work or an effect;
- resistance proxy: noisy output, context overload, search branching, cost, or
  stale evidence;
- outcome and evaluation evidence: task success, repair success, evidence quality,
  cost, and validity window if the claim is benchmark-facing;
- stop or replan trigger: no new evidence, conflicting evidence, timeout, rising
  cost, expired validity window, or growing false-positive queue pressure;
- unsupported use: "more calls means better reasoning", "faster narrowing is
  always better", or "tool-call count proves benchmark superiority."
```

This keeps C.24 useful without turning tool-use quantity into a proxy for
thinking quality.

Benchmark: faster improvement:

```text
Claim:
Method A improves faster than Method B.

C.27 reading:
Use `G.9` for benchmark parity; `dyn2BenchmarkParityBlock?` types the dynamic
outcome and records unsupported benchmark use.

Minimum useful note:
- compared claims: Method A and Method B;
- dynamic order: Dyn1 if only rates are compared, Dyn2 if interventions,
  effort budgets, or rate-change are compared;
- comparable windows: baseline, sampling, claim, validity, and adaptation or
  effort windows;
- comparable effort: planned budget and actual effort trace if relevant;
- G.9 parity: `G9ParityPlanRef` for baseline, freshness, comparator, and bridge pins,
  and `G9ParityReportRef?` if a published or reused report exists;
- hidden costs: rework, operations-service demand, quality loss, burnout, or debt;
- supported use: benchmark interpretation under stated parity;
- unsupported use: causal superiority, universal method superiority, or release
  gate unless an applicable FPF pattern carries that claim.

```

This prevents "faster" from hiding unequal effort, unequal windows, or unequal
measurement templates.

Service-boundary promise:

```text
Claim:
We recover incidents faster after the new playbook.

C.27 reading:
Dyn2 if the playbook is claimed to change recovery rate. If the statement is
used outside the local working context, as an SLA-like expectation, or as evidence for service-boundary acceptance, C.27 only
types the temporal-claim question.

Minimum useful note:
- rate being changed: detection-to-mitigation or mitigation-to-recovery time;
- effort or input: playbook, staffing, automation, triage method, or escalation
  policy;
- resistance proxy: incident mix, dependency lag, tool latency, coordination
  bottleneck;
- applicable relation: diagnostic evidence relation, benchmark input, causal-use relation, assurance claim, or promise-like boundary pattern;
- supported use: local incident-response improvement claim;
- unsupported use: formal guarantee, audit closure, release gate, or causal
  proof unless the relevant boundary, evidence, or assurance pattern carries it.
```

The key point is that C.27 does not become a hidden promise pattern. It prevents
temporal claims from silently widening into promises.

Aggregate or cross-scale transfer:

```text
Claim:
Team throughput accelerated, so the organization became more agile.

C.27 reading:
`dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?` applies; local team rate-change and organization
agility are different dynamic readings unless aggregation relation and bearer
continuity are declared.

Minimum useful note:
- source bearer: team work cycle and its measured throughput;
- target bearer: organization, portfolio, service family, or ecosystem;
- aggregation relation: how local rate-change maps upward;
- bearer continuity: whether the same work, service, value stream, or population
  remains comparable;
- mix-shift risk: easier work, hidden queues, reassigned work, changed scope, or
  invisible rework;
- crossScaleTransferUseBoundary: local-only, supported-transfer, unsupported-transfer, or unknown;
- supported use: local team improvement if the named evidence relation carries that use;
- unsupported use: organization-scope agility claim unless aggregation and
  quality-bundle relations are present.

```

This protects multi-scale FPF reasoning: a rate-change does not transfer across
holon levels merely because the same speed word appears at each holon level.

Metric-target temporal effect:

```text
Claim:
Velocity improved after it became the quarterly target.

C.27 reading:
`dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` may apply if metric publication or target use is a
temporal intervention. The central distinction is measurement, target or incentive,
real process change, and residual probe, frame, or export cue.

Minimum useful note:
- metric measure: the published velocity or throughput reading, with C.16 relation if
  measurement construction or comparability is FPF-governed;
- target or incentive use: quarterly target, gate, dashboard, budget signal, or
  public comparison;
- possible behavior change: smaller tickets, hidden work, quality reduction,
  postponed rework, selection of easier tasks;
- process and measurement split: measurement effect, probe effect, real work change,
  gaming or selection effect, causal effect if claimed;
- `E.13` or proxy relation: proxy distortion or utility distortion if velocity diverges from the
  actual work objective;
- C.26 relation: only if residual probe, frame, order, or export cue remains after
  C.27, C.16, and E.13 pattern relations;
- supported use: diagnostic investigation or metric design review;
- unsupported use: proof that the underlying work system improved.

```

This is the practical C.27 bridge: metric publication may be a temporal intervention, while C.16 carries measurement, `E.13` carries proxy or value distortion, C.26 carries only residual probe/frame/export cues, and evidence patterns carry the evidence relation.

### C.27:6 - Bias-Annotation

Use C.27 only where it helps a working reader notice temporal-claim inflation and choose the least-committing supported result: no C.27 record, Dyn0 reading, Dyn1 reading, a local `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, a boundary-crossing `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`, or a named neighbouring-pattern relation. A correct dynamic-claim schema is not enough. The useful result is that a working reader can notice when a state or rate reading is being used as a rate-change, rhythm-change, intervention, braking, coasting, recovery, stabilization, benchmark, promise, or assurance claim; choose the least-committing supported next output; and stop or cite the carrying pattern without making C.27 absorb the other concern.
The missing-question content belongs here only where it strengthens
three practical abilities:

- how a reader finds C.27 from ordinary working language such as speed up, slow
  down, recover, stabilize, sustain cadence, improve faster, change direction,
  or reduce risk faster;
- how source ideas become FPF-facing guidance without turning physical or dynamic metaphors into new ontology: adopted, adapted,
  carried by another FPF pattern, or rejected as literal dynamics ontology;
- how C.27 keeps higher-demand claim relations with existing FPF patterns instead of
  becoming a general pattern for measurement, dynamics law, work, search,
  benchmarks, promises, assurance, viability, publication-unit stability, or QL.

Additional detail is useful only when it improves one of those three abilities
or clarifies a stopping condition. More fields, case notes, or pattern-relation prose is
rejected when they only make C.27 harder to refuse, harder to stop, or easier to
misread as a general theory of change.

**Gov.** C.27 reduces hidden decision-claim inflation: local diagnosis, planning assumption or planning-model relation, benchmark use, public promise, and assurance use remain different claim uses.

**Arch.** C.27 is biased against stealing work from neighbouring patterns. It covers authored temporal-claim adequacy, while measurement, formal dynamics, work, search, benchmark, promise, causality, quality, value, viability, scale, adaptation, and QL relations stay with the applicable patterns.

**Ontology and episteme.** C.27 is biased toward described system, description, and carrier separation and toward explicit temporal-claim-use classification. It treats Dyn0, Dyn1, and Dyn2 as readings of authored temporal claims, not as kinds of systems.

**Pragmatics and didactics.** C.27 is biased toward cheap stopping, card-first use, and teaching through cases before field machinery. The first lesson is: a trend is not yet an intervention model.

### C.27:7 - Conformance Checklist

Use these requirements to judge whether a C.27 record or C.27-facing paragraph
is sufficiently supported for the use it is making. Ordinary local use can stay small.

| Requirement | C.27 content |
| --- | --- |
| Applicability | A C.27 record exists only when the temporal distinction changes supported use, the applicable pattern relation, evidence relation, model assumption, planning assumption, or decision interpretation. |
| Temporal-aspect borrowing | Positive temporal-aspect content stays in `C.27.TA`; C.27 cites or uses only the temporal-aspect fields needed for this adequacy question. |
| DynOrder | The body distinguishes state reading, rate reading, and intervention-sensitive rate-change, rhythm, or regime reading. |
| Minimal output | The output is the minimal one that changes use: no C.27 record, Dyn0 reading, Dyn1 reading, `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`, or formal-model relation. |
| Card minimum | A `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` names temporal reading or bearer, move, intervention, window, resistance or cost, evidence relation, model assumption, planning assumption, or neighbouring-pattern relation, supported use, unsupported downstream claim, effect, or use, and reopen or pattern-reference condition. |
| Boundary-crossing profile | `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` appears only when the authored temporal claim is used beyond the local working context into benchmark, publication, assurance, promise-like, gate, reusable method, cross-context, cross-scale, or formal or control use. |
| Pattern boundary | C.27 does not carry measurement, transition law, Work actuals, planning, `C.28`-governed causal-use claim, benchmark parity, promise or boundary claim, assurance, or QL residue. |
| Neighboring-pattern-use block | If supported use relies on measurement, causal attribution, benchmark parity, control or policy relation, cross-scale transfer, debt or hysteresis, promise, high-stakes temporal action, or QL residue, name the corresponding pattern reference or present profile block. |
| Profile-block closure | Every present block is defined by C.27, pattern-reference-only, or absent from `activeBlocks`; a block name is not a new EntityOfConcern. |
| Pattern-relation economy | Add a C.27 relation note to another pattern only when that pattern has a concrete boundary reason to inspect temporal-claim adequacy; otherwise a C.27 card or profile cites the applicable FPF pattern for the other question instead of creating a thin duplicate temporal record. |
| Stop or lower | If no downstream claim, effect, or use changes, the claim remains ordinary prose, Dyn0 reading, Dyn1 reading, C.16 measurement, `U.Dynamics`, or the applicable pattern. |

**Value and harm boundary.** A temporally adequate claim is not automatically a
valuable claim. A valuable claim is not automatically temporally adequate. If
value, harm, safety, legal, ethics, quality, or promise impact is FPF-governed,
C.27 states only the temporal action, window, supported use, unsupported
downstream claim, effect, or use, and the pattern relation. Use the applicable
value, harm, safety, legal, ethics, quality, or promise pattern for the other question.

**Conceptual lint classes (informative).** These labels describe cheap
inspection faults, not a required tool.

| Lint | Failure | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `C27-KEYWORD-OVERREACH` | A speed or rhythm word creates a profile without a supported-use change. | Downgrade to ordinary prose, Dyn0, or Dyn1. |
| `C27-MISSING-CARD-MINIMUM` | Dyn2 card lacks temporal reading or bearer, move, intervention, window, resistance or cost, evidence relation, model assumption, planning assumption, neighbouring-pattern relation, supported use, or reopen condition. | Complete the card or downgrade. |
| `C27-PROFILE-WITHOUT-BOUNDARY-USE` | A profile is used for a local note. | Downgrade to a local card. |
| `C27-PATTERN-RELATION-THEFT` | C.27 carries measurement, dynamics-law, work, benchmark, promise, or QL content. | Keep that content with the applicable FPF pattern. |
| `C27-DYNORDER-AS-KIND` | Teams, systems, services, or methods become Dyn2 objects. | Repair to an authored-claim reading. |
| `C27-CAUSAL-LAUNDERING` | Rate changed after effort, therefore effort caused it. | Add `C.28` causal-use relation or mark causal use unsupported. |
| `C27-METRIC-TARGET-CONFLATION` | Metric improved, therefore the system improved. | Split measure, target pressure, work change, proxy distortion, and residual probe cue. |
| `C27-PROMISE-LAUNDERING` | Planning temporal claim becomes SLA, service guarantee, or commitment. | Keep promise, boundary, or service content with the patterns that carry it. |

**Common failure modes after adoption (informative).**

| Failure mode | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| Profile inflation | Every temporal phrase gets a profile; keep profile use for boundary-crossing claim use. |
| Pattern-relation theft | C.27 carries measurement, work, promise, benchmark, or QL; return the other question to the applicable FPF pattern. |
| Card laundering | A local card is cited as `C.28`-governed causal-use claim, benchmark result, release approval, or service promise; mark that use unsupported. |
| DynOrder reification | A team or system becomes "Dyn2"; keep DynOrder as a reading of authored temporal claims. |
| Relation-note inflation | Every nearby pattern gets a C.27 note just in case; add a note only when the pattern must inspect temporal-claim adequacy directly. |

### C.27:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

C.27 starts with the anti-patterns most likely to make a working reader misuse a
state or rate reading as a Dyn2 temporal claim. Less frequent traps belong in the
extended bank and should not become a first-screen checklist.

| Core anti-pattern | What it looks like | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rate -> intervention laundering | "We measured throughput, therefore we know how to accelerate it." | Ask whether the claim is Dyn0 state, Dyn1 rate, or Dyn2 rate-change under effort, resistance, and window; add only the least-committing C.27 record that changes supported use. |
| Effort-free acceleration | “Velocity will double” with no effort, input, claimed intervention applier, exact assignment when relied on, resistance proxy, window, evidence, or supported use. | Add a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` or downgrade to Dyn1 measurement. |
| Past slope as control model | A historical trend is treated as a future intervention law. | Separate observed Dyn1 trend from Dyn2 intervention claim and formal-model relation. |
| C.27 as `C.28`-governed causal-use claim | Rate changed after effort, therefore effort caused it. | Keep it as a planning assumption or diagnostic reading, or include `dyn2CausalUseRelation?` with `causalInterventionSpecRef`, contrast or counterfactual, timing, outcome, assumptions, rival causes, supported causal use and unsupported causal use, and `C.28` causal-use relation. |
| Rhythm as decoration | Rhythm names vibe or cadence with no bearer, timing reference, window, proxy, evidence, or supported use. | Name bearer, timing reference, window, instrument or evidence proxy, and supported use; add coupling, phase, or entrainment only when the claim depends on a cross-bearer relation. |
| Metric-accelerated theater | The measured rate improves after becoming a target while hidden work worsens. | Separate real work-rate change, measurement effect or probe effect, gaming risk, and temporal intervention effect. |
| Aggregate acceleration laundering | Local speed or aggregate speed is laundered across holon levels. | Separate local bearer, aggregate bearer, mix shift, aggregation relation, and `crossScaleTransferUseBoundary`. |
| Acceleration bias | Faster is treated as better by default. | Make braking, pause, stabilization, redirection, coasting, and slower rollout legitimate outcomes. |

Use the negative cases to make non-use easy. They are not profile triggers.

| Negative case | Correct C.27 outcome |
| --- | --- |
| "This section accelerates orientation." | No C.27 record unless the `PublicationUnit` carries that acceleration claim to make a decision, promise, intervention, or comparison claim. |
| "The chart shows throughput rising." | Dyn1; C.16 only if the measurement construction is FPF-governed. No C.27 record unless a rate-change intervention claim appears. |
| "The team has a clear rhythm." | No C.27 record unless rhythm carries a decision-use; then name bearer, timing reference, window, evidence proxy, and supported use. |
| "We use a dashboard of velocity." | C.16, E.13, or C.26.1 when the issue under repair is measurement, proxy distortion, or probe or publication effect; C.27 only when the dashboard is claimed to change a temporal outcome. |
| "The model is dynamic." | `U.Dynamics` when a state-space or transition law is being described; no C.27 record unless authored prose makes a rate-change adequacy claim. |
| "The agent used more calls." | C.24 relation or work-trace relation; C.27 only when more calls are claimed to change debugging, search, learning, recovery, or stabilization rate. |
| "The process is agile." | A.6.P local-head restoration first when "agile" is overloaded; C.27 only when a braking, redirection, or rate-change question is current. |

Use the extended anti-patterns only when the temporal claim actually raises
that trap.

| Extended anti-pattern | What it looks like | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keyword-triggered bureaucracy | Any speed, rhythm, agility, throughput, velocity, accelerate, or slow-down word requires a profile. | Use supported-use relevance, not keyword matching. |
| Derivative label without template | Acceleration, velocity, momentum, or cadence number lacks base characteristic, unit, scale, sampling window, method, and evidence. | Use C.16 measurement construction. |
| Rhythm bearer mismatch | Evidence from one bearer or window is applied to another. | Add bridge or evidence relation or mark transfer unsupported. |
| Effort window hidden in plan prose | Plan says "push harder" without WorkPlan, method, resource envelope, or actual burn evidence relation. | Attach planned effort to planning patterns and actual burn to work patterns. |
| Dynamics law as work log | Work trace or telemetry is treated as the law of change. | Keep `U.Dynamics` separate from `U.Work` evidence. |
| Agility as cornering speed | "Change direction fast" hides braking and redirection cost. | Name braking, redirection cost, intervention constraints, evidence, and supported use. |
| Premature convergence by acceleration | Faster narrowing collapses diversity, novelty, or frontier coverage. | Use C.17, C.18, and C.19 as applicable and distinguish exploitation speed from healthy search. |
| Dyn2 profile as hidden promise | A planning note becomes a service guarantee, SLA-like statement, or public commitment. | Separate planning assumption or planning-model relation from promise content and boundary obligation. |
| Noisy acceleration worship | Small variation is overread as meaningful rate-change. | Widen sampling, add uncertainty, downgrade, or collect higher-quality or more directly relevant evidence. |
| Tool-call acceleration theater | More calls or more context are treated as faster reasoning. | Name the rate-change under concern and stop or replan trigger. |
| Harmful acceleration | Work is accelerated while safety, ethics, legality, operations-service demand, or human wellbeing becomes worse. | Use pattern-reference-only `dyn2HighStakesTemporalActionRelation?` to name the high-stakes temporal action, window, and unsupported use and cite the applicable assurance, ethics, legal, safety, quality, or wellbeing pattern. |
| Coasting claim without evidence or assumption | Continued motion after effort stops is treated as free evidence of success. | Name coasting evidence or assumption: habit, automation, stored work, learned capability, social norm, commitment momentum, physical inertia, queue pressure, or unknown. |
| Reversibility fantasy | Effort is removed and the system is assumed to return cleanly. | Include `dyn2DebtHysteresisBlock?` only when supported use depends on residue or reversibility; record `unknown` if needed and bound supported use, with brake or recovery relation when FPF-governed. |

### C.27:9 - Consequences

C.27 should make FPF better at planning and reviewing dynamic
claims while keeping ordinary state and rate claims cheap. Its main cost is one
more C-pattern and several neighbour notes in existing FPF patterns. The mitigation is the
central affordability rule: C.27 must be easier not to use than to misuse.

C.27 claims decay over time. Refresh or reopen when one of the listed conditions changes.

Refresh demand stays proportional:
```text
Local C.27 card:
  has reopenTrigger only.

Boundary-crossing C.27 profile:
  has validityWindowRef and evidence valid_until when FPF-governed.

Part G, benchmark, SoTA, or public method claim:
  C.27 reopenTrigger feeds G.11 refresh orchestration;
  C.27 does not become a refresh ledger.
```

- sampling window, cadence, or time base changes;
- effort envelope or resource budget changes;
- claimed intervention applier, exact system-role-assignment availability, performer eligibility, independently obtaining authority, or holder availability changes;
- inertia or resistance proxy changes: new tooling, team, queue topology, domain,
  work mix, constraints, or service environment;
- metric becomes a target, incentive, gate, dashboard, or public comparison;
- cross-scale transfer is attempted;
- outcome reverses, overshoots, oscillates, or becomes unstable;
- hidden queues, rework, burnout, quality loss, operations-service demand, safety demand, or
  coordination debt appear;
- rhythm bearer, timing reference, window, proxy, or coupling changes;
- claim use changes from assumption or diagnostic to benchmark, assurance,
  causal, promise-like, publication, or formal model use;
- the claim is reused outside its original validity window or domain;
- a coasting, braking, or recovery claim continues after effort changes or stops.

Local `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`s normally need only a reopen, downgrade,
or pattern-reference condition. `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`s for boundary-crossing claim use should cite
`validityWindowRef` or evidence `valid_until` when the claim carries a
benchmark, gate, assurance, promise-like use, reusable method, publication, or
formal-model relation. If rate-change evidence decays, freshness and epistemic-debt
handling belongs with B.3.4 or G.11 rather than becoming a C.27 freshness calculus.

When a Dyn2 benchmark, task-family adaptation claim, public method claim,
selector-facing claim, SoTA publication claim, or other Part G publication carries a
temporal-claim record, C.27 `reopenTrigger` is not enough by itself. C.27 states
the temporal-claim question and its validity or reopen condition; G.9 carries benchmark parity
when comparison is being made; G.11 carries refresh orchestration such as refresh
queue, refresh plan, refresh report, deprecation notice, or edition bump when
evidence, comparator editions, method editions, claim windows, or validity
windows drift.

### C.27:10 - Rationale

The source material is most relevant where it replaces
the question "what is the speed?" with "what effort profile, over which windows,
changes speed, rhythm, direction, or stability under resistance and cost?" The
C.27 keeps that practical move while rejecting physics ontology,
mandatory calculus, false QL relevance, and default full-profile
bureaucracy.

C.27 acts in FPF as a small modern correction for one recurring failure:
working texts observe or name a rate and then behave as if they know how to
change that rate. The pattern brings FPF up to modern practice only in the
following shape:

- the state, rate, and rate-change distinction remains the cheap recognition gain;
- control, policy evaluation, causal inference, process mining, benchmarking,
  rhythm, and high-stakes temporal-move cases appear as present profile blocks;
- quantum-like residual cases appear only as C.26 relations, not as C.27 claim-adequacy content
  blocks or fields of one universal dynamic EntityOfConcern;
- control fields stay absent by default and appear only for control-style use;
- behavior-policy versus evaluation-policy discipline is visible when
  off-policy or sequential-policy transfer is claimed;
- causal claims carry intervention contrast, time zero, follow-up, outcome,
  assumptions, and identification or evaluation relation rather than C.27 shorthand;
- performative and Goodhart cases separate metric-as-measure,
  metric-as-target, and metric-as-intervention;
- work-cycle and process-rate claims name bearer, object trace, event trace, interaction, and
  convergence or divergence rather than one generic process-speed label;
- dynamic benchmarks use C.27 to type the temporal-claim question while G.9 carries
  parity;
- rhythm claims stay bearer plus timing reference plus window plus evidence proxy relation plus supported use by default, with
  entrainment or coupling claims with cross-bearer evidence commitments only when the claim needs them;
- quantum-like use stays out of C.27 unless a residual probe, order, frame, or export
  cue remains after ordinary C.27, C.24, C.16, G.9, and E.13 pattern relations;
- full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`s remain rare, and the pattern improves action quality more than
  it increases paperwork.

One-line SoTA formulation for C.27: it makes
intervention-sensitive temporal claims explicit - policy, effort, window,
resistance, feedback, evidence, bearer, and supported use - while refusing to
treat every speed or rhythm phrase as control theory, `C.28`-governed causal-use claim, benchmark
superiority, or quantum-like modeling.

### C.27:11 - SoTA-Echoing

C.27 should be shaped by current modeling practice without becoming a survey
paper. The C.27 SoTA claim is: C.27 is intervention-sensitive temporal
claim adequacy with explicit evidence relation and temporal-claim-use classification, not literal second
derivative everywhere and not universal control theory.

Source binding used by this section:

| Source line | C.27 use | Source-use disposition for C.27 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `D2-SRC-1` - the source article on state, first-derivative dynamics, second-derivative dynamics, effort intervals, and rhythm practice. | Sets the working question: are we only reading speed or rhythm, or claiming that effort over time changes speed or rhythm? | Adopt the question shift and dance and practice usability examples; adapt physical vocabulary into authored temporal-claim adequacy; reject new Kernel `force`, `mass`, `acceleration`, or `rhythm` kinds. |
| `D2-SRC-2` - learning-based MPC and engineering MPC practice. | Disciplines control-style temporal claims with horizon, constraints, uncertainty, feedback update, and stability only when a control-style claim is being made. | Adapt into optional `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?`; reject making every Dyn2 card a control model. |
| `D2-SRC-3` - safe RL, off-policy evaluation, conservative offline RL, and dynamic treatment-regime practice. | Disciplines policy or regime transfer, policy-overlap, unsafe exploration, behavior policy, evaluation policy, and repeated intervention timing. | Adapt into `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` when a policy or regime claim is being made; reject policy-transfer evidence relation from one observed slope alone. |
| `D2-SRC-4` - causal inference for intervention effects. | Separates planning or diagnostic Dyn2 claims from causal effect claims. | Adopt causal question, comparator or counterfactual, estimand, timing, outcome, assumptions, rival causes, and evidence-design discipline for `dyn2CausalUseRelation?`; reject `C.28` causal-use claim completion inside C.27 itself. |
| `D2-SRC-5` - performative prediction and Goodhart variants. | Shows that metric publication, target use, incentives, or gates may change behavior rather than merely report it. | Adapt into `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?`; C.16 carries measurement, E.13 or an assurance pattern carries proxy distortion, and C.26 carries residual probe, frame, or export cues; reject a generic Goodhart catch-all. |
| `D2-SRC-6` - object-centric process mining and object-centric event logs. | Shows why scalar throughput often hides multiple object bearers, event traces, interactions, and aggregation risks. | Adapt into `dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?` and object-centric trace requirements; reject one scalar rate as whole work-cycle truth when multi-object interaction matters to the claim. |
| `D2-SRC-7` - active inference and active sensing practice. | Reminds C.27 that measurement can be action, while ordinary FPF pattern relations remain primary. | Adapt as a local relation test for measurement, state-space, planning, evidence, control, causal, or process-log relation; reject automatic QL relevance from planned measurement or typed states. |
| `D2-SRC-8` - rhythm, beat synchronization, groove, entrainment, and compliant-system timing work. | Disciplines rhythm claims with bearer, timing reference, window, proxy relation, evidence relation, and supported use; coupling, phase, or entrainment appear only for cross-bearer claims with explicit coupling, phase, or entrainment commitments. | Adapt into rhythm fields on `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; reject a standalone `U.Rhythm` kind or decorative rhythm vocabulary. |
| `CT-TIME-SRC` - constructor theory of time. | Separates task or bounded transformation from duration, timer and clock relations, and dynamics; a temporal claim can be about a transformation without becoming the transformation itself. | Adopt as a boundary row only: `A.3.4` carries bounded transformation, `C.27.TA` carries positive temporal aspect, `A.3.3` carries dynamics episteme, and C.27 judges the authored temporal claim's adequacy for use. |

Currentness source set: as of June 2026, newer safe-learning MPC and safe-continual-RL work reinforces the existing fields rather than changing the C.27 ontology. Reopen this source use when current control, policy-evaluation, dynamic-treatment-regime, benchmark, or rhythm practice changes the required horizon, constraint, uncertainty, feedback-update, policy-overlap, nonstationarity, safety-boundary, bearer, timing-reference, evidence, or supported-use obligations.

SoTA lesson to C.27 obligation map:

| Modern lesson | C.27 obligation | Applicable pattern for the other question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MPC and control practice separates horizon, constraints, uncertainty, and feedback update. | Name control horizon and update only when the temporal claim is control-style. | `A.3.3 U.Dynamics`, C.16, C.19, C.24, evidence, and assurance patterns. |
| OPE and safe RL separates behavior policy, evaluation policy, policy overlap, and unsafe-exploration risk. | Do not transfer evidence from policy A to policy B without behavior-policy, evaluation-policy, and `offPolicyRisk`. | `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` plus evaluation or control relations. |
| Causal inference separates intervention timing, comparator or counterfactual, estimand, follow-up, assumptions, and rival causes. | Keep planning or diagnostic Dyn2 distinct from `C.28`-governed causal-use claim. | `C.28` and evidence patterns. |
| Performative prediction and Goodhart variants show that published targets can change behavior. | Split metric-as-measure, target or incentive use, temporal intervention, and proxy distortion. | C.16, E.13 or an assurance pattern, C.26 only for residual probe or frame cue. |
| Object-centric process mining shows scalar throughput can hide multi-object interaction. | Recover object types, event trace, interaction note, and aggregation relation when process speed is FPF-governed. | Local process evidence and OCPM discipline plus C.27 object-centric trace block. |
| Rhythm research treats rhythm as bearer, timing reference, window, proxy, and coupling when claimed. | Keep cadence or rhythm claims tied to bearer, timing reference, evidence, supported use, and optional coupling only when cross-bearer relation matters. | C.27 rhythm card plus C.16 or evidence relation when measured. |
| Constructor theory of time separates task or bounded transformation from duration, timer and clock relations, and dynamics. | Do not let a temporal claim supply the transformation ontology or dynamics model. Use `A.3.4` for bounded transformation, `C.27.TA` for temporal aspect, and `A.3.3` for transition-law semantics; keep C.27 to adequacy-for-use of the authored temporal claim. | `A.3.4`, `C.27.TA`, and `A.3.3`. |
| Scaling-law practice separates scale variable, scale window, probe, and elasticity. | Do not infer linear improvement from more data, tokens, calls, reviewers, or capacity. | C.18.1 and G.9 when compared. |
| Benchmark practice needs parity pins, baselines, freshness, budgets, and comparator editions. | Do not read faster improvement as benchmark superiority without parity plan or report. | G.9. |

Control and MPC. Control-style claims need horizon, constraints, uncertainty,
feedback update, and stability only when a control-style claim is being made. A local
`Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` can say "we plan to brake rollout for two weeks to protect operations-service capacity" without becoming MPC. If the claim is not control-style, do not fill
control fields. A control claim used beyond the local working context needs the neighbouring pattern relation for that use.
C.27 control or policy relation: `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` is present only when
`dynClaimUseClass` is `controlModel`, `policyRule`, `adaptive`, a `planningModel` with feedback relation, or an explicit C.24, C.19, or evaluation relation. The block says that
the temporal claim has crossed into control claim-use or policy claim-use; it does not make
C.27 an MPC, reinforcement-learning, or policy-evaluation pattern.

Sequential decision and reinforcement-learning practice. Many real rate-change
claims are policy or regime claims, not one-shot effort claims. Policy-transfer
control details and policy details belong inside `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?`, not in the default
`Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`. When it applies, the block should recover behavior policy, evaluation policy,
overlap note, uncertainty or bound reference, unsafe-exploration note,
and pattern reference to C.19, C.24, `U.Dynamics`, or the evaluation pattern. This matters for
adaptive rollouts, agentic tool-use, clinical-like treatment regimes, and
repeated operational interventions.

Causal inference. C.27 is not a `C.28` causal-use claim pattern. Effort plus observed rate-change may
carry a planning or diagnostic reading, but a causal attribution needs a separate
`C.28` causal-use relation. When `dyn2CausalUseRelation?` is present, it should name the causal question,
intervention reference, comparator or counterfactual, estimand, time-zero or
assignment window, follow-up window, outcome measure, assumptions, rival causes,
identification strategy or evidence design when available, supported causal use,
and unsupported causal use.

Core rule: C.27 can say a claim is Dyn2 and intervention-sensitive. C.27 cannot
turn that temporal relation into a `C.28`-governed causal-use claim with estimand, identification, realizability, evidence design, and supported-use judgment. Dyn2 can describe an intervention-sensitive
temporal-claim question; it does not estimate causal effect unless `dyn2CausalUseRelation?`
is active and `C.28` causal-use discipline carries the causal question.

Metric publication and target use. When a metric becomes a target, dashboard, incentive, gate, or public comparison, it may change temporal behavior. C.27 uses `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` only for the temporal intervention and supported-use change. C.16 carries metric-as-measure, `E.13` or an assurance pattern carries target, proxy, utility-distortion, or optimization-target adequacy, and C.26 appears only for residual probe, frame, order, or export cues after ordinary C.27, C.16, and `E.13` pattern relations are named. This keeps Goodhart from becoming a C.27 mini-pattern.

Process mining and object-centric process mining. Scalar throughput is often a
thin view. Some dynamic claims need trace topology, multiple object bearers,
interaction notes, and evidence about how queues, tickets, incidents, customers,
orders, services, engineers, deployments, or review windows interact. When this question is current, `C.27:4 - Solution` defines the
`dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?` fields. This section explains why multi-object
trace requirements should be named instead of pretending that one scalar
throughput rate says enough.

Active sensing and active inference. Measurement may be an action rather than a
passive read, but that is still usually ordinary FPF pattern relations: measurement,
state-space, planning, evidence, control, causal, or process-log relation. QL is
not made relevant by typing, discreteness, state reduction, tokenization, or planned
measurement. C.27 may notice dynamic or probe pressure, but it must not promote
active inference, quantum cognition, or QL mathematics unless C.26 remains
relevant after ordinary-pattern non-use tests.

Rhythm and embodied dynamics. Rhythm claims used beyond ordinary local prose need bearer, timing reference,
window, evidence proxy relation, and supported use. Coupling, phase relation, entrainment-like
relation, perturbation response, tempo drift, or synchronization evidence are
downstream claim, effect, or use fields only when the claim depends on coordination between bearers.
This preserves the useful dance and practice analogy without minting a rhythm
ontology.

C.27 is a middle recognition-and-relation lens, not a general dynamic-theory
pattern. It notices when a claim has moved from state or rate reading to
intervention-sensitive temporal adequacy, then keeps higher-demand claim relations with
the existing FPF pattern that carries them:

| Claim question noticed by C.27 | Existing FPF pattern relation |
| --- | --- |
| measurement or comparable rate or rate-change reading | `C.16` |
| transition law, reusable dynamics model, prediction, simulation, or control model | `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` plus evidence and assurance patterns |
| actual work trace, effort trace, or resource burn | `U.Work` or `Gamma_work` |
| scale-variable or elasticity claim | `C.18.1` scaling-law lens |
| search policy, exploration and exploitation, premature narrowing, convergence health | `C.19` |
| agentic tool-use planning or tool-call rate-change | `C.24` call-planning discipline |
| task-family learning or adaptation speed or time-to-usable specialization | `C.22.1` task-family adaptation signature |
| viability-envelope temporal regulation | `C.26.3` viability-envelope boundary regulation |
| reproducible dynamic benchmark or faster-improvement comparison | `G.9` |
| causal-use claim or effect estimate | `C.28` and evidence patterns |
| promise, SLA or SLO, gate, public commitment, release claim | promise, boundary, service, and assurance patterns |
| residual probe, frame, export, coarsening, or order-effect cue | `C.26` |

The following lines connect common failures to C.27 action, not to a literature catalog:

| Popular failure | Modern correction | C.27 action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Past slope is treated as a future control law. | Control or policy claims need horizon, update rule, constraints, and evidence or model relation. | If local, make a `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; if reusable or control use is being made, include `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` and cite `U.Dynamics`, C.16, and assurance patterns for the other questions. |
| Data from one policy or regime is used to justify another. | OPE and RL practice asks behavior policy, evaluation policy, policy-overlap, uncertainty, and unsafe-exploration risk. | Keep ordinary `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` cheap; include `dyn2ControlPolicyRelation?` only when policy transfer is FPF-governed. |
| One effort impulse is treated as the whole dynamic regime. | Dynamic-treatment-regime practice treats some interventions as sequences of decision rules. | Record policy or regime only in active block; do not make every Dyn2 a policy model. |
| Rate changed after effort, so effort caused it. | Causal inference needs contrast or counterfactual, estimand, timing, outcome, assumptions, rival causes, and design. | Keep it as a planning assumption or diagnostic reading, or include `dyn2CausalUseRelation?`; `C.28` causal-use discipline carries the causal-use claim. |
| Metric improves after publication, so process improved. | Performative or Goodhart cases split measurement, target use, incentive use, proxy distortion, temporal intervention, and residual probe, frame, or export effects. | Include `dyn2MetricTargetEffectBlock?` only for temporal intervention and supported-use change; C.16 carries measurement, E.13 or an assurance pattern carries proxy distortion, and C.26 carries residual probe, frame, or export cue. |
| Scalar throughput is read as whole work-cycle truth. | OCPM and process mining separate object bearers, event traces, interactions, and aggregation. | Include `dyn2ObjectCentricTraceBlock?` or `dyn2CrossScaleTransferBlock?` only when scalar rate is insufficient. |
| Measurement-as-action triggers QL too early. | Active sensing may matter, but ordinary FPF pattern relations come first. | Keep C.27 ordinary; treat QL as C.26 content only after ordinary-pattern non-use tests. |
| Rhythm is decorative cadence or vibe. | Rhythm work needs bearer, timing reference, window, evidence proxy, and supported use; coupling belongs only in downstream claim, effect, or use fields. | Use `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; include coupling, phase, or entrainment only when the claim depends on cross-bearer relation. |

### C.27:12 - Relations

C.27 is the pattern for authored temporal-claim adequacy. It asks whether a
claim about speed, rhythm, throughput, recovery, convergence, rollout, adoption,
braking, coasting, redirection, or stabilization is sufficiently supported for the use
being made of it. It does not become the pattern for the described system, work,
measurement, benchmark, promise, quality bundle, or formal dynamics model.

When a temporal claim also touches another FPF concern, use the FPF pattern that
applies to that concern and let C.27 state only the temporal-claim adequacy question.

| Related FPF pattern or discipline | Use C.27 for | Keep in that pattern or discipline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C.27 itself | First-use entry and stop rule; Dyn0, Dyn1, and Dyn2 distinction; least-demand supported output sequence; `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`; `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` for boundary-crossing claim use; anti-patterns; refresh and reopen triggers. | Nothing outside C.27 is needed when the claim remains only a local temporal-claim adequacy question. |
| `C.27.TA` | Naming the positive temporal aspect that the authored temporal claim uses: time window, duration, freshness, currentness, validity window, cadence, rhythm, synchronization, recovery timing, stabilization timing, effort over time, inertia, or refresh condition. | Temporal aspect bearer, timing reference, window or interval, and neighboring-use relation. C.27 judges claim adequacy; C.27.TA names the temporal aspect. |
| `C.16.P` and `C.16` | Use `C.16.P` when rate, measure, metric, score, proxy, or base-characteristic wording is not yet recoverable; use `C.16` when the measurement relation is already explicit and the temporal question remains current. | Characteristic, scale, score, unit, comparability, measurement construction, evidence, sampling window, and supported metric use. C.27 only names the temporal-claim adequacy question. |
| `C.26` | Keeping ordinary dynamics, measurement, work-effort, rhythm, braking, coasting, and intervention-timing questions outside QL before any residual QL cue is considered. | Residual probe, frame, order, export, or coarsening cue after ordinary C.27, C.16, work, benchmark, and proxy pattern relations. |
| `A.3.3 U.Dynamics` | Deciding that an authored temporal claim is being used with enough commitment to need a reusable transition-law, simulation, prediction, formal model, or calibrated control relation. | State space, transition law, observation or model constraints, validity discipline, simulation, prediction, and calibrated control model semantics. |
| `A.3.4 U.Transformation` | Naming that the authored temporal claim is about a bounded transformation whose before-and-after state or delta, transformation relation, boundary condition, and neighboring relation references must be identified. | The transformed object, bounded context, `TransformationCore`, transformation slot relation, and non-temporal neighboring values. C.27 only judges the authored temporal claim's adequacy for use. |
| `A.19` and `C.16` together | Showing that derivative-like wording needs base characteristic, scale or unit, time base or sampling window, construction method, evidence, and supported use. | Characteristic-space construction discipline and measurement construction. C.27 does not create a parallel coordinate system. |
| `C.29` | Naming temporal-claim adequacy when a mathematical-lens use is being expressed through forecast, rate, trajectory, rhythm, recovery, convergence, stabilization, speed, temporal window, or rate-change wording. `C.27.TA` names the positive temporal aspect; C.27 states whether the authored temporal claim can carry the practical use. | Mathematical-lens use: formal substrate, preserved structure, lost structure, payoff, and validation boundary for prediction, distinction, obstruction, or diagnostic boundary. Formal transition-law, prediction, or control-model semantics stay with `A.3.3` plus evidence and assurance loci when those uses are being made. |
| `B.1.4` and `B.1.6` | Preventing temporal slices, phase names, work logs, resource burn, or effort traces from being read as acceleration or transition laws. | Temporal-slice composition, phase composition, work and resource aggregation, and actual work evidence. |
| `B.1.5` and `B.2.4` | Naming the temporal-claim adequacy question only when method composition, work enactment, adaptive work cycle, or capability-emergence prose also claims faster or slower improvement, recovery, stabilization, braking, or rhythm change. | Order-sensitive method composition, work enactment, adaptive work cycle, and meta-functional transition. C.27 does not become a method-composition or emergence pattern. |
| `A.4`, `B.4`, `A.16`, and `B.4.1` | Naming a temporal-claim adequacy question inside state-change, evolution-loop, cue-stabilization, reopen, operationalize, retire, or language-state movement prose. | Temporal duality, canonical evolution loops, language-state move legality, and observe-notice-stabilize relation discipline. C.27 does not become a life-cycle time scale or language-state movement pattern. |
| `C.24` | Tool-use plans whose tool-call sequence is claimed to change debugging speed, repair rate, learning rate, candidate discovery, evidence confirmation, bug localization, rollout stabilization, or uncertainty reduction. | Call planning, tool-use sequence, and work trace. More calls or more context are not dynamic improvement by themselves. |
| `C.17` and `C.18` | Naming the temporal-claim adequacy question only when a creativity, novelty, open-ended search, archive-growth, illumination, or candidate-generation claim also claims faster or slower improvement, coverage, discovery, or convergence. | Creativity characteristics, novelty and value measurement, NQD generation, update, illumination, and select-front calculus, archive semantics, and provenance pins. |

Use pattern references before expanding a C.27 record. When measurement,
transition law, work evidence, planning, benchmark parity, `C.28` causal-use
claim, promise content, assurance claim, quality, viability, or residual QL
discipline applies to the other question, the C.27 record cites the corresponding pattern and
keeps only the temporal-claim adequacy question.

When a temporal claim touches neighbouring work, keep these boundaries:

1. Fields in a C.27 card do not imply new Kernel kinds.
2. State space, measurement, transition law, work, planning, benchmark, causality, promise, service, quality-bundle, publication, transformation, and QL questions stay with their applicable FPF patterns.
3. The described object, authored temporal claim, temporal bearer, profile content, and profile carrier remain distinct.
4. If the text says process, work cycle, practice, service, method, system, transformation, or rhythm, the real bearer or changed object is named through a named FPF kind and reference rather than treated as one generic moving thing.
5. Derivative-like readings remain compatible with C.16 measurement construction.
6. Full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`s remain rare and justified rather than default.
7. At least one golden case stops or downgrades from Dyn2 correctly.
8. Braking, pause, stabilization, redirection, and coasting are first-class temporal moves rather than failures to accelerate.
9. QL relevance stays inactive unless ordinary pattern relations leave residual probe, frame, export, or coarsening cue.
10. Causal, benchmark, promise-like, transformation, and assurance claims cite the applicable pattern relation rather than relying on an ordinary `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`.

This is the neighbouring-question boundary check, not a second relation matrix and not a form for ordinary use. Before expanding C.27, ask four questions:

1. Is the EntityOfConcern still the authored temporal claim, with the described object, claim-bearing description, and carrier kept separate under A.7/C.2.1? If not, return to the applicable pattern for the described object or episteme.
2. Is local dynamic wording (`Dyn2`, rhythm, force, inertia, speed, acceleration, trend, rate-change) turning into a new FPF kind or a hidden coordinate system? If yes, use E.10/F.18 and the applicable characteristic or measurement patterns before writing more C.27 apparatus.
3. Is the current question actually measurement, dynamics, work, work planning, causality, benchmark parity, promise, service acceptance, quality, viability, evidence, provenance, QL residue, or transformation? If yes, use the applicable pattern named in the relation table and keep only the temporal-claim adequacy question here.
4. Is the local one-screen `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard` enough? If yes, do not open a `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` and do not copy neighboring-pattern doctrine into C.27.

At use time, the concrete relation is enough: name the temporal-claim adequacy question, name the applicable pattern for the other question, state the unsupported downstream claim, effect, or use, and choose the minimal C.27 output or the pattern relation that carries the other claim.

Core discipline: C.27 does not name new objects in the world. It names when an authored temporal claim has started to need intervention-sensitive temporal adequacy, then keeps each higher-demand claim relation with the applicable FPF pattern for that concern.

Practitioner-readable problem:

> A trend is not yet an intervention model. Use C.27 when a claim about speed,
> rhythm, throughput, recovery, convergence, rollout, or adoption is used to
> change action and therefore needs effort, window, resistance, evidence relation or assumption relation, and
> reopen discipline.

One-minute working script:

> When a text says something should get faster, slower, recover, stabilize, or
> keep rhythm, first ask: are we only reading a state, only reading a rate, or
> claiming that an intervention changes the rate, rhythm, recovery, or
> stabilization? If it is only state or rate, stop. If it is an intervention
> claim, write the smallest `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`: what changes, by
> what effort, in what window, against what resistance or cost, with what evidence relation or assumption relation,
> for what supported use, and what downstream claim, effect, or use is not carried by the temporal-claim record. Only boundary-crossing
> claims need a `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`. Formal laws, measurements, work,
> `C.28` causal-use claim, benchmarks, promises, assurance, viability envelopes,
> scale-variable claims, adaptation signatures, and QL residues stay with the
> existing FPF patterns for those concerns.

C.27 also carries an early non-improvement boundary:

> C.27 is not a temporal theory of everything.
> It is the smallest useful repair for one recurring authored-claim failure:
> rate talk pretending to know rate-change.

C.27 does not present itself as improving all temporal reasoning, all
process modeling, all practice description, all rhythm theory, all
control, RL, causal inference, all performance management, all QL or
active-inference modeling, all scaling claims, or all adaptation claims. It
improves one narrow working failure: it prevents state or rate readings from being
laundered into intervention-sensitive temporal claims without effort, window,
resistance, evidence or assumption relation, and `supportedUse` and `unsupportedUse` field discipline.

The first C.27 record should be the one-screen `Dyn2TemporalClaimAdequacyCard`, not a full `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile`.
The `Dyn2TemporalClaimProfile` is a boundary-crossing claim-use C.27 record. Existing formal patterns carry formal models; a C.27 record cites them when the other question is current instead of copying C.27 theory into another pattern relation.

The durable bottom line is:

> C.27 is useful when it notices state or rate readings being laundered into rate-change claims, produces the least-committing supported next output, and keeps every higher-demand claim relation with the applicable FPF pattern for that concern.

It should help FPF users act more carefully with speed, rhythm, effort,
inertia, braking, coasting, and redirection claims. It does not make FPF carry
mathematical theater, physics ontology, false QL relevance, or unassigned
compliance claims.
