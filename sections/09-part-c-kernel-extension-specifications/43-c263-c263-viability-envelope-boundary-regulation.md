## C.26.3 - Viability-Envelope Boundary Regulation

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### C.26.3:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when architecture work is maintaining, recovering, or changing viable operating ranges across boundaries. The working problem is not "optimize one metric"; it is "keep a bundle of characteristics inside a viable region while disturbances, probes, candidate interventions, boundary conditions, and operating regimes change."

**What goes wrong if missed.** The team treats one dashboard value, stability slogan, or local metric as viability, while another envelope variable, intervention cost, boundary condition, or failure mode is already breaking the protected promise or function.

**What this buys.** The viability claim becomes an inspectable envelope-regulation decision: the exact object filling the local viability-bearer position and the pattern used to identify it, protected promise or function, variables, disturbances, sensors or probes, candidate interventions, boundary condition, adaptation cost, and failure mode are all named before acting.

Most envelope work covered by this pattern is ordinary control, quality, SRE, causal, or work discipline, not QL. FEP, allostasis, and active inference are source analogies for envelope discipline, sensor and action coupling, and partial observability; ordinary control, SRE, quality-bundle, causal, and work patterns remain primary unless probe, order, export, or coarsening cue remains load-bearing after ordinary viability, quality, dynamics, measurement, boundary, and work patterns have carried their part.

| Working card | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary reader | Architect, platform lead, reliability lead, product manager, or operations lead preserving viability under changing conditions. |
| Primary EntityOfConcern | A viability-envelope claim or plan about one exact object already identified under its subject pattern, with the protected promise/function named separately. |
| Admissible move | Point the local viability-bearer position to that exact object and record the pattern used to identify it; then name envelope variables, disturbance, sensors/probes, candidate interventions, boundary condition, adaptation cost, and failure mode. |
| Outside work | One-metric quality tuning, generic control theory, biological proof, full FEP doctrine, and ordinary feedback without an envelope/boundary claim. |
| What changes in practice | The team stops treating one dashboard value as viability and designs the actual envelope-regulation move. |

Plain glosses:
- `viability bearer`: a local lens position, not a kind or relation. It points to one exact object already identified through the pattern for that object. A system reading requires A.1; a selected configuration of system-role kinds and assignments or another structure requires the pattern for its exact relation or structure; a population or market slice requires a declared domain and effective reference scheme, membership or scope, and identity basis. If none is available, stop.
- `protected promise / function`: the separately governed `U.PromiseContent`, stakeholder-value claim, function claim, operating-regime claim, commitment payload, or delivery promise whose continued satisfaction or realization the regulation decision is meant to protect. It is not a slot or part of the object in the local viability-bearer position.
- `service` or market wording: the wording does not itself identify the object in the viability-bearer position. Recover one exact object under the identity rule stated in its pattern, using the system, selected system-role configuration or other structure, or population or market-slice conditions above as applicable; keep promise content, access points, assignments, commitments, Work occurrences, evidence, and direct relations as separately governed claims. If no exact object can be identified, stop; do not turn the phrase into a bearer kind, situation kind, or bundle.
- `viability envelope`: the region of declared characteristic values within which the exact object remains inside the viability bounds stated for the current protected claim or use.
- `envelope variable`: one characteristic that must stay within bounds, such as latency, reliability, support load, compliance exposure, safety margin, energy, or operator attention.
- `actuator` / `candidate intervention`: *actuator* is a control-theory or source label, not an FPF kind and not a synonym for Work. Use *candidate intervention* only as a local prompt until its proposal-side object is recovered: a Method; a `U.MethodDescription` or policy episteme; a proposed setting change; a `U.WorkPlan`; an access or permission claim; or a Bridge proposal or description. Separately identify any dated `U.Work`, independently grounded `U.Transformation`, obtaining relation occurrence, or resulting state claimed to exist. Keep these objects distinct.
- `allostasis`: preserving function through separately governed changes to settings, environment relations, boundary conditions, or operating regime when circumstances change.

### C.26.3:2 - Problem

Teams often collapse viability into one dashboard value or fixed target. They optimize latency and damage operator load. They improve availability and increase compliance exposure. They preserve one metric while exhausting the team, hiding risk, or making recovery slower.

A second failure is passive sensing. A metric, probe, dashboard, alert, or health check is treated as a neutral window into viability, even when its use or publication changes behavior through separately grounded Work, interaction, or governance, or hides unmeasured dimensions.

A third failure is static stability. Teams say "keep the system stable" as if stability always means holding one internal variable fixed. In real architecture work, preserving viability may require a candidate intervention. Recover whether the proposal concerns a Method or description, setting proposal, WorkPlan, access or permission claim, or Bridge proposal or description. Separately identify any dated Work, actual change, obtaining relation occurrence, or resulting state claimed to exist; words such as caching, staffing, routing, protocol, and measurement design do not choose among them.

### C.26.3:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Bundle vs scalar | Viability usually concerns a bundle, but dashboards often expose one or two proxies. |
| Stability vs change | The system may preserve function by changing internal settings, external environment, boundary conditions, or operating regime. |
| Sensing vs intervention | A measurement value is not a change or Work. Its use may report, probe, or participate in a separately grounded behavior-changing Work, interaction, or governance claim. |
| Ordinary control vs QL lens | `C.25`, `U.Dynamics`, `A.6`, `A.15`, and `C.16` remain primary patterns; QL enters only for probe, frame, export, or coarsening cue. |
| Light use vs dynamics detail | Rate, inertia, damping, latency, and effort of the recovered intervention object or resulting change matter only when load-bearing. |

### C.26.3:4 - Solution

Use `C.25` / `U.Dynamics` alone for ordinary envelope work. Use C.26.3 only when the viability-envelope reading is distorted or constrained by probe, frame, export, coarsening, or incompatible representation cue. Otherwise use ordinary viability, quality-bundle, dynamics, measurement, boundary, and work patterns.

Start with this recognition note:

| Mini-entry | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Viability bearer | Which exact object fills this local lens position, and which identity rule, relation, or selected structure establishes it? If it is a system, where is the A.1 basis; if a selected configuration of system-role kinds and assignments or another structure, which exact relation or structure selects it; if a population or market slice, what declares its domain and effective reference scheme, membership or scope, and identity basis? |
| Protected promise / function | Which `U.PromiseContent`, stakeholder value, function, operating regime, commitment payload, or delivery promise is protected? |
| Envelope variables | Which two to five variables matter, rather than one comfort scalar? |
| Disturbance | What pushes the exact object in the local viability-bearer position outside the declared envelope? |
| Sensor / probe / candidate intervention | What reads the situation? What change is proposed, which exact object carries that proposal, and what actual Work, transformation, relation, or resulting state exists, if any? |
| Trade-off / failure | What gets worse, what cost is paid, and what failure would show the envelope move did not work? |

Use the fuller envelope-regulation record below when the viability reading will change a metric, candidate-intervention choice, boundary, staffing, routing, promise, or evidence decision.

Full envelope-regulation record:

| Field | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Viability bearer | Which exact object fills this local lens position, and which identity rule, relation, or selected structure establishes it? If it is a system, where is the A.1 basis; if a selected configuration of system-role kinds and assignments or another structure, which exact relation or structure selects it; if a population or market slice, what declares its domain and effective reference scheme, membership or scope, and identity basis? |
| Protected promise / function | Which `U.PromiseContent`, stakeholder value, function, operating regime, commitment payload, or delivery promise is protected? |
| Current service/access claims, if any | Which independently governed service/access claims are current, and what exact subjects, relations, and subject patterns do they name? |
| Envelope variables | Which characteristics or quality-bundle dimensions define viability? |
| Viable region / bounds | What counts as inside, near edge, degraded, or outside the envelope for this use? |
| QL cue or formal cue if retained | Which probe, order, export, coarsening, incompatible-frame, open-information-system update law, probe-frame relation, export admissibility, or measurement-changing-state cue remains after ordinary viability patterns are active? |
| Disturbance | What pushes the exact object in the local viability-bearer position outside the declared envelope? |
| Sensors / probes | Which metric, dashboard, alert, health check, review, trace query, observation setup, or probe reads the envelope, and can it change behavior or hide unmeasured dimensions? |
| Candidate intervention and recovered direct object | What change is proposed? Recover whether the proposal concerns a Method or description, setting proposal, `U.WorkPlan`, access or permission claim, or Bridge proposal or description. Separately identify any dated `U.Work`, independently grounded `U.Transformation` or other actual change, obtaining relation occurrence, or resulting state already claimed to exist. Which exact objects are current, and under which subject patterns? |
| Boundary condition preserved / changed | Which access, ownership, context, interface, promise, or environment condition matters? |
| Trade-off condition | Which envelope dimension is protected, relaxed, delayed, made more expensive, or deliberately held constant? |
| Adaptation cost | What is spent, delayed, damaged, risked, or made harder by the adaptation? |
| Failure mode | What breakdown, drift, unsafe persistence, or loss of viability shows that the move failed? |

#### C.26.3:4.1 - Homeostasis and allostasis reading

`Homeostasis` means keeping a parameter or bundle inside viable bounds. `Allostasis` means preserving functioning through separately governed changes to internal settings, external relations, boundary conditions, or operating regime when circumstances change.

Do not say that all architecture is homeostasis. Say that some architecture decisions are viability-envelope decisions.

#### C.26.3:4.2 - Finish conditions

This pattern emits one of these results:

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Envelope-regulation claim | State the exact object filling the local viability-bearer position and the pattern used to identify it, protected promise/function, envelope variables, viable region/bounds, disturbance, sensors/probes, candidate interventions, boundary condition, trade-off condition, authority, latency, adaptation cost, and failure mode. |
| Candidate-intervention recovery or redesign | Recover the direct object first. Revise only the current proposal—its Method or description, setting proposal, WorkPlan, access or permission claim, or Bridge proposal or description—and separately identify any dated Work, actual transformation or other change, obtaining relation occurrence, and resulting state under their subject patterns. Authorized Work or transformation may later establish, change, or end an actual relation; do not identify that occurrence with the proposal. Do not let a cache, staffing, protocol, access, measurement, or other source label choose the object. |
| Measurement/probe redesign | Redesign a dashboard, alert, health check, readiness score, or review process because it distorts the envelope it reports. |
| Ordinary neighboring-pattern application | Use `C.25`, `C.16`, `A.6`, `A.15`, `U.Dynamics`, `C.18`, `C.19`, or `A.19` when the QL cue is not load-bearing. |
| No envelope claim | Drop the viability-envelope wording when the exact object for the local viability-bearer position and the pattern used to identify it, protected promise/function, viable region/bounds, disturbance, candidate interventions, adaptation cost, and failure mode cannot be stated. |

#### C.26.3:4.3 - Metric-induced distortion

Treat sensors, probes, dashboards, alerts, and metrics as possible participants in the viability relation, not as neutral windows by default.

| Anti-pattern | What goes wrong | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metric-as-envelope | A proxy is treated as the whole envelope. | Recover the exact object filling the local viability-bearer position and the pattern used to identify it, protected promise, full envelope, unmeasured dimensions, and admissible use. |
| Goodharted viability | Actors optimize measured slots while damaging unmeasured survivor relations or future adaptability. | Treat probe-caused behavior with `C.26.1`; add evidence for unmeasured envelope dimensions. |
| Intervention overfit | A proposed or enacted move preserves one parameter while pushing another cost, latency, boundary relation, or promise outside bounds. | Add the trade-off condition, authority, latency, adaptation cost, and failure mode; recover any Method, description, plan, Work, change, setting, or relation under its subject pattern. |

#### C.26.3:4.4 - Conditional dynamics detail

When rate, acceleration, second-order change, inertia, damping, resistance, effort, or the strength and latency of a recovered intervention or resulting actual change is load-bearing, state:

- what rate or acceleration matters;
- what slows or speeds the change;
- whether the rate of change itself is changing, rebounding, overshooting, or damping out;
- which inertia is useful and which is harmful;
- which recovered intervention object is proposed, what Work, relation, or setting change can lawfully realize it, and which independently grounded actual change affects the envelope fast enough;
- which evidence shows the dynamic state.

If those variables are not load-bearing, do not force dynamics machinery into the case. The short recognition note or the full envelope-regulation record is enough.

#### C.26.3:4.5 - Primary EntityOfConcern and operational sequence

The primary EntityOfConcern is a viability-envelope claim or plan. It is not a generic quality score, not a control-theory survey, and not a biological analogy. The claim identifies one exact object under its subject pattern, states the separately governed promise, function, or operating-regime claim being protected, and declares the characteristic region within which the object satisfies the current viability bounds under named disturbances, probes, sensors, candidate interventions, boundary conditions, and adaptation costs.

The first useful move is to turn a one-scalar stability story into an inspectable envelope-regulation decision.

Envelope-regulation sequence:

1. Point the local viability-bearer position to one exact object already identified through the pattern for that object, and name the separately governed promise or function being preserved. If service or market language is used, recover the object first: a system needs its A.1 basis; a selected system-role configuration or other structure needs the pattern for its exact relation or structure; a population or market slice needs its declared domain and effective reference scheme, membership or scope, and identity basis. Only then add each current promise-content, system-role-assignment, commitment, Work-occurrence, or evidence claim through the pattern that defines that object or relation. If no exact object is established, stop instead of turning the wording into a bearer.
2. Name the envelope variables and the viable range or qualitative boundary for each.
3. Name the disturbance or regime change.
4. Name sensors/probes and say whether they only report, also frame, or also change behavior.
5. Name each candidate intervention and recover the exact object of the proposal: Method or description, setting proposal, WorkPlan, access or permission claim, or Bridge proposal or description. Separately identify any dated Work, actual transformation or other change, obtaining relation occurrence, or resulting state claimed to exist. Name an acting system and assignment only for Work; ground any actual change independently. A later authorized Work or transformation may establish, change, or end an access, permission, assignment, or Bridge relation; state the actual relation under its applicable predicate or declaration rather than treating the proposal as the relation occurrence.
6. State the boundary condition being preserved or changed.
7. State the trade-off condition and adaptation cost.
8. State the failure mode and re-probe/destabilization condition.
9. Add dynamics detail only if rate, inertia, damping, latency, resistance, or acceleration changes the decision.

Ordinary output: produce a viability-envelope record with envelope variables and viable region, a disturbance/sensor/probe map, a candidate-intervention-to-direct-object recovery, and a trade-off, adaptation, and failure condition that tells the practitioner what changes in the work.

The output should give one direct next move: revise a MethodDescription or policy episteme, amend a WorkPlan, perform exact Work under its assignment, change a setting through a separately grounded transformation, change an access or permission relation, revise a Bridge occurrence or description, record the resulting state, or drop the envelope claim.

#### C.26.3:4.6 - Viability envelope record

A usable envelope record is a pattern-local writing card, not a constructor. Use the fields below when envelope regulation is load-bearing:

```text
exact object in the local viability-bearer position and pattern used to identify it: ...
protected promise or function: ...
envelope variables: ...
viable region: ...
disturbance: ...
sensors or probes: ...
candidate intervention and recovered direct object: ...
authority and latency for the applicable Work, setting change, or relation: ...
boundary condition: ...
trade-off condition: ...
adaptation cost: ...
failure mode: ...
re-probe or destabilization condition: ...
```

The record is not `U.ViabilityEnvelopeRegulation`, not a new U-kind, and not a universal architecture constructor. It is a pattern-local normal form for writing envelope work clearly.

Well-formedness constraints:

- the local viability-bearer position points to one exact object already identified through the pattern for that object and introduces no kind or relation; a system reading has an A.1 basis, a selected system-role configuration or other structure has the pattern for its exact relation or structure, and a population or market slice has a declared domain and effective reference scheme, membership or scope, and identity basis;
- service or access wording names each current object and relation separately—the exact object in the local viability-bearer position, promise content, system, system-role assignment, commitment, Work occurrence, evidence, or another direct relation—through the pattern that defines that object or relation; the wording creates neither a root bearer nor a bundle;
- at least two envelope dimensions are visible when the claim says "viability" rather than one ordinary metric;
- at least one candidate intervention is named when the text proposes regulation rather than only diagnosis, and its proposal-side Method, description, setting proposal, WorkPlan, access or permission claim, or Bridge proposal or description is recovered under the subject pattern; any dated Work, actual transformation, obtaining relation occurrence, or resulting state is identified separately;
- authority and latency are stated only for an object to which they apply; a description, Method, plan, setting label, Bridge description, or resulting state is not made an actor or Work by this card;
- the adaptation cost is named, because allostasis hides cost when phrased as "stability through change";
- the failure mode is named, because viability is otherwise indistinguishable from optimism.

#### C.26.3:4.7 - Sensor, probe, candidate-intervention, and metric split

Do not let one dashboard value stand for the whole envelope.

| Item | Viability-facing question |
| --- | --- |
| Envelope variable | Which quality, resource, promise, risk, or operating dimension is inside/outside viable range? |
| Sensor | Which metric, alert, trace, health check, survey, review, or observation reports part of the envelope? |
| Probe | Which measurement setup, dashboard, readiness check, review, experiment, or incident query may change behavior or expose hidden dimensions? |
| Candidate intervention | What change is proposed? Recover whether cache, throttle, routing, staffing, protocol, escalation, access, bridge, or context-split wording denotes a Method or description, setting proposal, plan, access or permission claim, or Bridge proposal or description. Separately identify any dated Work, actual transformation or other change, obtaining relation occurrence, or resulting state claimed to exist. |
| Boundary condition | Which access, ownership, context, interface, promise, environment, or information constraint shapes the envelope? |
| Adaptation cost | Which latency, risk, effort, attention, support load, compliance exposure, energy, trust, or future flexibility is spent? |

A metric value or dashboard carrier is neither Work nor an actual change. Its use, publication, or a surrounding governance routine may participate in a separately grounded behavior-changing claim. Name the exact Work and performer assignment when Work is asserted; name any changed setting, actual transformation, access or permission relation, or boundary relation separately. Repairing one envelope variable may still damage another.

#### C.26.3:4.8 - Homeostasis, allostasis, and architecture work

Homeostatic wording is useful when one separately governed claim keeps a variable or bundle inside a stable range. Allostatic wording is useful when preserving the named function requires one or more separately governed setting, boundary, environment, access, staffing, routing, protocol, cache-policy, or operating-regime changes. The wording does not decide whether each item is a Method, description, plan, Work, transformation, relation, or resulting state.

Use the minimal reading that carries the case:

| Reading | Use when | Practical output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scalar quality repair | One characteristic or Q-bundle dimension is enough. | Apply `C.25`, measurement patterns, or evidence patterns as appropriate. |
| Homeostatic envelope | The target is to keep a bundle inside a stable range under disturbance. | State variables, range, disturbance, sensor, candidate intervention with its recovered direct object, and failure mode. |
| Allostatic envelope | Function is preserved through one or more separately governed changes. | State the proposal's exact Method or description, setting proposal, WorkPlan, access or permission claim, or Bridge proposal or description; separately state any dated Work, actual transformation or other change, obtaining relation occurrence, resulting state, and moved cost. |
| Probe-coupled viability | The measurement, dashboard, review, or readiness check changes the envelope it reports. | Coordinate with `C.26.1`. |
| Enacted viability state | Coordinated work evidences the envelope state better than one report. | Coordinate with `C.26.2`. |

Do not call every adaptation allostasis. The term earns its place only when stability-through-change is the useful architecture reading.

#### C.26.3:4.9 - Case bank and near misses

| Case | Supported C.26.3 reading | Near miss / reroute |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Checkout cache under spike | Cache aggressiveness preserves latency but increases stale payment-failure status and support load. | If only cache latency is at issue, use ordinary performance and quality-bundle patterns. |
| Smart-building energy control | Energy, comfort, privacy, occupancy, and abrupt weather changes form one envelope with sensors and candidate interventions recovered under their subject patterns. | If the case only tunes one thermostat setting, use ordinary control/measurement language and state any actual setting change separately. |
| Incident staffing | A proposed staffing intervention may preserve recovery time while increasing coordination overhead and error risk; recover whether the proposal concerns a Method or description, staffing or assignment-setting proposal, or WorkPlan. Separately identify any dated staffing Work, changed assignment relation, other actual change, or resulting state claimed to exist. | If staffing is merely a work-allocation issue, use `A.15` and planning patterns. |
| Compliance exposure | A fast remediation path lowers outage time but increases evidence gaps and audit risk. | If audit evidence is primary, apply `A.10` or `B.3`; keep C.26.3 only for envelope trade-off. |
| Service boundary split | Splitting a service reduces deployment coupling but increases bridge loss and operational support transfer cost. | If the issue is only semantic bridge loss, use `F.9`; if the split changes the envelope, use C.26.3. |
| Body-temperature analogy | Function may be preserved by clothing, room air, activity, or exposure, not only internal heat production. | Use only as explanatory analogy; do not make biology the proof for software. |

#### C.26.3:4.10 - Source-to-pattern translation

Allostasis, active inference, FEP, Markov blankets, and computational-boundary sources are useful here only after translation into FPF architecture terms:

| Source-side term | FPF-facing translation |
| --- | --- |
| Homeostasis | Keep one parameter or bundle inside viable bounds. |
| Allostasis | Preserve function through one or more separately governed changes to settings, environment, boundary condition, or operating regime; the source term does not determine Method, description, plan, Work, transformation, relation, or resulting state. |
| Active inference / perception as action | Measurement, sensor placement, and action have cost and can change later state estimates. |
| Markov blanket or computational boundary | Statistical or probabilistic boundary-lens cue only after recovery. Accepted local Markov dynamics stay with `A.3.3`; lens use stays with `C.29`, and C.26 or C.26.3 stays current only when quantum-like, probe, frame, viability, or measure-model-act claims remain. Physical boundary, interface module, component, functional element, boundary description or publication, and agency threshold require their subject patterns; Markov wording does not admit them by itself. |
| Criticality / metastability | Stability may be regime-bounded and fluctuation-bearing, not one final fixed point. |
| Expected free energy / precision control | Information gathering, action, and confidence have cost; use only when those costs change the architecture decision. |

This translation keeps the pattern practical for architects. The reader should be able to move from a source line to one governed move: change a metric or probe; recover the candidate proposal as its exact Method or description, setting proposal, WorkPlan, access or permission claim, or Bridge proposal or description; separately identify any dated Work, actual transformation or other change, obtaining relation occurrence, or resulting state; where authorized Work or a transformation establishes, changes, or ends the relation, state the actual relation under its applicable predicate or declaration; change a boundary condition; state a trade-off; or reroute.

### C.26.3:5 - Archetypal Grounding

Tell: A platform team tries to preserve checkout latency during a traffic spike. The first move is to increase cache aggressiveness. Latency improves, but support load rises because stale payment-failure status causes confused customer contacts.

Show, System side: take `CheckoutSystem-1` as a case premise: it has already been independently recognized under A.1 as the deployed `U.System` whose viability envelope the team regulates. If that recognition is unavailable, stop; *checkout*, *payment*, and *service* wording do not establish the bearer. Keep the protected promise separate: `CheckoutPromiseContent-1` is the `U.PromiseContent` stating the checkout outcome and reliability on which the customer may rely. For this envelope decision, latency and payment-correctness measurements support claims about selected behaviour and results of `CheckoutSystem-1`; support-load measurement concerns the team's dated support Work; operator-attention measurement concerns the people doing that Work; and customer-promise reliability is tested by a separate evaluation of whether `CheckoutPromiseContent-1` is fulfilled. The decision uses these claims as distinct constraints; it does not turn them into facets of one bearer. Candidate interventions are proposed cache-policy, retry-policy, or routing changes. If the team plans one as intended Work, place that intention in a `U.WorkPlan`; the proposal is not `U.Work`. Use `U.Work` only for one independently identified dated occurrence that satisfies A.15.1's performer-system, covering-assignment, enacted-Method, temporal-extent, and containing-system basis, and state the cache-setting or routing change separately. This case asserts only the observed cache-setting change, not a Work individual. A dashboard query remains a probe unless the case separately names a behaviour-changing occurrence. Changing escalation terms or a context Bridge keeps the resulting promise content, commitment, Bridge occurrence, or Bridge description separate from any dated Work and change occurrence that produces or revises it. Here the observed cache-setting change improves latency while stale payment-failure status increases support load, so optimizing one declared dimension damages another.

Show, Episteme side: the supported claim is not "latency is the viability state." It is an envelope-regulation claim: the observed cache-setting change preserved latency while damaging another envelope dimension. The text records that actual change separately from the proposed cache-policy intervention and makes no Work claim without the A.15.1 basis. The repair is to state the trade-off, adaptation cost, applicable authority and latency, and failure mode.

### C.26.3:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern biases authors against scalar comfort. That bias prevents "green dashboard" from replacing viability.

It also biases authors toward actionable architecture work. The pattern asks which direct object a boundary, access, protocol, staffing, cache, throttle, bridge, or measurement proposal denotes and how quickly its separately governed effects can matter. It names a performer and assignment only for Work and grounds any actual transformation separately.

The pattern may feel too broad if it is applied to every quality concern. It is not for every quality concern. Use `C.25` alone when one quality bundle or metric can be handled without envelope, disturbance, boundary condition, recovered candidate intervention, adaptation cost, or viability failure mode.

### C.26.3:7 - Conformance Checklist

### C.26.3:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One metric as viability | Availability, latency, or score stands for the whole envelope. | Add the exact object filling the local viability-bearer position and the pattern used to identify it, protected promise, other dimensions, and failure mode. |
| Fixed setpoint thinking | Stability means one variable must never move. | Ask whether allostasis preserves function by changing settings, environment, boundary, or regime. |
| Passive sensor assumption | A dashboard is treated as neutral even after it changes behavior. | Use `C.26.1` and evidence patterns. |
| Candidate intervention without a recovered object, predicate, or applicable authority | The text recommends a change without recovering its proposal-side Method, description, setting proposal, WorkPlan, access or permission claim, or Bridge proposal or description; fails to identify separately any dated Work, actual transformation, obtaining relation occurrence, or resulting state on which it relies; or claims Work no system can perform in time. | Recover the proposal-side object first; identify every actuality separately under its subject pattern; state authority and latency only for the applicable Work, change, or relation. |
| Biological proof jump | Homeostasis or FEP language is used as proof for software or organizations. | Treat it as modeling discipline and apply existing FPF patterns to claims. |
| Markov-blanket collapse | A statistical separation, physical interface, interface module, functional element, component, boundary description, and agency threshold are all called the Markov blanket. | Split the source phrase through `A.6.RSIR`: use `C.29` or `C.26` for lens use; use `A.1` plus the direct relation pattern for holon delimitation or boundary crossing; use `A.6.P`, `A.6.0`, and `A.6.5` for relation, signature, or slot claims; use `A.6.M` for module-interface claims; use `A.6.F` for functional claims; use `A.14`, `C.13`, or `B.3.5` for component claims; use `C.30.AD` or `E.17` for descriptions; use `A.13`, `A.19`, or `C.16` for agency-threshold claims. |

### C.26.3:9 - Consequences

This pattern helps architects see stability-through-change. It supports decisions about candidate interventions only after each throttling, staffing, routing, protocol, context-boundary, cache, measurement, or escalation proposal is recovered as its exact Method, description, setting proposal, WorkPlan, access or permission claim, or Bridge proposal or description, while any dated Work, actual transformation or other change, obtaining relation occurrence, and resulting state remain separately grounded.

The cost is that simple metric stories become less simple. That is acceptable when the metric story hides the actual viability relation.

### C.26.3:10 - Rationale

Ordinary quality-bundle work does not always show boundary conditions, candidate interventions and their recovered direct objects, disturbances, adaptation cost, and failure modes together. C.26.3 coordinates those elements while preserving ordinary FPF patterns.

The QL lens is secondary. It matters when the way viability is probed, exported, or coarsened changes the state reading or admissible use of the representation.

### C.26.3:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Pattern claim | Practice source | Pattern implication | Adoption stance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Viability maintenance is not fixed-value homeostasis only; stability can be relational, variational, dynamic, allostatic, metastable, and resilient. | [Conceptual foundations of physiological regulation incorporating the free energy principle and self-organized criticality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763423004281). | Use viability envelopes and stability-through-change; reject one-scalar optimization and "all architecture is homeostasis." | Adapt as architecture-facing envelope discipline. |
| Action and perception are coupled under partial observability and cost. | [Active inference as a theory of sentient behavior](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051123002612). | Treat sensors, probes, dashboards, and source-labelled actuators as relevant to the envelope claim when they change behavior or viability; recover each candidate intervention as its exact FPF object before relying on it. | Adapt for measurement-as-action and planning cost. |
| Active-inference engineering already appears in energy/building control under privacy, partial observability, evolving conditions, and abrupt changes. | [Active Inference for Energy Control and Planning in Smart Buildings and Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18161). | Use engineering examples cautiously: they show the kind of control problem, not settled FPF doctrine. | Use as emerging engineering anchor. |
| Boundaries can be statistical or computational descriptions of what a system can measure, model, and affect. | [The Computational Boundary of a Self](https://philpapers.org/rec/LEVTCB-3) and [The Markov blankets of life](https://philarchive.org/rec/KIRTMB). | Name boundary conditions and information constraints without reifying a boundary substance. | Adapt with map-territory caution. |
| Excess Bayesian / active-embodied inference shows the cost of moving sensor, body, instrument, or access point to obtain a discriminating observation. | [Connecting the free energy principle with quantum cognition](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2022.910161/full). | Treat probe placement, access placement, and observation cost as part of viability-envelope work when they change the decision. | Adapt for probe/action cost, not as a replacement for ordinary Bayesian or active-inference routes. |
| Platform and software engineering already treats many quality concerns as trade-off bundles. | Reliability, incident, platform, compliance, energy, support, operator-load practice, and [Google SRE SLO / error-budget practice](https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/), coordinated with `C.25`. | Make the quality bundle explicit, recover each candidate intervention as its direct object, and state applicable authority, latency, adaptation cost, and failure mode. | Adopt through FPF quality-bundle routes. |

Worked-slice discipline from these rows:

- state the envelope before importing source terminology;
- translate source terms into selected structures, `ArchitectureOf@Context` relations, architecture descriptions, structural views, or named C.30 subcases;
- keep sensors, probes, metrics, candidate interventions, and every recovered direct object distinct;
- state adaptation cost and failure mode;
- apply ordinary quality and measurement patterns to one-scalar quality concerns.

### C.26.3:12 - Relations

**C.27 temporal-claim relation.**

- C.27 may flag: braking, throttling, cadence, recovery, or stabilization moves in claims such as slow rollout protecting support capacity, request throttling preventing collapse, or cadence change preserving attention/team health.
- This pattern keeps: viability bearer, protected promise/function, viable region, disturbance, sensor/probe/candidate-intervention/direct-object split, adaptation cost, and failure mode.
- Non-admissible use: stabilization wording is not a viability envelope, and C.27 is not the pattern for all stability-through-change claims.
- Exit: if the claim being made is only better quality, healthier team, or more resilient service without a declared viability envelope, use C.25, E.13, or the relevant quality/proxy/value pattern rather than C.26.3 or a C.27 profile.

- Builds on: `C.26`, `C.25`, `U.Dynamics`, `A.6`, `A.15`, `C.16`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.3`, `A.19`, `C.18`, `C.19`.
- Coordinates with: `C.26.1` when sensors, probes, dashboards, or metrics change represented state; `C.26.2` when coordinated work evidences the envelope state.
- Does not replace: ordinary quality-bundle patterns, generic control theory, full FEP doctrine, or biological homeostasis claims outside FPF bridge and loss discipline.
- Name boundary: `Viability-Envelope Boundary Regulation` names architecture work over a viability envelope and boundary/action conditions, not `Homeostasis Pattern`, `Allostasis Doctrine`, `Control Ontology`, `Quality Optimization Pattern`, or `Viability Substance`.
