## C.24 - Agentic Tool-Use and Call Planning (C.Agent-Tools-CAL)

> **Type:** Calculus (C)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

**Plain-name.** Agentic tool-use and call planning.

**Intent.** Govern admissible tool-call planning and replanning under explicit budget, assurance, and policy while keeping upstream choice, pool policy, planning, and execution distinct.

**Instantiates and refines Pillars.** `E.2` `P-3` Scalable Formality, `P-7` Pragmatic Utility, `P-10` Open-Ended Evolution, `P-11` SoTA Alignment, and the Bitter-Lesson Preference: prefer scalable, general methods that benefit from more data or compute over fragile hand-tuned heuristics when assurance and cost stay comparable.

**Depends on.** A-kernel (`A.1–A.15`) for holonic basics and the separation of admitted Systems, local system-role kinds or assignments when current, Methods, and Work; `B.3` Trust & Assurance (`F–G–R` with CL penalties); `E.3` and `E.5` for precedence and Guard-Rails; `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, `B.1.6`, `C.16`, and `A.10` for dated work, resource aggregation, measurement, cost, and provenance; planned `C.5` `Resrc-CAL` only as a future consolidation; `C.18` `NQD-CAL` for candidate generation and declared set results; `C.19` `E/E-LOG` for explore-exploit policies; optional `Compose-CAL` and `KD-CAL` where available.

**Coordinates with.** `U.WorkPlan` and `U.PromiseContent` bindings (acceptance gates), Working-Model publication discipline per `B.3`, and evidence or provenance (`G.6`).

### C.24:0 - Use this when

- one concrete choice result already exists and the next task is now how to plan, gate, sequence, and replan tool calls admissibly
- the next admissible output should be one enactment-facing `CallPlan` or one `CheckpointReturn`, not one more local choice result or pool-policy result
- budget, assurance, and stop conditions must be visible before calls are burned

### C.24:0.1 - What goes wrong if missed

- calls get scheduled by ad-hoc heuristics, so the plan cannot say which budget is being burned or what event should stop or replan execution
- planning quietly collapses into execution, or execution quietly inherits unresolved upstream choice and pool-policy questions
- a successful probe is mistaken for committed rollout even though the commit trigger was never made explicit

### C.24:0.2 - What this buys

- one tool-agnostic planning record for admissible calls, budgets, stop conditions, and replan triggers
- one explicit enactment-facing plan or bounded checkpoint with objective, budget, stop conditions, and next planned action, without presenting intent as actual Work
- one replayable call graph and assurance record instead of one opaque chain of tool invocations

**Primary working object.** One `ATC.CallPlan : U.WorkPlan` for intended calls. Each planned call selects an exact independently admitted `U.Method`; a current route description is a separate C.2.1 `U.MethodDescription` episteme that describes and may help identify, constrain or justify that Method or intended Work. Actual tool-call Work, its performer System, obtaining assignment, interval, containing system and `enactsMethod` relation remain downstream A.15.1 facts.

**First useful move.** For each planned call, name the exact `methodRef` first, then cite an edition-pinned `methodDescriptionRef` only if its route description is needed. State order, budget, stop/replan condition and next action without claiming that Work occurred.

**Not this pattern when.** If the surviving option or pool policy is unresolved, use `C.11` or `C.19`. If selector-facing result declaration is current, use `G.5`. If that result already exists and actual audience availability is current, use `E.17` for its source-backed publication face and return to source and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence and availability. If the question is only what a callable MethodDescription says, use `A.3.2` for its content and `C.2.1` for its episteme identity. If the question is whether a call actually occurred or what Method it enacted, use `A.15.1`; if work-entry readiness is the question, use `A.15.5`.

### C.24:0.3 - First-minute questions

- Has one choice result already been fixed with the accepted decision material named, and does every planned call resolve to an exact independently admitted Method rather than only a route-description label?
- Which budget is being burned now: enactment budget, tool-call budget, or still one upstream probe budget?
- What event stops or replans the route?
- Is the next admissible output one `CallPlan`, one `CheckpointReturn`, or a neighbouring-pattern exit?

### C.24:0.4 - First output

The first useful output is either one enactment-facing `CallPlan` with the current objective, planned call steps selecting exact `U.Method` refs, any separately cited route descriptions, the planned budget envelope, the stop or replan condition, and the next planned action stated explicitly in one place, or one bounded `CheckpointReturn` with the current objective or task family, the exact Methods and descriptions tested when recovered, the burned and residual actual budget, the commit trigger, and the recommended next action stated explicitly in one place.

In C.24, move-like wording is plan-local shorthand only when it means `nextPlannedAction` inside a `CallPlan` or `recommendedNextAction` inside a `CheckpointReturn`. It does not name a general project move, pattern-use recommendation, work-entry readiness relation, performed work, or a whole `U.WorkPlan`. If the current source wording asks which FPF pattern use is recommended, use `E.11.PUR`; if it asks whether intended work is ready to start, use `A.15.5`; if it uses move-like wording outside C.24 call planning, restore the project concern with `E.10.MOVE`.

If that first output still cannot be written honestly, the current planning result is not finished `C.24` planning yet.

### C.24:1 - Problem frame

Modern tool-using Systems increasingly rely on tool-call planning: selecting admissible tool-service routes, arranging intended call Work, and replanning under uncertainty. A local agential-system-role classification or assignment is included only when the current claim needs that separate fact. Without a calculus:

* calls are scheduled by **ad-hoc heuristics**,
* **budgets** (compute, cost, wall-time) are implicit,
* **assurance** and **policy provenance** are lost, and
* tool-using Systems either over-constrain their plans with brittle scripts or wander without guard-rails.

This CAL provides the **conceptual API for thought** that lets any implementation (LLM-based, search-based, code-based, robotic) plan calls **admissibly**, **auditably**, and **scalably**. It keeps the planning System, any separately current classification or assignment, selected Methods, intended plan, and actual Work distinct.

Immediate failure indicators for this pattern:

* the current planning result cannot say whether one choice result already exists,
* the current text cannot distinguish exact Method, route-description episteme, call plan, and executed call Work,
* the budget being burned is still only probing-before-choice budget rather than enactment or tool-call budget, or
* the next admissible output is still undefined as one enactment-facing plan, one `CheckpointReturn`, or one neighbouring-pattern exit.

If the question under repair is still which fixed option should survive now, apply `C.11`. If it is still pool policy over several still-live candidate lines, apply `C.19`. If it is already selector-facing result declaration, apply `G.5`. If that result already exists and must be presented or made available to an audience, use `E.17` for its source-backed publication face and return to source and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence and availability.

### C.24:2 - Problem
We need a **tool-agnostic** way to (i) identify exact admissible `U.Method` values and any auxiliary route descriptions, (ii) compose one **call work plan** whose steps select those Methods, (iii) allocate an **explore/exploit** share, (iv) enforce **budget & harm** gates, and (v) **replan** on signals—**without** baking domain-specific heuristics into the core and **without** collapsing `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.WorkPlan`, and `U.Work` into one object.

### C.24:3 - Forces

| Force                                    | Tension                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **General methods vs. bespoke local heuristics**       | Scalable, model-centric search ↔ short-term wins of bespoke scripts (guarded by **Bitter-Lesson Preference**).        |
| **Assurance vs. Autonomy**               | F-G-R gates & CL penalties ↔ system latitude to sequence calls and learn online.                                       |
| **Exploration vs. Delivery**             | Exploration share for illumination ↔ delivery SLAs and cost ceilings (E/E-LOG policy).                                |
| **Method vs. route vs. plan vs. execution** | exact `U.Method` ↔ separate `U.MethodDescription` ↔ `U.WorkPlan` ↔ dated `U.Work` ↔ service promises (`U.PromiseContent`). |

### C.24:4 - Solution — Signature & Realization

**Local value names.**
*`ATC.CallRouteDescription`* is a `U.MethodDescription` with `accessSpec` for one tool service or callable route. Its exact C.2.1 EntityOfConcern is an independently admitted `U.Method`; the description describes and may help identify, constrain or justify that Method or intended Work for one receiving use but is neither the Method nor anything executed;
*`ATC.CallPlan`* is a `U.WorkPlan` specialised for intended tool-call work. Each planned call step selects one exact `U.Method` by `methodRef` and may separately cite a current `ATC.CallRouteDescription` by `methodDescriptionRef`, plus planned order, budget ceilings, stop or replan triggers, and `nextPlannedAction`;
*`ATC.CallGraph`* is an evidence or provenance graph over a ledger of exact actual `U.Work` call occurrences. A graph entry cites the Work occurrence and exact Method; an optional route-description edition helps interpretation but creates neither occurrence nor `enactsMethod`;
*`ATC.Policy`* references `U.EmitterPolicyRef` (E/E-LOG) and local call gates **including BLP tolerances (alpha, delta)**.

**Systems, plans, and Work.**
An admitted planning System may perform planning or revision Work that prepares or revises one **CallPlan** whose planned steps select exact Methods and may cite separate **CallRouteDescription** editions. When planning, revision, a call, or observation is claimed as actual Work, name the `U.Work` occurrence and keep all facts required by A.15.1, A.2.1, and F.6 recoverable. A short C.24 sentence may omit only an assignment identifier unused by its call-planning claim. A local kind and a separate System-classification judgment remain optional facts; the assignment occurrence and F.6 attribution do not become optional once actual Work is asserted. Route descriptions stay design-time epistemes; the call plan stays schedule-of-intent; actual call Work stays run-time; service promise content remains a separate acceptance object. None establishes another by record inclusion.

**Operators (Gamma_agential; CAL, conceptual):**

1. `Gamma_agential.eligible(tool, TaskSignature, PolicyEdition, IntendedUse, ClaimScope?, ValidityWindow?) -> {true|false, notes}`
   *Eligibility gate* based on capability fit, the cited policy edition and its allow-list or deny-list, intended use, any action-changing ClaimScope or validity window, and the applicable safety constraints.

2. `Gamma_agential.enumerate(TaskSignature, PolicyEdition, IntendedUse, ClaimScope?, ValidityWindow?) -> CandidateSet<ATC.CallRouteDescription>`
   Returns admissible callable route descriptions. It **MAY** delegate to **NQD-CAL** for heterogeneous route families and **MUST** apply the current **E/E-LOG lens** (objectives & telemetry) to tag candidates. Before a candidate enters an enactment-facing plan, its C.2.1 episteme must resolve under the effective reference scheme and identify the exact independently admitted Method; an unresolved route label remains probe material, not a planned enactment.

3. `Gamma_agential.plan(Objective, CandidateSet, Budget, ATC.Policy) -> ATC.CallPlan`
   Produces one **call plan** whose ordered planned-call steps select exact `U.Method` refs and may separately cite selected route-description epistemes. It declares one planned budget envelope (compute, cost, time, risk), one intended call order, and one stop or replan policy. Internal route logic may remain in the cited descriptions; the plan is a `U.WorkPlan`, not a Method, not a MethodDescription, and not yet Work.

4. `Gamma_agential.execute(ATC.CallPlan) -> {ATC.CallGraph, Observations}`
   Executes with **hard gates** (budget, risk, constraint-fit). For each actual call, name its `U.Work` occurrence and keep all facts required by A.15.1, A.2.1, and F.6 recoverable, including the admitted performer System and the Method enacted by the dated Work. The operator logs provenance suitable for B.3 assurance reporting while keeping plan, description, Work, Method and service promise separate.

5. `Gamma_agential.replan(Signals, ATC.CallPlan, BudgetPrime) -> ATC.CallPlanPrime`
   Triggered by sentinel breaches, assurance drops, or policy events; preserves or explicitly revises the ordered exact Method refs, separately cited route descriptions, policy edition, intended use, ClaimScope, validity and re-evaluation windows, safety constraints, and other plan content. Changing a description reference does not silently change either the Method or any actual Work history.

6. `Gamma_agential.score(Route or PlanAlternative) -> <ValueProxies, Cost, Risk, FGR_floor>`
   Computes selection signals **without** illegal scalarisation across mixed scales; **uses Pareto comparison under the C.19 E/E-LOG lens** and leaves final dominance to declared policies.

#### C.24:4.1 - Bounded scout/probe cycle for unfamiliar task families

When the choice result is already fixed enough that enactment planning is admissible under `C.24`, but the route across heterogeneous or unfamiliar callable approaches is still uncertain, the system may spend a bounded scout/probe budget before committed rollout and return one checkpoint package that compares the tested routes.

If additional probing could still change which option survives the current `OptionSet`, the budget is still `C.11`-side epistemic budget and the question reroutes upstream. If choice result is already fixed and the uncertainty is only about route or rollout shape, the budget is now enactment budget and the checkpoint belongs in `C.24`.

That `CheckpointReturn` should state the declared utility objective and current `TaskFamily`, the route descriptions or candidate approaches tested, the evidence on each route, the burned and residual actual budget, the recommended next action, and the commit trigger named by value that would justify leaving probe state.

A successful probe does not by itself justify a larger burn or a committed rollout. `C.24` carries the `CheckpointReturn` record and call-plan semantics for this probe loop; `A.15` carries the DesignRunTag split and `E.16` carries the budget partition plus guard and ledger enforcement. Low-human-overlap approaches remain sound only while they stay tied to the declared utility objective, budget boundaries, and evidence locus explicitly.

**Bridge to neighboring patterns.** `ProbeBudget` belongs to `C.11` while it means epistemic budget for further probing before choice. `C.24` carries budgets once they are enactment, tool-call, or rollout budgets. If the question is still which option survives now, apply `C.11`; if it is pool policy over several still-live candidate lines, apply `C.19`; if it is selector-facing declaration of the selected result, apply `G.5`. If that declared result must be presented or made available to an audience, use `E.17` for its source-backed publication face and return to source and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence and availability.

**Explicit enactment result.** A conformant `C.24` pass should therefore leave either one enactment-facing `CallPlan` that states the current objective, each planned exact Method ref and any separate route-description ref, planned call order, planned budget envelope, stop or replan condition, and next planned action, or one `CheckpointReturn` that states the current objective or task family, tested Methods and descriptions when recovered, burned and residual actual budget, evidence locus, commit trigger, and recommended next action.

**Unfinished-state rule.** A `C.24` result remains unfinished when a planned call has only a route label and no recovered exact Method, when it cannot say whether execution should continue now, pause at one checkpoint, or reroute, when it confuses Method with description, description with plan, or plan with executed Work, or when it does not state which budget is planned versus already burned and what event would stop or replan the current route.

**Normative Laws (ATC-Laws).**

* **ATC-1 (Model-the-Call, not the App).** One actual tool call is a dated **Work** occurrence that enacts one exact independently admitted **Method** under A.15.1. A current route description is a separate C.2.1 MethodDescription episteme that describes and may help identify, constrain or justify that Method or intended Work; a Service's `U.PromiseContent` is a separate acceptance object. Plans schedule intended calls but are neither Methods, descriptions, service promises, nor actual calls.
* **ATC-2 (Bitter-Lesson Preference).** When two admissible choices are within **delta (assurance)** and **alpha (budget)**, **prefer the more general, scale-benefiting method** whose **slope vector Pareto-dominates** under the declared E/E-LOG objectives; any override **MUST** record a **BLP-waiver** with expiry. (E.2; precedence governed by E.3.)
* **ATC-3 (Budget & Harm Gates).** Plans **SHALL** declare ceilings on compute, cost, wall-time, and risk; execution **MUST** abort or replan on breach. Actual burned or residual budget belongs in `CheckpointReturn`, `CallGraph`, or other work-side reporting, not inside the `CallPlan` field set.
* **ATC-4 (Explore-Share Discipline).** Plans **MUST** declare `explore_share`; defaults **inherit from E/E-LOG profiles**. **Informative defaults**: `0` for safety-critical or deterministic tasks; `approx 0.2-0.4` for ambiguous tasks with heterogeneous tool families. Promotion of illumination telemetry into dominance **requires explicit policy**.
* **ATC-5 (Provenance & Replay).** Every actual call **MUST** emit a **CallGraph** row with its exact Work ref, exact enacted Method ref, performer System, obtaining assignment, Service id, optional cited MethodDescription edition, inputs and outputs (redacted per privacy), `CallPlan` ref, **EmitterPolicyRef**, actual interval, and budget deltas. The graph records these facts; it creates none of them. (NQD/E/E provenance fields apply when used.)
* **ATC-6 (Assurance-First Decisions).** Selection **MUST** respect B.3: WLNK minima on the F and R dimensions (weakest-link floors), CL penalties on integration, and **no** chimera scores across design-time and run-time scopes. State **<F,G,R>** for the typed claim that this plan is admissible for the cited policy edition, intended use, ClaimScope, and qualification window.
* **ATC-7 (Notation and Vendor Independence).** Core pattern text **MUST NOT** encode vendor-specific tokens. Keep a vendor binding in its separate adapter or profile description and state the exact source scheme, intended use, and relation to the selected Method. (Lexical guard-rails.)

#### C.24:4.1a - Planning under budget must consume the same declared doctrine
#### C.24:4.1b - Causal action-use spec for call plans

When a tool-call plan selects observation, intervention, counterfactual-rung evidence collection, counterfactual policy conditioning, or off-policy causal evaluation work, the `CallPlan` carries an optional causal action-use spec and cites `C.28` for the causal-use authority.

Optional `CallPlan.causalActionUseSpec?`:

```text
CallPlan.causalActionUseSpec? {
  causalUseQuestionRef?: U.CausalUseQuestion
  targetCausalityLadderRung: CausalityLadderRung
  causalUseClaimKind: CausalUseClaimKind
  naturalBehaviorPolicyRef?: NaturalBehaviorPolicyRef
  evaluationPolicyRef?: EvaluationPolicyRef
  causalEvidenceSupportBasis?: CausalEvidenceSupportBasis
  causalInterventionSpecRef?
  counterfactualConditioningRef?
  counterfactualSamplingRealizabilityProfileRef?
  causalUseEvidenceDesignRef?
  offPolicyCausalEvaluationProfileRef?
  causalUseSupportRecordRef?: CausalUseSupportRecordRef
  causalUseSupportVerdict?: CausalUseSupportVerdict
  supportedUse: CausalUseSupportStatement
  unsupportedUse: CausalUseUnsupportedStatement
}
```

The causal action-use tail may be omitted only when the call plan does not reach `CausalUseActivation`: it is not using the call sequence as causal support, not choosing between observation/intervention/counterfactual-policy regimes, and not publishing the result as causal evidence. If the plan says the call will prove, estimate, improve, prevent, or counterfactually establish an outcome, the support tail is present or the wording is downgraded.

What changes in practice: a call plan that probes, intervenes, samples, simulates, or evaluates a policy for a causal purpose must state `CausalUseClaimKind` and the causal regime of the planned action before execution evidence is treated as support for a causal-use claim.

What this does not establish: `C.24` does not estimate effects, prove identification, certify fairness, or turn simulation output into realized counterfactual-rung evidence; it governs admissible call planning and redirects causal-use support to `C.28`.

- Planning should reuse the declared source set, decision lens, probe budget, and stopping condition rather than creating one planning-only choice semantics.
- Budgeted sequencing may mix exploitation and exploration, but the declared source set and the declared reason for the next probe must stay recoverable.
- Use planning language such as `probe next`, `hold as archive`, `apply G.5 for shortlist declaration`, or `stop for now` only when the relevant lens-side reason is stated directly.
- `explore_share`, `backstop_confidence`, probe budgets, and replan triggers are planning harmonization terms for that same declared choice doctrine.
- They may regulate sequence and stopping; they do not redefine `Front`, `Archive`, `Shortlist`, or `SelectionSlot`.
- If the next planned output is one public `Shortlist` or `RankedShortlist`, `C.24` should identify a neighboring result-declaration question and apply `G.5`, not emit the selector artifact itself.

#### C.24:4.2 - Policy profile and BLP precedence

**ATC-Policy fields (conceptual).**
`{ backstop_confidence, explore_share, risk_bound, cost_ceiling, time_ceiling, tie_breakers, novelty_quota?, wild_bet_quota?, stop_conditions, BLP_delta_alpha, BLP_delta_delta }` - realised by referencing an `E/E-LOG` `EmitterPolicy` and adding Bitter-Lesson-Preference clauses. Defaults inherit from `C.19`; any deviation is editioned.

**BLP precedence.** In conflicts with tactics that hard-code narrow scripts, the Bitter-Lesson Preference applies subject to the precedence rules in `E.3` and `E.5`. Where a script encodes safety-critical gating or regulatory compliance, it prevails unless a named rule or policy is current for the case, permits an override, and a decision or waiver is issued under the required authority relation. Record that relation, the decision or waiver, the rationale, the measured hazard avoided, the expiry, and the planned re-evaluation window.

#### C.24:4.3 - Didactic quick card

**Agentic Call Plan (public field set).**

Record:

- the objective and ordered planned calls, with exact Method refs and edition-pinned MethodDescription refs only when needed;
- the time, compute, cost, and risk budget, the policy edition, and `explore_share`, using `0` when no exploration is planned;
- stop and replan conditions and any BLP tolerances; and
- the assurance and provenance refs required by this plan.

If a waiver is used, also state its authority relation, decision or waiver, rationale, measured-hazard evidence, expiry, and re-evaluation window. Add ClaimScope, intended use, or a validity window only when it changes planning or validity.

#### C.24:4.4 - Explicit enactment outputs and closure rule

A finished `C.24` pass should emit one enactment result rather than one vague statement that the system now has a plan.

Two output shapes are admissible here:

- one enactment-facing `CallPlan`; or
- one bounded `CheckpointReturn` when probing is still the admissible next action inside enactment planning.

A `CallPlan` should state at least these fields:

- current objective;
- ordered planned-call steps, each with an exact `methodRef` and a separate edition-pinned `methodDescriptionRef` only when the route description is current;
- active policy or planning state;
- planned budget envelope or reserved budget;
- stop or replan condition;
- `nextPlannedAction` if the current plan is accepted now.

A `CheckpointReturn` should state at least these fields:

- current task family or objective;
- candidate exact Methods and their separate route-description epistemes tested so far, when recovered;
- evidence on those routes;
- burned and residual actual budget;
- recommended next action;
- explicit commit trigger.

A compact result may therefore look like:

```text
CallPlan(
  objective = answer_question_Q,
  policyRef = ee_policy_v1,
  plannedCallsInOrder = [
    {methodRef = SearchMethod_3, methodDescriptionRef = search_route_v3},
    {methodRef = RetrievalMethod_1, methodDescriptionRef = retrieve_route_v1},
    {methodRef = SynthesisMethod_2, methodDescriptionRef = synthesize_route_v2},
    {methodRef = CodeCheckMethod_1, methodDescriptionRef = code_check_route_v1}
  ],
  plannedBudgetEnvelope = {time<=60_minutes, compute<=x1, cost<=y1, risk<=r1},
  stopOrReplan = low_R_or_cost_ceiling,
  nextPlannedAction = enact_now
)
```

or:

```text
CheckpointReturn(
  taskFamily = unfamiliar_lab_protocol,
  testedRoutes = [route_A, route_B],
  burnedBudget = 2_runs,
  residualBudget = 1_run,
  recommendedNextAction = probe_route_B_once_more,
  commitTrigger = route_B_clears_assurance_floor_L1
)
```

Close as one enactment-facing `CallPlan` when the choice result is already fixed enough that execution order, gating, and replanning are now the call-planning question. Close as one `CheckpointReturn` when bounded scout or probe work is still admissible inside enactment planning. Apply the neighboring pattern when the result has fallen back into local choice, pool policy, selector-facing result declaration, or publication availability.

If the result still does not state what should execute now, what budget is planned or already burned, and what event stops or replans the route, it is still unfinished `C.24` work.

#### C.24:4.4a - Worked closure slice

Two short contrasts keep the closure law practical.

**Known route, execution should begin now.**
When the objective and route are already fixed enough, `C.24` should close as one enactment-facing call plan:

```text
CallPlan(
  objective = produce_patch_and_verify,
  plannedCallsInOrder = [
    {methodRef = InspectRepositoryMethod_4, methodDescriptionRef = inspect_repo_route_v3},
    {methodRef = EditCandidateMethod_2, methodDescriptionRef = edit_candidate_route_v2},
    {methodRef = TargetedTestMethod_7, methodDescriptionRef = run_targeted_tests_route_v5}
  ],
  plannedBudgetEnvelope = {time<=45_minutes, compute<=x2, cost<=y2, risk<=r2},
  stopOrReplan = targeted_tests_fail_twice,
  nextPlannedAction = enact_now
)
```

The plan does not claim that any call happened. If the first call is then performed, identify `ToolCallWork-903 : U.Work`, admitted performer System `RepoAutomationSystem-2`, directly declared assignment species `RepoAutomationInspectorAssignment`, its obtaining occurrence `RepoAutomationInspectorAssignment-2`, and the F.6 relation saying that the System performed this Work under that occurrence. The Work runs during `[10:02Z, 10:04Z]`, occurs within `RepairRun-81`, and enacts `InspectRepositoryMethod_4`. Its CallGraph row may cite `inspect_repo_route_v3` as `methodDescriptionRef`; neither that description nor the row is the Work occurrence or the enacted Method. The service's `U.PromiseContent` and any acceptance result remain separate.

**Recognizable near misses.** `inspect_repo_route_v3` with no recovered exact `InspectRepositoryMethod_4` cannot support an enactment-facing plan. A `CallPlan` with no actual Work occurrence is still only intent. A tool log row with no independently grounded Work, performer, assignment and Method is evidence material, not execution. A successful response does not by itself prove the service promise was accepted.

**Unfamiliar route, one bounded scout pass still admissible.**
When the route is still uncertain inside enactment planning, `C.24` should close as one `CheckpointReturn`:

```text
CheckpointReturn(
  taskFamily = unfamiliar_ci_failure,
  testedRoutes = [log_trace_route, minimal_repro_route],
  burnedBudget = 1_probe_cycle,
  residualBudget = 2_probe_cycles,
  recommendedNextAction = run_minimal_repro_once_more,
  commitTrigger = repro_is_stable_and_assurance_floor_L1_holds
)
```

The practical distinction is simple: if route order and budgeted execution are already the call-planning question, emit one `CallPlan`; if bounded scout work is still the call-planning question inside planning, emit one `CheckpointReturn`.

1. **Research-assistance tool-using System.**
   Task: answer a novel technical question. Candidate tools: retrieval, structured web search, code runner, table or plot generator.
   **Plan:** select exact `SearchMethod`, `RetrievalMethod`, `SynthesisMethod`, and `CodeCheckMethod` refs in order; separately cite current route descriptions for `search`, `retrieve`, `synthesize`, and `code_check`; declare `explore_share approx 0.4`; replan on sentinel `low_R`.
   The admissible structure here is one declared budget envelope, one explicit route order, and one visible replan trigger.

2. **Program-repair tool-using System.**
   Task: propose a patch against a failing test suite. Candidate tools: repo introspection, static analyzer, unit runner.
   **Plan:** select exact repo-introspection, patch-application, and targeted-test Methods; keep their optional route-description epistemes distinct; use scout quota across patch families before committed rollout.

3. **Lab-automation tool-using System.**
   Task: adjust a wet-lab protocol under drift. Candidate tools: planner, pipetting controller, spectrometer, Bayesian optimizer.
   **Plan:** a bounded probe or pilot can inform the route, but committed rollout waits for the declared commit trigger and assurance floor.

### C.24:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lexical firewall and notation independence apply; no vendor tokens; mixed-scale characteristics are never averaged; exact `U.Method`, route-description `U.MethodDescription`, `U.WorkPlan`, actual `U.Work`, CallGraph evidence, and service promise remain distinct; a successful probe remains distinct from committed rollout until the commit trigger is satisfied.

### C.24:7 - Conformance Checklist

1. **CC-ATC-1 - Declared separation.** Every planned call step selects an exact independently admitted `U.Method`; `ATC.CallRouteDescription` is a separate `U.MethodDescription` episteme; `ATC.CallPlan` is a `U.WorkPlan`; each execution is exact dated `U.Work` with actual `enactsMethod`; acceptance is via separate `U.PromiseContent`. No description, service promise, CallGraph row, method-side route logic, or actual burn is smuggled into another object.
2. **CC-ATC-2 - Budgets on record.** Time budget, compute budget, cost ceiling, and risk limit exist ex ante; stop conditions are listed.
3. **CC-ATC-3 - E/E policy.** `EmitterPolicyRef` (or equivalent) and `explore_share` are editioned and logged.
4. **CC-ATC-4 - Assurance tuple.** State the typed claim that the plan is admissible for its cited policy edition, intended use, ClaimScope, and qualification window, with `<F,G,R>` and CL penalties traceable in the `CallGraph` SCR. Design-time and run-time are never merged.
5. **CC-ATC-5 - BLP waiver discipline.** Any heuristic override against a general method names the permitting rule or policy that is current for the case and cites the authority relation, decision or waiver issued under it, rationale, measured-hazard evidence, expiry, and re-evaluation date.
6. **CC-ATC-6 - Provenance minimum.** Every actual call record includes `{WorkRef, MethodDescriptionRef? and edition when cited, PromiseContentRef?, CallPlanRef, EmitterPolicyRef, budget deltas, DescriptorMapRef? (if NQD), DistanceDefRef? (if NQD), Seeds?, Dedup?}`. `WorkRef` names the independently identified `U.Work` occurrence. Its Method, interval, containing System, and every performer's assignment species, obtaining occurrence, and F.6 relation remain recoverable under A.15.1, A.2.1, and F.6. Each ref resolves its direct object; the record creates none of them.
7. **CC-ATC-7 - Notation independence.** No vendor tokens in conceptual text; bindings via Bridges or Profiles only.
8. **CC-ATC-8 - BLP tolerances declared.** `alpha/delta` tolerances are present in `ATC.Policy` or referenced via the active `E/E-LOG` profile.
9. **CC-ATC-9 - `CheckpointReturn` for bounded specialization.** When one route still uses scout or probe discipline on a new task family, it SHALL emit one `CheckpointReturn` with candidate routes, evidence, actual budget spent and remaining, next action, and commit trigger; a successful probe alone never counts as committed rollout.
10. **CC-ATC-10 - Recoverable enactment closure.** When `C.24` returns one enactment-facing call plan or one `CheckpointReturn`, the `CallPlan` SHALL state current objective, ordered exact Method refs, separate route-description refs when current, planned budget envelope, stop or replan condition, and `nextPlannedAction`, while `CheckpointReturn` SHALL state actual budget spent and remaining plus next action and commit trigger.
11. **CC-ATC-11 - Neighboring-pattern boundary.** If the question under repair is still fixed-option choice, pool policy over several live lines, selector-facing result declaration, or publication availability, `C.24` SHALL apply `C.11`, `C.19`, or `G.5` as appropriate; when publication is current, it SHALL apply `E.17` for the face and source return and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence and availability. It SHALL NOT restate those patterns.
12. **CC-ATC-12 - Performer discipline.** User-facing prose and emitted artifacts SHALL identify every admitted System that actually performs planning, revision, call, or observation Work, name the corresponding `U.Work` occurrences, and keep all facts required by A.15.1, A.2.1, and F.6 recoverable. A local system-role kind and a separate System-classification judgment are optional only when independently current. A label, kind, classification judgment, assignment species, or assignment occurrence does not perform the Work.
13. **CC-ATC-13 - Causal action-use spec.** If one `CallPlan` selects observation, intervention, counterfactual-rung evidence collection, counterfactual policy conditioning, or off-policy causal evaluation for a causal purpose, it SHALL carry `CallPlan.causalActionUseSpec?` with `targetCausalityLadderRung`, `causalUseClaimKind: CausalUseClaimKind`, supported use, unsupported use, and a `C.28` causal-use support reference rather than letting call-planning vocabulary certify the causal claim.

### C.24:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

- **Treating route description as plan.** Avoid by keeping callable logic in `ATC.CallRouteDescription` and keeping `ATC.CallPlan` as one `U.WorkPlan` whose steps select exact Methods and cite descriptions separately.
- **Treating MethodDescription as enacted Method.** A route document, schema or endpoint description is an episteme, not the world-side way of doing and not what a call enacts. Recover the exact `methodRef`; otherwise keep the candidate in probe state or exit with a missing Method relation.
- **Treating CallGraph or service response as Work.** A graph row and response carrier may evidence a call but do not establish its occurrence, performer, assignment, interval or `enactsMethod`; recover those A.15.1 facts independently.
- **Treating planning as execution.** Avoid by recording actual burn only through `CheckpointReturn`, `Work`, and `CallGraph`, not inside the `CallPlan` field set.
- **Burning enactment budget while the question under repair is still upstream choice or pool policy.** Avoid by rerouting unresolved fixed-option choice to `C.11` and unresolved live-pool governance to `C.19` before building one call plan.
- **Counting a successful probe as committed rollout.** Avoid by emitting one `CheckpointReturn` with a visible commit trigger instead of smuggling rollout through a positive scout result.
- **Hiding stop conditions or replan triggers.** Avoid by making them part of the public `CallPlan` field set rather than one private implementer intuition.

### C.24:9 - Consequences

- tool use by admitted Systems becomes inspectable as one admissible plan, not one opaque sequence of calls
- downstream work receives one explicit enactment-facing plan with objective, exact Method refs, separate route-description refs when current, budget envelope, stop conditions, and `nextPlannedAction`; actual Work is recorded only after it occurs
- the cost is stricter discipline around exact Method versus route-description versus plan versus work separation, explicit budgets, and visible policy state before execution begins

### C.24:10 - Rationale

`C.24` exists because tool-use systems fail in a distinctive way: they can look adaptive while actually hiding route choice, budget burn, stop conditions, and replan logic inside one opaque execution chain. A separate planning calculus is therefore necessary so that tool use remains auditable, replayable, and governable before the first irreversible call is made.

Source-use relation and source-currentness for this rationale: these rows are current-practice pressure and BLP-neighbour alignment, not a standalone `SoTA-Echoing` table. A current tool-use or agentic-loop source becomes load-bearing only when it changes one `CallPlan`, `CheckpointReturn`, budget, stop or replan condition, BLP waiver, or relation row.

- Contemporary tool-using Systems work best when planning, feedback, and replanning stay explicit rather than collapsing into one brittle script. The practical implication is to state one `U.WorkPlan` whose planned steps select exact Methods, cite route-description epistemes separately when current, and carry stop or replan triggers before execution.
- Post-2015 search, optimization, and agentic systems also show that bounded probing is useful but dangerous when it silently becomes commitment. The safeguard here is the explicit `CheckpointReturn` plus visible commit trigger and one explicit split between planned budget envelope and burned actual budget.
- Scaling-first practice favors general, learnable methods over fragile hand-tuned tactics when assurance and cost remain comparable. The practical implication is not blind optimism but disciplined BLP: when a narrow heuristic wins, record the waiver, expiry, and re-evaluation window.
### C.24:12 - Relations

**C.27 temporal-claim relation.**

- C.27 may flag: a tool-use plan claiming that tool use changes debugging, learning, search, repair, rollout, narrowing, uncertainty reduction, stabilization, or stop/replan rate.
- This pattern keeps: call planning, tool-use sequence, budget, stop/replan, and work trace.
- Non-admissible use: tool-call count, a larger prompt or input window, or faster narrowing is effort evidence or input evidence at most; it is not task-success, reasoning-quality, evidence-quality, repair-success, cost, or validity-window evidence by itself.

- Exit: a speed-up claim names task outcome, evaluation harness, repair-success evidence locus when claimed, cost or budget condition, validity window, stop or replan condition, and non-admissible use as a benchmark claim; C.24 remains the tool-use pattern.

Builds on: `A.15` for the separation of Systems, any separately current classification or assignment, Method, plan, Work, and service; `B.3` Trust and Assurance (`F-G-R` with `CL`); and `A.15.1`, `A.15.2`, `B.1.6`, `C.16`, and `A.10` for dated Work, resource aggregation, measurement, cost, and provenance; planned `C.5 Resrc-CAL` is a future consolidation only. It also builds on `C.18 NQD-CAL` (candidate generation and declared set results) and `C.19 E/E-LOG` (policies). Coordinates with `C.28` when a call plan is used to observe, intervene, collect counterfactual-rung evidence, condition a counterfactual policy, or evaluate a policy for causal-use support. Coordinates with `E.23` when a repeated quality-improvement loop is enacted through tool-using Systems: `C.24` carries call plans, checkpoint returns, tool-call budgets, stop or replan conditions, and the separation among exact Method, `CallRouteDescription`, call plan, executed Work, CallGraph evidence, and service promise; it does not restate the `E.23` loop method, BLP comparison and cost discipline, or other object-under-improvement evaluations carried by their direct patterns. Coordinates with `E.10.MOVE`, `E.11.PUR`, and `A.15.5` when source wording about a move is not plan-local `nextPlannedAction` or `recommendedNextAction`. Constrains: any `U.PromiseContent` used as a tool MUST expose acceptance conditions and observation hooks sufficient for `B.3` reporting. Enables: human-facing Working-Model publication forms with policy and assurance disclosures while keeping design-time and run-time separated.
