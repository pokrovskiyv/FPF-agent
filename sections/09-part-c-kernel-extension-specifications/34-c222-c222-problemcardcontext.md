## C.22.2 - ProblemCard@Context

> **Type:** Calculus (C)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

**Plain-name.** Context-bound problem card.

**Intent.** Give a practitioner one compact problem-side record that turns a messy problem signal into a reviewable problem-side record before downstream Principles-to-Work (P2W) or selector use, while leaving claims outside the card to the governing FPF patterns that govern those claims.

**Use this when.** Use this pattern when work starts from a signal, anomaly, drift, risk, hypothesis, stakeholder demand or concern, set-derived candidate, underused capability, new constraint, new environment, opportunity-like cue, or solution-shaped request, and downstream task typing, method-family selection, work planning, evidence use, gate passage, autonomy control, or P2W requires a reviewable problem-side record. Also use it when P2W would otherwise use a slogan, wish, ticket-shaped task, preselected work request, or solution-shaped task as if it were reviewable problem-side output.

**Do not use this when.** Use another pattern directly when the question under repair is already work planning, method selection, evidence, provenance, assurance, gate decision, autonomy, archive, selected-set governance, mathematical-lens use, or ordinary discussion with no project-side move.

**Builds on.** `E.2`, `E.9`, `E.10`, `C.2.P`, `A.6.P`, `C.16.Q`, `C.16`, `A.19`, `C.22`, `C.25`, `C.29`, `G.5`, `G.9`, `A.6.3.RT`, and `A.6.4`.

**Coordinates with.** `C.11`, `C.18`, `C.19`, `C.22.1`, `C.24`, `C.27`, `C.28`, `A.15`, `A.15.5`, `A.21`, `E.16`, `G.6`, `G.11`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `E.17`, `E.17.ID.CR`, `A.6.3`, `F.9`, `E.18`, `C.32.P2S`, and `E.10.MOVE`.

**Boundary summary.** `C.22.2` use starts from messy problem-side signals and yields one reviewable `ProblemCard@Context`, a `P2W-ready` problem-side input for downstream `C.22`, or a stop with a governing-pattern cue for the claim being made, relation, or boundary outside the card.

### C.22.2:1 - Problem Frame

A working team can reach the beginning of development with symptoms, anomalies, stakeholder signals, constraints, risks, old solution evidence, comparison ideas, solution temptations, underused capabilities, new environments, and opportunity-like cues. Opportunity-like signals still need context, scope cut, not-wish reason, improvement or acceptance probe, and honest next use; they do not turn this pattern into an ideation pattern. If FPF only says "type the task" or "choose a method", P2W can start from a slogan, a ticket-shaped wish, or a solution-shaped task before the problem itself is reviewable.

Problematization becomes useful for FPF use when it makes the problem side explicit. A reviewable problem-side record includes symptom detection, improvement check, acceptance probe or candidate acceptance criterion, mandatory constraints, risk condition, problem-formulation follow-up reason, validation boundary, freshness or expiry, and a relation to candidate solution search. Many problems also arrive from a retained set: candidates, anomalies, hypotheses, non-dominated fronts, shortlists, selected sets, `LivePool` records, and retained stepping stones.

Current FPF already has patterns for archive, pool, front, selected set, parity, refresh, method selection, evidence, autonomy, gate, representation transition, bridge, and mathematical-lens use. The missing piece is a compact problem-side output that lets a practitioner see what is present before P2W use starts from the problem-side output and which current FPF pattern carries each heavier question.

The first-minute working question is:

> Can I write or review a problem-side record that is specific enough to guide P2W, selection, acceptance, evidence, and first-principles or mathematical-lens use, while keeping archives, fronts, pools, selected sets, parity, evidence, autonomy, and work planning in their existing FPF patterns?

### C.22.2:2 - Thin First Use and Output Kind

#### C.22.2:2.1 - Thin First-Use Form

The first substantive use of this pattern is the Thin form. It is a practitioner-facing prompt for writing the smallest reviewable problem card, not a demand to complete a field list.

A `ProblemCard@Context` is complete for its current use when it states:

1. why this signal matters now;
2. what problem representation is being carried under which context and scope;
3. why this is not merely a wish, ticket, slogan, or preselected work request;
4. what would count as improvement or an acceptance probe;
5. what the honest next use is.

The Thin form asks for:

- the problem signal or selected-problem cue: what made the practitioner stop before downstream task typing or work selection;
- context grounding and scope cut, including what is outside the current problem;
- the reason this is not merely a wish, slogan, ticket, or preselected work request;
- a provisional improvement check or acceptance probe;
- one honest next use: `P2W-ready`, characterize, compare, search, refresh, retire, archive, `abstainOrNoChange`, or apply the FPF pattern governing the named claim kind, relation kind, or boundary that changes the problem-card use.

If the Thin form lacks an improvement check or acceptance probe, it may preserve the signal and choose characterization, comparison, search, refresh, retirement, archive, `abstainOrNoChange`, or governing-pattern application for the claim being made; the Thin form does not declare `P2W-ready`.

Only after the Thin form is legible, recover the output-kind boundary:

`C.22.2 - ProblemCard@Context` is the compact problem-side output under current `C.22`.

`C.22.2 - ProblemCard@Context` is the pattern heading. `ProblemCard@Context` is the `C.22.2` problem-side record shape; an instance is a reviewable problem-side record before P2W. `ProblemCard@ContextRef` may be used as a reference form when downstream text cites such an instance, but it is not a separate durable kind unless a separate naming or kind decision approves one under `F.18` and `A.6.P`. The Tech heading remains `C.22.2 - ProblemCard@Context`. Plain-register glosses or section-local practitioner labels may appear in this pattern, but those labels do not replace the Tech heading.

Local labels in this pattern are local to the `C.22.2` record shape unless a separate accepted FPF naming or kind decision assigns them a broader FPF kind. This includes `problem-formulation follow-up reason`, `validation boundary`, `risk condition`, `solvability band`, `P2W-ready`, `reviewable`, `stale`, `refreshed`, `retired`, `archived`, `abstainOrNoChange`, and `firstPrinciplesCue`; they do not create FPF kinds, gate statuses, state-machine kinds, or local mathematical-lens kinds or relations. When a claim outside `C.22.2` is current, do not mint a local reference field for it; name the governing FPF pattern, claim kind named by value, project-side reference when known, and stop condition in the next use or local cue. When a mathematical or first-principles cue is current, cite `C.29`; local `problem-formulation follow-up reason` names only why the problem formulation or structure cue is worth reviewing or moving onward from `C.22.2`; `C.29` carries mathematical-lens use and the problem-formulation follow-up reason for that lens.

Use `E.10.MOVE` only when move-like wording is no longer recoverable as this local problem-card disposition and begins to hide pattern-use recommendation, work-entry readiness, performed work, gate, transformation, source relation, architecture, call-planning, or another directly governed value.

Reference labels ending in `Ref` are reference roles, not kind names. This includes `ProblemCard@ContextRef`, `setContextRef`, `rivalProblemFormulationRef`, and `representationOrWordingUseRelationRef`; do not shorten or promote them into local kind names such as `ProblemCardRef`, `SetContext`, `RivalFrame`, or `RepresentationRelation`.

`@Context` means that the card is bound to declared context grounding: a named `U.BoundedContext`, a project-side context reference, or an explicitly bounded practice situation with recoverable local meaning. Domain or practice wording may identify the informative locus of the problem, but it does not replace context grounding. A broad label such as healthcare, education, engineering, research, or operations is not context grounding by itself. When domain or practice wording is used for context grounding, recover the named bounded context, project-side context reference, or explicit bounded practice situation and state what local meaning or rule is being used. The card does not assert global problem identity outside that declared context grounding.

Plain gloss for `P2W-ready`: problem-side input ready. It means ready as input to downstream P2W or selector reasoning, not ready for work execution, gate passage, or method selection.

When a downstream reader asks whether intended work can enter a work boundary, the problem card may supply problem-side cues, acceptance probes, constraints, and freshness conditions, but the readiness relation itself is `WorkEntryReadiness@Context` under `A.15.5`. `C.22.2` does not decide full-kit preparation, commitment disposition, launch gate, or performed work.

#### C.22.2:2.2 - Required Solution Use

The `C.22.2` Solution is organized around turning observed problem-side signal material into a reviewable problem-side record and one governed next use, not around schema completion.

1. Capture the symptom, anomaly, risk, stakeholder cue, drift, hypothesis, or other observed signal before naming the problem.
2. Stabilize the cheap problem-side record: context grounding, scope cut, EntityOfConcern when it changes the problem-side use, primary viewpoint or role concern, and provisional problem framing.
3. Make action possible by separating the symptom detector, improvement check, candidate acceptance criterion, optimization objective when current, monitored risk signal when current, and proxy-distortion risk when an indicator can be gamed or substitute for value; then state mandatory constraints, risk condition when current, and intended downstream use before downstream selection.
4. Pay only for current complexity: add conditional fields only when their kind is current for the problem-card use; otherwise stop at the lighter card or name the governing FPF pattern to use next and the claim kind named by value.
5. Run the representation-continuity check: if the problem formulation changes the EntityOfConcern, representation scheme, diagram, functional description, or transformation-flow path interpretation, name the representation-transition, retargeting, bridge, structural-reinterpretation, or wording-use relation before reusing an inherited local cue or readiness disposition.
6. Close by the honest next use rather than by a completed form. A filled card without a truthful next use is not a successful `C.22.2` result.

Cheap-stop rule: the smallest card that gives a truthful next use is sufficient. A conforming `C.22.2` use does not require heavier fields merely because the full field list exists.

First practitioner use before governing-pattern cues:

1. Capture the problem signal or selected-problem cue, context grounding, and scope cut.
2. State why it is not merely a wish, slogan, ticket, or preselected work request.
3. State the provisional improvement check or acceptance probe.
4. Choose the honest next use.
Use the relation boundary aid only when a conditional relation is current.

This is the Thin-form writing order, not a completion sequence for the whole pattern. It adds no fields; it keeps the practitioner on the smallest truthful card before Standard or High-relation material is paid for.

#### C.22.2:2.3 - Relation Boundary Aid

Use this aid only after the Thin `ProblemCard@Context` is legible: signal, context grounding, scope cut, not-wish reason, improvement check or acceptance probe, and honest next use. It is not a second writing order and not a catalogue of other patterns. It answers one question:

> Which claim being made, relation, or boundary changes the problem-card use, and which FPF pattern governs that claim, relation, or boundary?

If the claim, relation, or boundary does not change the current problem-card use, leave it out of the card. If it does change the move, keep only the local cue or reference that makes the card reviewable, then apply the governing pattern for that claim, relation, or boundary.

| Current claim, relation, or boundary that changes the card use | Local `ProblemCard@Context` content | Governing pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Characterization, measurement, indicator, Q-bundle, comparison, acceptance, or parity | Characterization cue, acceptance probe, candidate criterion, comparator cue or window cue, and the current reason the relation changes the problem formulation. | `C.16`, `A.19`, `C.25`, `G.0`, `G.4`, or `G.9` according to the relation named by value. |
| Archive, pool, front, shortlist, selected set, retained candidate, or set-return source | `setContextRef`, source-set kind, selection or retention criterion, budget or window when current, and non-scalar next use. | `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.5`, `G.9`, `G.11`, `A.6.P:7a`, or `C.16.Q` according to the relation named by value. |
| Method family, work planning, work-entry readiness, performed work, result record, evidence, provenance, assurance, gate, or autonomy | Problem-side cue, source reference when it changes formulation, and stop condition before that outside use. | `G.5`, `A.15`, `A.15.5`, `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `A.21`, or `E.16` according to the claim named by value. |
| Temporal, causal-use, representation-transition, retargeting, bridge, structural-reinterpretation, or wording-use relation | Relation reference plus the inheritance boundary: what can be reused from the old card and what relation is reopened. | `C.27`, `C.28`, `A.6.3.RT`, `A.6.4`, `E.17`, `F.9`, `E.18`, or `E.10` according to the relation named by value. |
| First-principles or mathematical structure cue | Candidate structure, preserved and lost structure when current, practical payoff for problem formulation, problem-formulation follow-up reason, and stop condition. | `C.29` for mathematical-lens use; `A.6.0` for a `FormalSubstrate` `U.Signature` declaration when that signature declaration is current. |
| Agentic safe probe or world-affecting next action | Probe need, risk condition, bounded next action, and the safety named by value, autonomy, gate, work, evidence, or assurance claim kind that blocks local action. | `C.24`, `E.16`, `A.21`, `A.15`, `A.10`, `G.6`, or `B.3` according to the relation named by value. |

Over-capture symptom: the practitioner spends the pattern use classifying FPF patterns while the problem signal, context, scope, improvement check, acceptance probe, and next use remain unstable.

Repair: return to the Thin problem-side action. State the signal, context, scope, why this is not merely a wish, ticket, slogan, or preselected work request, the improvement check or acceptance probe, and the honest next use. Reopen this aid only for the claim, relation, or boundary that changes that move.

#### C.22.2:2.4 - Use Boundaries and Record Budgets

Use `C.22.2` when a signal is not yet a problem-side record and downstream task typing, P2W, method-family selection, work planning, evidence use, gate passage, autonomy control, or selected-set use depends on such a record. A known method does not close this pattern when the problem signal, scope, acceptance probe, or EntityOfConcern remains unstable.

Use another pattern directly when the question under repair is already that pattern's `EntityOfConcern` or governed relation: `A.15` for work planning or performed work; `A.10`, `G.6`, or `B.3` for evidence, provenance, or assurance; `A.21` for gate decision; `E.16` for autonomy; `C.11` for a local choice among explicit options; and `C.18`, `C.19`, or `G.5` for archive, pool, front, or selected-set governance. `C.22.2` may still preserve the problem-side cue or reference that explains why that pattern is now current.

Use record budgets:

- Thin record budget: signal, context grounding, scope cut, not-wish, not-slogan, not-ticket, or not-preselected-work reason, provisional improvement check or acceptance probe, and one honest next use.
- Standard record budget: Thin fields plus the current comparison, acceptance, risk, validation, freshness, unknown-handling, or P2W-readiness fields needed for downstream use.
- High-relation record budget: Standard fields plus only the relation references needed when public, disputed, high-risk, set-derived, cross-context, evidence-adjacent, autonomy-adjacent, gate-adjacent, agentic, temporal, causal, representation, or Part-G relations are current.

Stop at Thin when it gives a truthful next use. Stop at Standard when it is enough to emit or bind a minimal `TaskSignature`, `TaskKind`, or `ProblemProfile`. Apply the governing FPF pattern for the claim being made, relation, or boundary instead of enlarging the card when the issue under repair is no longer the problem-side record itself.

#### C.22.2:2.5 - Field Labels and Current-Use Conditions

The first problem-side use is to make one problem usable before P2W by stating these field labels when they are current for the case:

- problem signal;
- problem signal reference: prior solution-use evidence, environmental drift observation, new constraint, new environment, underused capability, opportunity-like cue, risk signal, anomaly, hypothesis, stakeholder signal, accepted local theory, or safe-probe or environment cue;
- domain or practice locus when helpful, plus the context grounding that carries local meaning;
- EntityOfConcern or project-side FPF kind or reference named by value when it changes the problem-side use;
- context grounding;
- primary viewpoint or role concern;
- scope cut;
- symptom detection;
- problem hypothesis or cause-theory cue;
- rival-frame reference when multiple plausible problem frames remain current;
- improvement check;
- comparison-and-acceptance cue or acceptance-criterion reference;
- characterization relation;
- characteristic or Q-bundle relation;
- indicator selection;
- comparability or parity relation, or explicit current reason it is not needed;
- mandatory constraints;
- risk condition;
- problem-formulation follow-up reason;
- validation boundary;
- freshness or expiry condition;
- unknown handling;
- `setContextRef` when a set, pool, front, archive, shortlist, selected set, or portfolio context is current;
- `firstPrinciplesCue` for a first-principles or mathematical structure cue that changes problem formulation;
- governing-pattern cue when a claim outside `C.22.2` changes the problem-card use: governing pattern for that claim, relation, or boundary; claim kind named by value; project-side reference when known; and stop condition;

Field current-use conditions for `C.22.2` are determined as follows:

| Field current-use class | Required treatment |
|---|---|
| Always-core problem-card identity fields | State the problem signal or selected problem cue, context grounding, EntityOfConcern when it changes the problem-side use, scope cut, and the current reason this is not just a wish, slogan, ticket, or preselected task. |
| Conditional fields | State problem signal reference, domain or practice locus when helpful plus the context grounding that carries local meaning, viewpoint or role concern, symptom detection, problem hypothesis or cause cue, rival-frame reference when multiple plausible frames remain current, improvement check, comparison-and-acceptance cue or acceptance-criterion reference, characterization or comparability relation, characteristic or Q-bundle relation, indicator selection and indicator role, mandatory constraints, risk condition, problem-formulation follow-up reason, validation boundary, freshness or expiry, unknown handling, `setContextRef` or set-finding cue, first-principles cue, and representation-transition, retargeting, bridge, structural-reinterpretation, or wording-use relation reference when that relation affects reviewability. |
| Governing-pattern cue | When a claim, relation, or boundary outside `C.22.2` changes the card's next use, state only the local cue or reference needed by the problem card, plus the governing pattern and claim kind named by value to use next. The named pattern carries the outside use. |

Field absence rule: if a conditional field kind is not current, the field is absent, not `unknown`. Use `unknown` only for a current field whose value is currently unknown. If a current value is unavailable, state whether the next use is blocked, degraded, sandboxed, or requires the FPF pattern governing the named claim kind before that use. If a value is stale, use the freshness or expiry disposition in `C.22.2:12` and `G.11`. If a field is intentionally omitted, state the record-budget reason and do not imply that the omitted kind has been checked. A minimal `ProblemCard@Context` contains the always-core fields; conditional fields are added only when current for the problem-card use.

When the card compares options, selected-set members, retained candidates, or rival problem formulations, it states the current comparison or parity relation, or state why comparison is not current for the current move. Absence of a parity relation is not automatically a defect; it is a disposition. The governed result is either parity not current for the current card, or a `G.9`-governed parity relation before `P2W-ready` is claimed. A local fair-comparison result or selected-set result stays outside `C.22.2`.

A conforming `C.22.2` use includes minimal witness material and context witness material when source material, source relation, set, selection, characterization, parity, freshness, representation relation, or wording-use relation is current. Otherwise a Thin card may cite the observed signal in plain form. The field-group label `problemCardWitnessRefs` may be used inside the pattern, but it is not a new FPF kind and not an evidence graph. It is a recoverability field group for problem signal references and project-side references that make the problem-side record reviewable:

```text
problemCardWitnessRefs:
  problemSignalRef?
  setContextRef?
  selectionOrRetentionCriterion?
  characterizationRelationRef?
  parityRelationRef?
  freshnessRef?
  representationOrWordingUseRelationRef?
```

Generated problem variants, evaluator feedback, and open-ended problem mutation may be recorded only as `problemSignalRef`, `selectionOrRetentionCriterion`, or `setContextRef` when they make the problem-side record reviewable. They do not make the problem-side record usable, do not supply evidence sufficiency, and do not justify probe or action.

#### C.22.2:2.6 - Anti-Pattern Checks and Worked Slices

Anti-pattern checks start from the local card use:

- card-as-executable-work request: the card is treated as executable work while method, plan, and work occurrence remain undecided;
- form-completion: every field is filled because the template exists, even though the Thin next use would be truthful;
- readiness shortcut: `P2W-ready` is declared from signal and scope alone, without improvement check or acceptance probe;
- source-claim shortcut: a preselected solution, work request, proof-looking reference, gate-looking cue, or authority-looking cue replaces the problem-side signal, context, scope, acceptance probe, and next use;
- scalar shortcut: archive, set-return, Goldilocks, NQD, OEE, partial-order, stepping-stone, or indicator material collapses into one readiness score;
- prestige shortcut: first-principles or mathematical wording is kept without practical payoff, preserved and lost structure when current, problem-formulation follow-up reason, and stop condition.

Local stop rule: if the encountered material tries to carry a claim outside `C.22.2`, the card keeps only the cue or reference that changes problem formulation or the next use, then names the governing FPF pattern and claim kind named by value to use before that claim is relied on.

A conforming `C.22.2` use is testable against at least one Thin worked slice, such as repeated task rework or another compact problem signal, showing signal, context, not-preselected-work reason, improvement check, and next use. It is also testable against at least one High-relation worked slice from a set, archive, pool, front, shortlist, selected set, or portfolio context, showing `setContextRef`, candidate acceptance criterion, risk condition, and the claim being made, relation, or boundary without creating a local portfolio or archive kind.

#### C.22.2:2.7 - Conformance Checklist Requirements

The checklist protects a completed or reviewed card from overread. It is not the writing order and not a gate. The writing order remains Thin form, honest next use, and relation references only when they change the move.

| Check | Required test |
|---|---|
| Name and kind identity | The pattern output is `ProblemCard@Context`: a compact problem-side record shape under `C.22`; it is not a downstream selector record, work record, evidence record, gate record, or autonomy record. |
| Core card identity | The card states signal, context grounding, scope cut, EntityOfConcern when it changes the action, and the reason the record is not merely a wish, slogan, ticket, or preselected work request. |
| `P2W-ready` reason | `P2W-ready` appears only with an improvement check or acceptance probe and a downstream P2W or selector-facing use. It means problem-side input ready, not downstream readiness. |
| Field-budget discipline | Conditional fields appear only when current. A missing relation is absent, not `unknown`; `unknown` is used only for a current value whose absence changes the next use. |
| Governing-pattern cue | Claims outside `C.22.2` are recorded only as local cues or references when they change the card. The next use names the governing pattern and claim kind named by value for that use. |
| External or local wording | External terms such as passport, rule-of-choice card, evidence pack, autonomy budget, logs, gates, portfolio, or factory wording are recovered by use. They become problem-card content only when they supply problem-side signal, set, characterization, comparison, or follow-up material. |
| Scalarization and proxy guard | Goldilocks, NQD, OEE, set-return, partial-order, stepping-stone, priority, or visible indicator wording does not become one local readiness score or value proxy. |
| Currentness and lowering | Freshness, expiry, changed representation, retargeting, evidence change, redress, or unknown-blocked use states refresh, retirement, bounded use, `abstainOrNoChange`, or the relation named by value that is reopened. |
| First-principles and mathematical cue payoff | A first-principles or mathematical cue states practical payoff, preserved and lost structure when current, problem-formulation follow-up reason, and stop condition; `C.29` governs mathematical-lens use. |
| Record-budget invariant | The card is as small as the next use permits. A compact card template, relation aid, or worked example is not a separate FPF kind. |

### C.22.2:3 - Problem-Kind Recovery

For this decision, `problem` remains an ordinary word in non-FPF-governed prose. Recovery is required only when the wording changes a governed use, FPF kind, FPF relation kind, downstream selector reference, evidence claim, causal-use claim, bridge claim, assurance claim, decision claim, use-boundary claim, or another governed claim named by value. The preferred center is the framed problem representation: a problem-side representation of a selected EntityOfConcern under context, scope, viewpoint or role concern, constraints, and improvement or acceptance probe. When `problem` carries FPF work, selection, evidence, causal, bridge, assurance, decision, or use-boundary claim, the claim is recoverable through this table:

| FPF-governed use | Current FPF recovery | `C.22.2` disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Symptom, anomaly, deviation, risk signal, or stakeholder signal | Problem signal or problem signal reference | May trigger a `ProblemCard@Context`, but is not yet a problem-side representation by itself. |
| Problematic situation | Context-bound situation under a viewpoint, domain, constraints, risks, and candidate EntityOfConcern | Captured only through fields that make the situation reviewable. |
| Framed problem representation | Problem-side representation of a selected EntityOfConcern under context and acceptance constraints | Center of `ProblemCard@Context`; representation-change claims apply `A.6.3.RT`, `A.6.4`, `E.17`, `F.9`, or `E.18` when current. |
| Candidate problem in archive or retained candidate pool | Member of a retained candidate set, pool, archive, or front | Must preserve source set or reference, declared set relation when that FPF relation is being made and named by value, retention criterion, budget or window, and review cadence when the retention rule requires it. |
| Selected problem from a set-return treatment | Selected set member or emitted problem-side record under a selection criterion | `ProblemCard@Context` may carry the selected problem, but selected-set semantics remain with `G.5`, `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.9`, `G.11`, `A.6.P:7a`, and `C.16.Q`. |
| Problem ready for selector-facing use | Problem-side record sufficient to emit or bind `TaskSignature` or `TaskKind` | `C.22` uses the typed selector reference; `C.22.2` does not expand `TaskSignature` into a problem-card dump. |
| Downstream task or performed-work cue | Method known enough for task typing, method-family selection, planning, or performed work | Use the selector, work-family, transformation-flow, evidence, provenance, assurance, gate, or decision pattern named by value for that claim. |
| E.8 pattern `Problem frame` | Practitioner-recognition section inside a pattern | Not the C.22 problem-side representation. |
| E.9 DRR `Problem frame` | Decision-rationale section in a design-rationale record | Not the C.22 problem-side representation. |

Local interpretation rule: `ProblemCard@Context` is the problem-side record shape before downstream typing or work. It may name candidate `ProblemProfile`, candidate `TaskSignature`, `setContextRef`, problem-side cue, governing-pattern cue, or first-principles cue material only when those references change the problem-card use. It does not promote those references into local kinds or claims outside `C.22.2`.

### C.22.2:4 - Problem, Task, Method, Work, and Result Split

`ProblemCard@Context` remains usable while the method is unknown, contested, not yet selected, or not yet specific enough for downstream work. A known method does not by itself make the problem ready: if the proposed method is known but the problem signal, scope, acceptance probe, or EntityOfConcern remains unstable, `C.22.2` remains current. If both the problem representation and the method are already accepted and the remaining question is planned execution, apply `A.15`. The card may carry method-family cues and reasons for method search, but it does not present downstream work as already known task execution.

Use this split:

| Term or local name | Current FPF recovery | Local disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `Problem` | Problem-side representation of the selected EntityOfConcern under context | Center of `C.22.2` only after problem-kind recovery. |
| ProblemCard@Context | Compact problem-side record before P2W | `C.22.2`-governed record shape under `C.22`; stabilizes a problem-side representation under declared context. |
| ProblemProfile | C.22-facing `ProblemProfile` prepared or bound from a problem-side representation when sufficient | Downstream `ProblemProfile` reference; not the card itself and not a work request. |
| `TaskKind` | Selector-facing task kind in `C.22` | Downstream typed selector reference; not a work-plan entry. |
| `TaskFamilyRef` | Reference to a family of task kinds or method-consumption classes | Used only when current `C.22` selector logic requires it. |
| `TaskSignature` | Minimal selector-facing signature for eligibility, acceptance, and selection | May be emitted or bound from `ProblemCard@Context`; stays minimal. |
| Method-family selection claim | Comparison or selection among method families | Governing pattern `G.5`; not a problem-card field. |
| `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription` | Method and method description | Governing pattern family `A.15` and related method-description anchors. |
| `U.WorkPlan`, `SlotFillingsPlanItem` | Planned work and work-plan entry | Governing pattern family `A.15`; not a C.22 task signature. |
| `U.Work` | Performed work | Governing pattern family `A.15`; if the attempted claim is evidence, provenance, or assurance, use `A.10`, `G.6`, or `B.3` for that relation. |
| Result record and result measurement | Evidence, provenance, measurement characterization, assurance, or refresh material according to the attempted claim | Use `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `C.16`, or `G.11` according to the claim kind being made. |

Transition condition: `ProblemCard@Context` may prepare a candidate `ProblemProfile`, bind an existing `ProblemProfile`, emit a candidate `TaskSignature`, or bind a `TaskSignature` only when P2W or selector readiness is declared. If several downstream signatures remain plausible, keep them as candidate signatures instead of binding one chosen `TaskSignature`. When the issue under repair becomes method-family selection, selected method, planned work, performed work, result record, or result measurement, apply the governing FPF pattern for that claim; do not expand the card.

### C.22.2:5 - Relation to C.22

`C.22` remains the foundation for `ProblemProfile`, `TaskKind`, `TaskFamilyRef`, and `TaskSignature`. `ProblemCard@Context` is earlier and more explicit: it explains why this problem, under this context, is usable for P2W, search, comparison, characterization, refresh, retirement, or governing-pattern application.

A `ProblemCard@Context` may prepare a candidate `ProblemProfile`, bind an existing `ProblemProfile`, emit a candidate `TaskSignature`, or bind a `TaskSignature` only when P2W or selector readiness is declared. If several downstream signatures remain plausible, keep them as candidate signatures instead of binding one chosen `TaskSignature`.

This relation does not move problem-card field detail into `TaskSignature`. `TaskSignature` stays minimal for eligibility, acceptance, and selection. Downstream method, work, result, evidence, gate, autonomy, archive, portfolio, and selected-set claims remain with their governing patterns.

### C.22.2:6 - Characterization, Indicators, and Comparability

`ProblemCard@Context` states either a recoverable `characterization relation` and `comparability or parity relation`, or an explicit current reason why the problem can proceed without one.

The heavy content stays with existing FPF patterns:

- `C.16` carries measurement characterization, backing, and comparability discipline;
- `A.19` carries characteristic, scale, unit, polarity, and indicator-use discipline;
- `C.25` carries Q-bundles and quality-like multi-characteristic bundles;
- `G.9` carries parity, comparison-window, comparator, budget, unit, repeatability, and reproducibility pins;
- `G.0` carries comparison-frame and CG-Spec governance;
- `G.4` carries acceptance clauses and threshold predicates;
- `G.5` governs selected-set publication when the problem enters a selected set.

Missing characterization or parity relation is a current disposition. The record applies the characterization, parity, search, or pool pattern when that relation is current instead of pretending the problem is ready for P2W.

The `C.22.2` candidate acceptance criterion separates functional check, constraint compliance, risk or safety boundary, parity or comparison relation, and freshness window when those relations are current. Comparison frame, CG-Spec, or comparability governance is governed by `G.0`. Acceptance clauses and acceptance threshold predicates apply `G.4`; `C.22.2` may name only the needed relation, cue, or reference. Passing a test, improving one observed indicator value, or naming an acceptance phrase is not by itself sufficient for P2W use.

### C.22.2:7 - Source Record-Form Recovery

Source record names are recovered by use, not by label shape. This section prevents source prose from becoming local `C.22.2` subobjects.

| Source form family | `C.22.2` preservation | Governing pattern named by value for outside use |
|---|---|---|
| Problem card, problematization passport, problem-side note, or ordinary problem signal | Carry the problem signal, context grounding, scope cut, improvement check or acceptance probe, and next use. | `C.22.2` governs only the problem-side record shape; downstream selector-facing use remains with `C.22`. |
| Archive, portfolio, palette, front, shortlist, selected set, `LivePool`, set-return, or retained candidate | Preserve `setContextRef`, source-set kind, selection or retention criterion, budget or window when current, and non-scalar next use. | `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.5`, `G.9`, `G.11`, `A.6.P:7a`, and `C.16.Q` according to the relation named by value. |
| Characterization passport, characteristic card, parity plan, comparison note, rule-of-choice card, or acceptance-looking row | Preserve the cue, candidate criterion, comparator cue or window cue, and current reason the relation changes formulation. | `C.16`, `A.19`, `C.25`, `G.0`, `G.4`, `G.9`, or `C.11` according to the relation named by value. |
| Evidence pack, provenance note, assurance row, gate log, autonomy budget, runbook, rollback plan, method selection, work plan, performed-work note, result record, or result measurement | Preserve only the problem-side cue, risk or validation boundary, source reference, and stop condition before that use. | `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `A.21`, `E.16`, `G.5`, `A.15`, `C.16`, or `G.11` according to the claim named by value. |
| Candidate solution, described system, ordinary log, budget, ledger, protocol, plan, pack, or factory wording | Recover the use under repair: problem-side source material, problem-side source relation, selected-set material, work, evidence, gate, or autonomy material, or ordinary example. | Apply the governing pattern for the recovered relation; do not mint a local `C.22.2` kind from the label. |

The repair rule is short: if the source material supplies problem-side material, copy the material into the card's current fields. If it supplies another FPF-governed claim, keep only the local cue and apply the pattern that governs that claim.

### C.22.2:8 - Portfolio, Archive, and Set-Return Treatment

Archive, portfolio, pool, front, shortlist, selected-set, and set-return material remain source and set cues for the current problem-side record. `ProblemCard@Context` preserves `setContextRef`, source-set kind, selection or retention criterion, and the non-scalar next use when current; portfolio and archive governance stays with the named governing patterns and does not become a local problem-card kind.

Archive, portfolio, palette, front, shortlist, ranked shortlist, selected set, `LivePool`, and set-return material remain current source distinctions, but their current FPF governing patterns are already available:

| Source wording | Current FPF pattern or relation | Required problem-card preservation when the corresponding claim is being made |
|---|---|---|
| Problem archive | `C.18`, `C.19`, `A.10`, `G.6` | Preserve source set or reference, retention criterion, candidate status, and provenance relation. |
| Problem portfolio | `G.5`, `C.19`, `G.9`, `G.11` | Preserve selection or retention criterion, budget or window, review cadence, and selected-set or `LivePool` relation. |
| Palette | `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.5` | Preserve candidate-family or option-set interpretation without turning it into evidence or approval. |
| Front | `C.18`, `A.19`, `C.25`, `G.5` | Preserve declared characteristics and non-dominated set interpretation. |
| Shortlist | `G.5`, with `G.9` when comparison pins matter | Preserve selected-set criterion and downstream use. |
| Ranked shortlist | `G.5` only when a declared order is declared | Preserve ranking criterion or narrow to selected set with tie notes. |
| Selected set | `G.5` | Preserve selected-set output, selection pins, and unknown handling. |
| `LivePool` | `C.19` | Preserve pool policy, current treatment, and change trigger. |
| Set-return | `G.5`, `C.18`, `C.16.Q`, declared comparison records | Preserve set-valued result when no total order is declared. |

A singleton problem card is the degenerate case. If it came from a portfolio, front, archive, or pool, the selected problem remains traceable through `setContextRef`: the lightweight reference to the source set kind, source reference, selection or retention criterion, budget or window, review cadence, and pattern reference named by value when current. `setContextRef` is a reference field, not a new `SetContext` kind and not a downstream claim carrier.

`setContextRef` preserves the recoverable set-source relation when current: `Palette`, `Front`, `Archive`, `ExplorationArchive`, `Shortlist`, `RankedShortlist`, `SelectedSet`, `LivePool`, or another accepted source-set form. If the set-source relation is not recoverable, the card may keep a set-finding cue, but it does not claim selected-set readiness or archive-derived readiness.

When multiple plausible problem formulations remain current, `C.22.2` does not bind one `TaskSignature` prematurely. Each optional `rivalProblemFormulationRef` states the rival formulation, EntityOfConcern, context, preserved concern, lost concern, reason not selected yet, and next discrimination action. It is not a `CG-Frame`, not the E.8 `Problem Frame`, and not a representation-frame kind.
The next discrimination action may be to characterize, compare, retarget, reopen the source material or source relation, choose a local problem formulation, or apply the relation-bearing pattern. Reframing is triggered when context grounding, EntityOfConcern, viewpoint, scope cut, or cause-theory cue changes the problem representation enough that readiness or use-boundary cannot be inherited by wording continuity.

### C.22.2:9 - Goldilocks and Set-Return Docking

Goldilocks problem selection is the problem-side adaptation of the current NQD, OEE, and set-return family. It is not direct QD or OEE vocabulary import, not a new scalar readiness doctrine, not a local QD or OEE vocabulary, and not a single score. `C.22.2` does not mint `GoldilocksProblem`, `GoldilocksScore`, `GoldilocksReadiness`, or any equivalent local kind; Goldilocks remains a readiness and selection interpretation carried by current governing patterns.

A Goldilocks, stepping-stone, or archive-derived problem is represented as source context or set context, selection or retention criterion, and current next use, not as problem difficulty, priority, or readiness score.

`ProblemCard@Context` carries only the problem-side readiness fields and relation references:

- source set kind when archive, pool, front, shortlist, selected set, or portfolio language is current;
- solvability band;
- characteristic-space, declared problem-side characteristic descriptor, or Q-bundle relation;
- declared difference criterion when novelty or diversity is claimed, or apply the governing characterization or comparison pattern;
- non-scalar trade-off, dominance, partial-order, or set-return relation when that relation is being made;
- measurability or explicit unknown handling;
- reversibility or containment for safe probing when current;
- stepping-stone option value when retention matters;
- expiry or refresh condition;
- selected-set, archive, pool, front, or parity relation when that relation is being made.

The local `solvability band` label means a context-bound, non-scalar interpretation of feasible-but-not-trivial fit under current capability, constraints, validation boundary, and optional set-return relation. It is not a universal difficulty claim, not a hidden readiness scale, and not a single-score ranking.

If the band cannot be tied to a characteristic, Q-bundle, comparison, retention, or capability-context cue, treat Goldilocks wording as informal recognition only and bind any selection, set-return, or parity claim to the governing FPF pattern for that claim.

The current governing family is `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.5`, `G.9`, `G.11`, `A.6.P:7a`, and `C.16.Q`. The relation to `C.22:14` is a role and timing relation inside the same family: `C.22.2` uses the family before P2W, while `C.22:14` uses it downstream when candidate solutions for a `TaskKind` make `TaskSignature` informative.

### C.22.2:10 - Structure Cue That Improves Formulation

`C.29` carries mathematical-lens use for first-principles or mathematical structure cues used by `ProblemCard@Context`.

`firstPrinciplesCue` is a local cue label for a formulation-changing structure and a cue to apply `C.29`; it is not a local mathematical-lens kind or a substitute for a `C.29` lens-use result.

The problem card may ask whether a first-principles or mathematical structure helps find or improve the problem formulation, not only whether an already-mentioned mathematical expression helps the problem formulation. Useful cues include state space, graph, boundary, topology, symmetry, invariant, variational or constrained-optimization structure, probability or information structure, resource bound, obstruction, scale window, composition, or coarse-graining choice.

The practitioner-facing use is:

> State the structure that improves the problem formulation, the preserved structure, the lost structure, the practical payoff, the problem-formulation follow-up reason, and the stop condition.

Distribution by principles:

| Source-side cue | Current FPF pattern or relation | `C.22.2` use |
|---|---|---|
| Zero-principles and first-principles invariants, constraints, symmetry, composition, multi-scale description, variational structure, probability or information, and resource limits | `C.29`, with `A.19`, `C.16`, `C.25`, and `G.9` when characteristics, measurement characterization, quality bundles, or parity are current | Carry a first-principles or mathematical structure cue and apply the governing pattern for the claim being made, relation, or boundary. |
| Second-principles method-family implications | `G.5`, `A.15`, `E.18`, `A.19` as applicable | Name the method-family cue; do not perform method selection in the problem card. |
| Third-principles reproducibility, checks, templates, records, logs, rollback, evidence | `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `A.21`, `G.11`, `E.16` as applicable | Name the reproducibility or evidence cue and apply the governing pattern for the claim kind named by value before relying on that claim. |

When no useful mathematical structure survives, record that absence and proceed without forcing mathematical prose into the problem card.

### C.22.2:11 - Validation, Reliance, AI-Agent Cues, and Safe Probing

`ProblemCard@Context` exposes three local fields for downstream use:

- problem-formulation follow-up reason: why this formulation is worth keeping, reviewing, discriminating, or moving onward now;
- validation boundary: what has been checked for the current next use, what may be used now, and which use is governed by another pattern;
- risk condition: the monitored risk, cost-of-error concern, or containment concern that may change the safe next action.

Use these fields to state a local reliance disposition, not to authorize downstream action.

| Card-use condition | Local disposition | Next pattern application |
|---|---|---|
| The current reason is sufficient for the named reversible P2W use. | `P2W-ready` only for that named use, with validation boundary, context, window, and stop condition. | Apply measurement, evidence, temporal, refresh, representation, gate, autonomy, work, or assurance patterns only when those claims are part of the use. |
| The reason is useful but narrower than the attempted use. | Narrow the attempted use; name the narrowed use, blocked attempted use, and stop condition. | Apply the governing pattern for the missing claim, relation, or boundary. |
| Source material, source relation, validation, or currentness is stale, conflicted, uncalibrated, or untied to the current relation. | Choose `abstainOrNoChange`, `refresh`, or `reopen`; name the missing relation, evidence-needed cue when current, and decision point. | Use `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `C.16`, `C.27`, `G.11`, `A.6.3.RT`, `A.6.4`, `E.17`, `F.9`, or `E.18` according to the reopened relation. |
| The proposed next action can affect the world, spend resources, call tools, delegate to agents, change operational state, or make safety, release, gate, or work claims. | Block local use or name the governing relation; keep only the problem-side cue inside the card. | Apply `B.3`, `A.21`, `E.16`, `A.15`, `A.10`, `G.6`, or `B.2.5` when the corresponding controlled-EntityOfConcern relation is current. |

Cause-theory cues may focus problem formulation inside `ProblemCard@Context`. Association, intervention, counterfactual, responsibility, expected-effect, or causal-evidence claims are governed by `C.28` plus evidence, provenance, or assurance patterns when those claims are being made.

Environment design and safe probing may appear as problem signal reference, validation boundary, risk condition, or governing-pattern cue. If the next action can affect a controlled EntityOfConcern, the card names the probe need plus the claim kind named by value that blocks local action; any deontic permission, work authorization, release authorization, or gate passage stays with the governing pattern for that claim.

### C.22.2:12 - Freshness, Expiry, and Unknown Handling

`C.22.2` includes a section-local state and disposition vocabulary for `ProblemCard@Context`; this vocabulary is not a new FPF kind. These labels describe the card's current governed use; they are not required states in a transition sequence, event kinds, or gate records. The local labels are:

| State or disposition label | Required interpretation |
|---|---|
| `draftSignal` | A problem signal has been captured, but the card is not yet reviewable. |
| `reviewable` | The problem-side record can be inspected, challenged, sent onward, or refined, but it is not necessarily P2W-ready. |
| `P2W-ready` | Local disposition label with plain gloss: problem-side input ready. The problem-side record is sufficient for downstream P2W or selector-facing use; it is not `ReadyForWork`, `GateReady`, `MethodReady`, `AutonomyReady`, or work authorization. |
| governing-pattern cue | A claim, relation, or boundary outside `C.22.2` changes the current problem-card use; the card names the governing FPF pattern and claim kind named by value to use next without claiming that use inside `C.22.2`. |
| `stale` | Freshness or expiry blocks the intended downstream use until refreshed, retired, or otherwise disposed. |
| `refreshed` | The relevant source material, source relation, context, characterization, parity, evidence, provenance, assurance, representation relation, or wording-use relation has been updated enough for the named use. |
| `retired` | The problem-side record is no longer used as a current problem for downstream work. |
| `archived` | The record is retained under the relevant archive, pool, front, or selected-set pattern without being current for P2W. |
| `abstainOrNoChange` | No downstream project-side use is selected because the signal is stale, duplicate, already solved, already absorbed, unnecessary, or not worth current downstream work. |

Freshness names the affected locus: problem signal, context, characterization or parity relation, problem-formulation reason, source material, source relation, set-source reference, representation relation, or wording-use relation. For the problem-signal locus, ask whether the original signal is still present, recurring, solved, absorbed, duplicate, unnecessary, or no longer worth downstream work. For context, ask whether the local context or scope cut has changed enough to alter the formulation. For characterization or parity, ask whether measurement, comparison, and parity relations are current enough for the intended downstream use. For problem-formulation reason, source material, or source relation, ask whether cited sources, provenance, stated reason references, and source references are fresh enough for the problem-formulation follow-up reason. For set-source reference, ask whether archive, front, pool, shortlist, or selected-set membership and the selection or retention criterion are still current. For representation relation or wording-use relation, ask whether wording, diagram, functional description, transformation-flow path, bridge, retargeting, or representation change alters the EntityOfConcern, use-boundary inheritance, context grounding, viewpoint or role concern, scope cut, comparison relation, governed next use, or relation needed for inheritance.

A stale source material, source relation, or evidence reference does not always retire the problem; it may require refresh while the problem remains reviewable. A stale problem signal may lead to refresh, retire, archive, abstain or no-change, or a governing-pattern cue for the claim, relation, or boundary that is checked.

Freshness or expiry failure is a current disposition. A stale or unknown-bearing problem card may remain reviewable as a problem-side record, but it does not become P2W-ready unless freshness and unknown handling permit the intended downstream use. A stale problem card does not silently remain usable as P2W input.

When freshness, expiry, or unknown handling fails, choose one of these current dispositions:

- refresh the problem card or its characterization or comparison relation under `G.11`, `C.16`, `A.19`, `C.25`, or `G.9`;
- retire or deprecate the problem-side record under the relevant archive, pool, selected-set, or refresh pattern;
- continue only as explicitly governed bounded-risk use under the governing pattern for the claim being made, relation, or boundary.

Unknown-handling fields state whether they permit use, require degraded use, abstention, or sandbox treatment, or make the current problem formulation blocked. No P2W, no change, or abstain-for-now may be a successful next use when the signal is stale, duplicate, already solved, already absorbed, unnecessary, or not currently worth downstream work. Before `ProblemCard@Context` emits or binds `TaskSignature`, it checks whether the problem signal is still present and whether prior work has already solved or removed the problem.

### C.22.2:13 - Representation and Wording-Use Relation Continuity

`C.22.2` names `A.6.3.RT`, `A.6.4`, `E.17`, `F.9`, `E.18`, and `E.10` only when changed problem formulations, diagrams, functional descriptions, transformation-flow paths, wording, or `PathSlice` examples carry a current representation, bridge, retargeting, structural-reinterpretation, or wording-use claim. The card may preserve the local cue, reference, or problem-formulation follow-up reason, but it does not prove continuity or use-boundary inheritance by wording similarity.

Framing is not wording repair. A framing change applies when EntityOfConcern, context grounding, scope cut, viewpoint, comparison relation, use-boundary inheritance, or honest next use changes. Wording-use repair is current only when wording, diagram, functional description, transformation-flow path, bridge, retargeting, or representation change alters the carried problem-side representation, EntityOfConcern, use-boundary inheritance, context grounding, viewpoint or role concern, scope cut, comparison relation, governed next use, or governing-pattern cue. Ordinary wording cleanup does not trigger a representation-continuity relation and does not block a Thin `ProblemCard@Context`.

| Pattern or pattern family | When it matters for the card | `C.22.2` use |
|---|---|---|
| `C.22` | Problem-side record, `ProblemProfile`, and `TaskSignature` are being related. | Keep `TaskSignature` minimal and apply representation-transition, bridge, retargeting, structural-reinterpretation, or wording-use patterns only when a current relation claim or use-boundary appears. |
| `C.16`, `A.19`, `C.25`, `G.9`, and `G.11` | Characterization, characteristic, Q-bundle, parity, or freshness representation changes the selected entity or comparison relation. | Preserve only the problem-card cue and apply the characterization, parity, bundle, or refresh relation named by value when that relation is being made. |
| `C.29` | A mathematical representation preserves, coarsens, or retargets the EntityOfConcern or the problem-side representation. | Use `C.29` output and representation or wording-use relation references when structure changes entity interpretation. |
| `C.18`, `C.19`, and `G.5` | Archive, pool, front, shortlist, selected set, method-family, or selected-set output uses transformed representations. | Preserve source-set reference, criterion, and downstream use; keep selection semantics outside the card. |
| `A.6.P`, `C.16.Q`, `E.10`, `E.17`, `F.9`, `E.18`, `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `A.21`, `E.16`, and `A.15` | Source wording, quality wording, multi-view, bridge, structural reinterpretation, evidence, provenance, assurance, gate, autonomy, method, or work relation is current. | Keep the local cue only; apply the governing pattern for the claim being made, relation, or boundary before reusing readiness or relying on the transformed material. |

`C.22.2` may not treat changed-problem examples as governed relations unless the appropriate accepted FPF relation is named.

### C.22.2:14 - Source and P2W Carry-Forward

The source presentation is not compressed into a generic problem-card summary. The following source details become carry-forward constraints for `C.22.2` use and for the P2W-facing relation from `C.22.2`.

| Source detail | Current FPF recovery | `C.22.2` carry-forward relation |
|---|---|---|
| Source examples: person, team, organization, system, community, episteme, and work project | Source-local recognition examples for the domain or practice locus when that locus helps identify problem-card use, and for the EntityOfConcern or project-side FPF kind or reference named by value when it changes the problem-side use; not a new FPF kind taxonomy | `ProblemCard@Context` may state the domain or practice locus when it affects time horizon, indicators, cost of error, role concern, or governed comparison, but it also states the context grounding that carries local meaning. The listed examples are not minted here as a new taxonomy of FPF kinds. |
| Engineering language for reproducibility and management language for coordination, rights, resources, and responsibility | Verification and reproducibility, coordination, right, resource, and responsibility claims are different FPF relations | `C.22.2` may name reproducibility, role, budget, right, or responsibility cue only as a field or relation reference; claims outside the problem-side record stay with their governing patterns. |
| Problem factory, solution factory, and factory-of-factories | Source exposition for three related work families, not FPF process kinds | `C.22.2` covers only the problem-side output. Solution and P2W relations use `G.5`, `A.15`, `E.18`, `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `A.21`, `E.16`, and `G.11`; organizational-development or platform-capability questions are outside this pattern. |
| Characterization protocol: context or slice, compared set, role or viewpoint characteristics, scale, polarity, measurement method, freshness, repeatability, budget, missing data, and comparison rules | `C.16`, `A.19`, `C.25`, and `G.9` governing patterns | `ProblemCard@Context` cites characterization and comparability relation when that relation is being made; it does not treat available measurement as an accepted indicator-use relation. |
| Indicator roles: mandatory constraints, optimization objectives for the current cycle, and risk signals | Characteristic and Q-bundle use under selected comparison or acceptance | `C.22.2` preserves whether an indicator is a mandatory constraint, an optimization objective, or a monitored risk signal when that distinction affects acceptance. |
| Problem portfolio as period-bounded selected set with budget, role assignment, review cadence, and not-selected disposition | `G.5`, `C.19`, `G.9`, `G.11`, `A.6.P:7a`, and `C.16.Q` | `ProblemCard@Context` preserves source set or reference, selection or retention criterion, budget or window, review cadence, and not-selected or stepping-stone disposition when the set-source relation is current. |
| Goldilocks as zone-of-growth selection calibrated to current capability and context | Problem-side entry to current NQD, OEE, and set-return family | `C.22.2` does not turn Goldilocks into one global difficulty scale or scalar readiness score. |
| Stepping stones as option value: new actions, tools, data, interfaces, environments, or experiment modes that may expand downstream search | Retained archive, front, or pool member, or selected-set reason | `C.22.2` may record stepping-stone value only with a governing set-return, archive, or pool pattern and a retention or tie-break criterion. |
| P2W chain: signatures and principles help select formalism, ontology, characterization, and method-family material | `A.6.0`, `A.6.1`, `C.16`, `A.19`, `C.29`, `G.5`, and `E.18` | `C.22.2` supplies problem-side cues and relation references; it does not select the formalism, ontology, mechanism, or method family by itself. |
| P2W chain: condition measurement and comparison help select a concrete method | `C.16`, `A.19`, `C.25`, `G.9`, `G.5`, and `A.15` | State the comparison-and-acceptance cue or acceptance-criterion reference and parity and characterization relations needed by downstream method selection. |
| P2W chain: work planning makes planned work inspectable | `A.15`, `A.15.3`, and `SlotFillingsPlanItem` | `C.22.2` may emit or bind `TaskSignature`, but planned work stays in work-planning patterns. |
| P2W chain: performed work produces work-result records | `A.15`, `A.10`, `G.6`, and `B.3` | `C.22.2` does not treat performed work or result records as problem-card fields beyond problem-side cues or named relation references. |
| P2W chain: result measurement can trigger refresh or return to earlier source material | `C.16`, `G.11`, `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `C.18`, and `C.19` | `C.22.2` states freshness or expiry and unknown-handling dispositions that let downstream result measurement refresh, retire, or re-open the problem-side record. |
| Runbook, rollback plan, canary, SafeStop, error budget, and override protocol | Work, gate, autonomy, evidence, and control records | These source forms are not `C.22.2` subobjects; apply `A.15`, `A.21`, `E.16`, `A.10`, `G.6`, or `B.3` when the corresponding claim is current. |
| Trust debt after reliance-window expiry | Freshness and decay indicator and bounded-risk continuation question | Treat trust debt as an indicator or problem-formulation follow-up reason, not as punishment, proof failure, or gate passage by itself. |

This carry-forward preserves detail, not broader scope. `C.22.2` remains the problem-side output; P2W uses it with enough problem-side cues and project-side references to select method families, plans, performed work, and result measurement without making the problem card a P2W pattern.

### C.22.2:15 - SoTA Decision-Use Source Material

The following external anchors are adopted or adapted only where they change this pattern's local answer by value.

| Current source or relation line | Reference | Pattern use | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Problem framing turns an ill-structured situation into a solvable design problem and requires care because "framing" is ambiguous. | 2025 CEEA paper "Towards a Theoretical Framework of Framing in Engineering Design", `https://doi.org/10.24908/pceea.2025.19713` | Contributes deconfliction of symptom, situation, framed problem representation, and task. | Adopted as field and kind-recovery cue; wording is expressed in current FPF terms. |
| Strategic problem framing distinguishes symptoms and attention allocation from causal problem formulation. | 2025 Organization Science article "Looking at the Trees to See the Forest: Construal Level Shift in Strategic Problem Framing and Formulation", DOI suffix `2024.19134`, `https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2024.19134` | Motivates the fields for problem signal, problem hypothesis/cause-theory cue, and improvement check. | Adapted; causal claims still apply `C.28` plus evidence, provenance, or assurance patterns when current. |
| QD and OEE work motivates collections, fronts, archive retention, set-return, and non-single-winner treatment. | 2026 survey "A survey on Quality-Diversity optimization: Approaches, applications, and challenges", `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650225003979`; QD-as-MOO reference `https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00478` checked 2026-05-20 | Motivates set-source-reference and Goldilocks docking into current `C.18`, `C.19`, `G.5`, `G.9`, `G.11`, `A.6.P:7a`, and `C.16.Q`. | Adopted as field and relation cue; no local QD or OEE vocabulary or scalar readiness score is introduced. |

| External AI-agent and autonomy practice more often makes evidence, log, gate, autonomy-budget, and update-discipline claims current. | Presented material plus current FPF autonomy, evidence, and gate patterns | Motivates governing-pattern assignment for validation, AI-agent cues, and safe probing. | Non-FPF-governed for the center of `C.22.2`; FPF-governed content remains with `E.16`, `A.21`, `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `A.15`, and `G.11`. |

If a `C.22.2` use carries a wider external claim than these dispositions, the claim is outside this pattern and requires a separate content decision or demotion to a non-FPF-governed example.

Each FPF-governed SoTA use is recovered as a local test: source idea, FPF invariant, practitioner check, and popular shortcut rejected. A source citation without that local test is not enough to carry pattern use.

Local SoTA-to-action tests:

| Source or relation cue | Popular shortcut rejected | Required local result | Reopen condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Problem framing is ambiguous and abstraction shifts matter. | Symptom, root-cause story, request, or ticket is treated as the problem. | Recover problem signal, framed problem representation, context and scope, viewpoint or role concern, improvement check, and rival frame when current. | Reopen when context, scope, viewpoint, rival frame, evidence need, or improvement or acceptance probe changes. |
| P2W uses only a reviewable problem-side record. | `P2W-ready` is treated as work authorization, gate passage, method selection, evidence proof, assurance, or selected solution. | State problem-formulation follow-up reason, validation boundary, readiness disposition, P2W use retained here, blocked attempted use, and governing-pattern cue when a claim outside `C.22.2` is current. | Reopen when the signal, context, scope, acceptance probe, problem-formulation follow-up reason, validation boundary, freshness, or named claim outside `C.22.2` changes. |
| QD, OEE, and set-return work produce archives, fronts, pools, and selected sets. | Priority score, single winner, local problem portfolio, or local selected-set claim. | Preserve `setContextRef`, source set kind, selection or retention criterion, and a non-scalar next use; apply the governing set, parity, archive, pool, or refresh pattern when current. | Reopen when the source set, retention criterion, parity relation, archive, pool, front, selected set, budget, window, or freshness disposition changes. |
| Open-ended agents, problem variants, evaluator feedback, and stepping stones change signal interpretation. | Agent output, evaluator trace, or generated variant is treated as enough to act. | Record generator, evaluator, variant, or stepping-stone reason source only as a problem-side cue; name validation, freshness, and pattern reference named by value before probe or action. | Reopen when generator, evaluator, variant, stepping-stone reason source, safety condition, probe condition, or pattern reference named by value changes. |
| First-principles or mathematical structure can improve formulation. | A named formalism or mathematical or ontological prestige is treated as adequacy or rigor. | Record the candidate structure, either its relation to the problem-side EntityOfConcern or the `C.29` mathematical-lens-use relation, preserved and lost structure when current, practical formulation payoff, problem-formulation follow-up reason, and stop condition. | Reopen when candidate structure, preserved or lost structure, problem-formulation follow-up reason, stop condition, or `C.29` result changes. |
| Early class or kind taxonomy looks available. | A class list or ontology-first taxonomy is treated as the problem formulation. | Keep the formulation question current; record candidate structure, preserved and lost structure when current, and representation or retargeting relations before freezing kind structure. | Reopen when formulation question, kind structure, relation, representation-transition relation, or retargeting relation changes. |
| Object model looks clarifying. | Object-model clarity freezes the wrong EntityOfConcern or relation. | Keep EntityOfConcern and relation reviewable; name representation-transition, retargeting, or bridge relation references before reusing a local cue or readiness disposition. | Reopen when EntityOfConcern, relation, view, bridge relation, or representation-transition relation changes. |

### C.22.2:16 - Rationale

`ProblemCard@Context` gives the practitioner one compact problem-side record between vague problem talk and downstream P2W. The card is useful because it is light enough for ordinary use and specific enough to show when comparison, characterization, evidence, selection, mathematical-lens use, method, work, gate, autonomy, bridge, representation transition, or refresh requires another FPF pattern.

The card gives the practitioner one thing to write, inspect, and challenge. A practitioner can see whether a problem is ready without first assembling the problem-side record from `TaskSignature`, Q-bundle, parity report, evidence note, selected-set output, and refresh record. Claims beyond the problem-side record stay with their governing patterns.

The archive and portfolio distinctions remain current when they matter because the card preserves `setContextRef` and names the governing pattern for any current set, archive, or portfolio claim. Changed problem formulations, diagrams, functional descriptions, or transformation-flow path interpretations require the accepted representation or retargeting relations before a local cue or readiness disposition is reused. Current SoTA and first-principles cues matter only when they change fields, relation references, boundaries, or the problem formulation itself.

### C.22.2:17 - Problem-Card Use Invariants

| Invariant | Requirement |
|---|---|
| One card, one current problem-side representation | One `ProblemCard@Context` instance carries one problem-side representation under one declared context. A changed represented problem states the changed representation or the relation that is reopened. |
| `P2W-ready` is problem-side readiness | The card can be ready as input to P2W or selector-facing use without being ready for work execution, gate passage, method selection, evidence use, or autonomy control. |
| Claims outside `C.22.2` stay outside the card | Evidence, provenance, assurance, gate, autonomy, work, archive, selected-set, comparison, acceptance, representation, temporal, causal, and mathematical-lens claims remain with the pattern that governs each claim being made. |
| Stale or blocked cards state a disposition | A stale, unknown-blocked, changed-representation, or missing required reason, criterion, or source-reference card states refresh, retirement, bounded use, `abstainOrNoChange`, or the relation that is reopened. |

### C.22.2:18 - Misuse Modes and Repairs

| Misuse mode | Symptom | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| Card-as-executable-work request | A solution-shaped task or implementation request is treated as a problem-side record. | Recover signal, context, scope, improvement check or acceptance probe, and next use before any work pattern is applied. |
| Content creep | The card starts carrying claims outside the problem-side record. | Keep only the cue or reference needed by the problem-side record and apply the pattern that governs the claim being made. |
| Hidden scalarization | Goldilocks, readiness, priority, OEE, QD, or indicator wording becomes one local score. | Preserve source-set kind, selection or retention criterion, characteristic or Q-bundle relation, and non-scalar next use. |
| Silent retargeting | A changed EntityOfConcern, representation scheme, diagram, functional description, or transformation-flow path interpretation inherits old readiness by wording continuity. | Name the representation-transition, retargeting, bridge, structural-reinterpretation, or wording-use relation before reuse. |
| Refresh dead end | Expiry or unknown handling is recorded as a passive note. | State refresh, retirement, bounded use, `abstainOrNoChange`, or the relation that is reopened. |

### C.22.2:19 - Use-Quality Checks

These checks protect the card's practical use; they do not add fields.

| Check | Quality question |
|---|---|
| Recognition | Can the practitioner recognize the working situation before outside-governed relation material appears? |
| Thin affordance | Can a truthful card fit under one page when only Thin fields are current? |
| Next use | Does the card choose `P2W-ready`, characterize, compare, search, refresh, retire, archive, `abstainOrNoChange`, or the FPF pattern governing the named claim kind, relation kind, or boundary? |
| Record budget | Are heavier fields present only because they change the current move? |
| P2W export | Does the card state what P2W may use now and which governing-pattern cues remain outside the card? |

### C.22.2:20 - Worked Slices and Anti-Cases

#### C.22.2:20.1 - Five-Case Worked Slices

| Case | Problem-side signal | Repaired card use | Boundary preserved |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI and human task transfer rework | Repeated rework appears after transfer between human and agent. | Stabilize signal, context, acceptance probe, and safe-call or work relation before another delegation. | The card is not a prompt retry instruction and does not justify another delegation. |
| Musical mastery tempo drift | Practice tempo drifts away from the intended mastery band. | State the temporal claim, practice context, acceptance probe, and `C.27` relation when tempo, rhythm, recovery, or learning rate changes the next use. | A trend line is not an intervention model or evidence of mastery. |
| Customer-service escalation after a policy or interface change | Escalation volume rises after the change. | Stabilize affected customer hand-off, acceptance probe, risk boundary, measurement relation, and causal-use relation when that relation is being made. | Escalation volume is not an automatic fix request, staffing plan, rollback order, or causal proof. |
| Literature-synthesis anomaly before method selection | An anomaly does not fit current category labels. | Preserve rival formulation, EntityOfConcern, evidence need, bridge, representation, or mathematical-lens relation when that relation is being made, and next discrimination action. | The anomaly is not proof for a new theory or a selected research method. |
| Selected-set candidate before P2W | A retained candidate from a front or pool looks promising. | Preserve `setContextRef`, source-set kind, selection or retention criterion, non-scalar next use, currentness, and window. | Set membership is not selected-solution proof, priority score, or work authorization. |

#### C.22.2:20.1a - Compact P2W-ready Disposition Slice

A support team sees repeated failed hand-offs after a new interface policy. The incoming request says "rewrite the escalation workflow." A conforming `ProblemCard@Context` first repairs the problem-side record instead of accepting the work-shaped request.

| Thin card field | Filled value |
|---|---|
| Source signal | Escalations reopen after hand-off from first-line support to specialist support. |
| Context grounding | `SupportOps@EU`, new interface policy edition, two-week incident window. |
| Problem-side EntityOfConcern | The hand-off ambiguity at the support interface, not the whole escalation process. |
| Improvement check or acceptance probe | Sample reopened cases; accepted improvement means fewer reopened hand-offs in the same context without increasing unresolved safety, compliance, or customer-impact exceptions. |
| Problem-formulation follow-up reason | Separate interface wording, role-method-work alignment, evidence and currentness, and possible policy-boundary relations before any method or work-plan choice. |
| Validation boundary | Same support interface, policy edition, incident window, and source logs; refresh if the policy edition, source logs, context, or acceptance probe changes. |
| Readiness disposition | `P2W-ready` only for the carried problem-side distinction: hand-off ambiguity under a declared interface policy and acceptance probe. |
| Exported governing-pattern cues | `A.6` for policy or interface wording, `A.15` for role-method-work alignment, `A.10` for evidence and currentness, `A.21` only if a gate claim later becomes current. |

The P2W export is narrow: accepted problem-side material, context grounding, improvement check, validation boundary, freshness condition, and governing-pattern cues. If the improvement check or acceptance probe is missing, the card stays reviewable-only or source-finding and cannot claim `P2W-ready`. If the next user wants evidence sufficiency, a gate decision, work authorization, or selected method, the card preserves the cue and the corresponding governing pattern carries that downstream claim.

#### C.22.2:20.2 - Anti-Cases


| Anti-case | Correct result |
|---|---|
| The card is cited as safety acceptance, gate passage, tool-call action invitation, or work authorization. | Apply the safety named by value, gate, autonomy, work, evidence, provenance, or assurance pattern; keep only the problem-side cue in the card. |
| A mathematical phrase is added because it sounds rigorous. | Use `C.29` only when the candidate structure, preserved and lost structure, payoff, follow-up reason, and stop condition are recoverable. |
| A source archive produces a "best" problem by one score. | Use source-set and selected-set patterns; the card carries non-scalar set context and problem-side next use. |

### C.22.2:21 - Machine-Assisted Drafting Boundary

Machine-assisted `ProblemCard@Context` drafting is only a drafting aid. Before the draft is used for P2W or selector-facing work, a practitioner checks the card's local fields and any governing-pattern cues for claims outside `C.22.2`.

Required practitioner checks for a machine-assisted draft:

- problem signal;
- improvement check or acceptance probe;
- problem-formulation follow-up reason;
- unknown handling;
- freshness or expiry disposition;
- governing-pattern cues for claims being made, relations, or boundaries outside `C.22.2`.

### C.22.2:22 - First Practical Entry Aid

This section is a discoverability aid only. It helps a practitioner or assistant find a candidate pattern; it does not prescribe a transition sequence and does not require opening `C.22.2` for every problem-sounding text.

These likely practitioner entry phrases point to `C.22.2`:

- "We have a problem, but it is not yet clear what work should be done."
- "This looks like a ticket, but I am not sure the problem is stated."
- "A signal or anomaly keeps recurring before method selection."
- "We selected this candidate from a front, archive, pool, or selected set, but need to state why it is a problem now."
- "P2W would otherwise use 'implement X' as if it were reviewable problem-side output."
- "There is a symptom, but we do not yet know what to solve."
- "We need to know whether this problem is ready for P2W or should apply another pattern."

Direct-entry cues that are not `C.22.2`:

- accepted method or work planning: use `A.15`;
- proof, provenance, reliability, or assurance claim: use `A.10`, `G.6`, or `B.3`;
- local choice among explicit options: use `C.11`, or `G.5` when set publication or selected-set semantics are current;
- agent tool-call, gate, or autonomy claim: use `C.24`, `E.16`, or `A.21`; `ProblemCard@Context` may only name the problem-side cue or relation named by value;
- ordinary discussion with no downstream project-side use: no `C.22.2` use.

First-use Thin-card test:

Given a messy signal, a practitioner can produce a Thin `ProblemCard@Context` in under one page and correctly choose one governed next use: `P2W-ready`, characterize, compare or parity, search or pool, refresh, retire, `abstainOrNoChange`, or apply the FPF pattern that governs the claim being made, relation, or boundary outside the card.

Entry relation:

The entry relation is local: `C.22.2` is introduced under `C.22`, and `C.22` names the `ProblemCard@Context` relation. The `C.22.2` body carries the Problem frame, first-entry phrases, tempting-wrong-pattern boundaries, and first-use Thin-card test needed for ordinary discovery.

### C.22.2:23 - Downstream Cue Export

`ProblemCard@Context` exports problem-side material, not a claim over downstream use.

The compact export fields are:

- problem signal and context grounding;
- EntityOfConcern and scope cut when they change the move;
- improvement check or acceptance probe;
- readiness disposition: reviewable-only, `P2W-ready`, no-work or `abstainOrNoChange`, refresh, retire, archive, or governing-pattern application cue;
- source-set or representation relation reference when current;
- problem-formulation follow-up reason and validation boundary when P2W relies on the card.

For P2W carry-through, use `E.18.1` with the accepted problem-side material and the current relation named by the card. For selector-facing readiness and candidate `TaskSignature` relation, use `C.22`. For selected-set or search cues, use `G.5` only when that relation is current. For work need, use the A.15 family only after work planning, work-entry readiness, performed work, or work-relevant appearance-based reliance repair is current; `A.15.5` carries `WorkEntryReadiness@Context` when the downstream question is whether intended work is ready enough to enter the work boundary. For any other claim being made, apply the pattern that governs it; do not treat the whole card as carrying that claim.

### C.22.2:24 - Consequences

#### C.22.2:24.1 - Benefits

- FPF gains a clear problem-side output for problematization as the input P2W can use.
- P2W uses a typed problem-side record rather than a slogan, ticket-shaped wish, or preselected method.
- `C.22.2` has practical value for FPF when it reduces at least one expensive failure: a wish enters P2W as `TaskSignature`; a preselected work request is treated as the problem; method selection happens before the problem is reviewable; a problem from a set loses `setContextRef`; an indicator is used without a declared indicator-use relation; problem-formulation follow-up reason is cited as proof; a stale problem remains active; scalar readiness replaces set-return; or the problem-formulation follow-up reason is inherited across a changed representation without the governing representation-continuity or wording-use relation.
- Current archive, pool, front, shortlist, set-return, parity, refresh, evidence, and `C.29` patterns are reused instead of duplicated.
- The positive role of mathematical and first-principles thinking is preserved: it can find missing structure, not only check already-written mathematics.
- Characterization and parity are no longer optional background when they are prerequisites for problem reviewability.
- Representation-change relations are handled through named relation references rather than local proof inside the problem card.

#### C.22.2:24.2 - Costs of Use

- A `ProblemCard@Context` adds a small writing step before P2W. The cost is justified only when the signal is not yet reviewable before downstream use.
- The practitioner keeps the card small: preserve the split between problem, task, method, work, and result; keep `TaskSignature` minimal; and add conditional fields only when their relation is current.
- For problems emitted from archives, pools, fronts, selected sets, or portfolios, the practitioner preserves `setContextRef` or the set-source relation without turning the card into a portfolio, archive, selected-set, or work-planning carrier.
- External or source-local terms may guide recognition only when they change a concrete boundary, field, relation, or validation requirement. Otherwise they remain examples or local cues.

### C.22.2:25 - Relations

- Builds on: `E.2`, `E.9`, `E.10`, `C.2.P`, `A.6.P`, `C.16.Q`, `C.16`, `A.19`, `C.22`, `C.25`, `C.29`, `G.5`, `G.9`, `A.6.3.RT`, and `A.6.4`.
- Coordinates with: `C.11`, `C.18`, `C.19`, `C.22.1`, `A.15`, `A.15.5`, `A.21`, `E.16`, `G.6`, `G.11`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `E.17`, `E.17.ID.CR`, `A.6.3`, `F.9`, `E.18`, `E.18.1`, `C.32.P2S`, and `E.10.MOVE`. Use `C.32.P2S` only when a problem-side record exposes architecture pressure that must continue into selected structures, candidate synthesis, decision, realization, actual-structure feedback, or refresh.

### C.22.2:End
