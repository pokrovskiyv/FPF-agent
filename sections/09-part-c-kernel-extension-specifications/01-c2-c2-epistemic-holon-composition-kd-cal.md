## C.2 - Epistemic holon composition (KD-CAL)

**Scope & exports.** A substrate-neutral calculus for composing **epistemic holons** (`U.Episteme`) and reasoning about their change and equivalence. Exports: (i) three **point-characteristics**—**Formality F**, **ClaimScope G**, **Reliability R**—that locate one exact claim-bearing episteme for a stated use; (ii) a **pairwise ladder** of **Congruence Levels (CL 0…3)**; (iii) four **Δ-moves** (*Formalise, Generalise/Specialise, Calibrate/Validate, Congrue*); (iv) **composition rules** (Γ_epist) for aggregates; and (v) propagation laws for CL through mappings and notation relations. C.2.1 identifies an episteme by its exact claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme` under `EpistemeConstitutionRelation`. Empirical grounding and edition are separate C.2.1 relations. Viewpoint selection and `U.View` conformance use E.17.0; mathematical or diagrammatic representation uses C.29 and A.6.3.RT; publication uses E.17/E.24.PUB; a carrier remains a distinct entity. Every F–G–R computation names the exact claim and its `U.ClaimScope`. If a path changes scope, notation, kind, reference plane, source-local meaning, model-use basis, or evidence basis, it names the actual relation traversed and applies only the loss that relation declares; no generic Context, slot umbrella, or Bridge stands in for those different relations.

**Formality F** is the rigor characteristic defined **normatively in C.2.3**. All KD‑CAL computations and guards **SHALL** use `U.Formality` (F0…F9) as specified there; **no parallel “mode” ladders** are allowed.

### C.2:1 - Problem Frame

FPF fixes two archetypal sub-holons: **`U.System`** (physical/operational) and **`U.Episteme`** (knowledge holon). KD-CAL is the primary composition pattern for `U.Episteme`, giving engineers a compact, testable way to say (a) how strictly an episteme is written (**F**), (b) where its exact claim is asserted to apply (**G**), (c) how well that claim is warranted by evidence or severe tests (**R**), and (d) how closely **two** epistemes coincide (**CL**). C.2.1 supplies the constitution test: exact claim content, one exact EntityOfConcern, and one effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. Grounding, edition, viewpoint, view, representation, publication, form, and carrier remain neighboring objects or relations under their direct patterns.

### C.2:2 - Problem

Teams routinely entangle **programs, specifications, proofs, and datasets**; a “proof” is treated as a tested routine, a “program” is cited as if it entailed a theorem. **Trust decays** because justification and evidence freshness are not explicit. Epistemes are anthropomorphised as actors (“the standard enforces…”), producing **category errors at execution**. Without a shared composition and equivalence calculus, aggregates hide weakest links and analogies harden into overclaims. KD‑CAL must stop these failure modes with a **single constitution and scale‑set**.

### C.2:3 - Forces

* **Universality vs domain idioms.** One calculus must cover physics theories, legal codes, safety specs, algorithms, and formal proofs without flattening their differences.
* **Meaning vs materiality.** Meaning must be independent of carrier, yet accountable to it historically.
* **Deductive vs empirical.** Axiomatic certainty and empirical trust have different evidence-continuity profiles; both must compose.
* **Abstraction vs enactment.** Epistemes constrain action; **systems** act. The calculus must keep the roles distinct.

### C.2:4 - Solution

#### C.2:4.1 - Coordinates, constitution, and neighboring relations

**KD‑CAL characteristics (single‑episteme, point‑values).**

* **Formality F.** From free prose to **machine‑checkable proof/specification**. Litmus: *would a machine reject it if wrong?*
* **Claim scope (G), a set‑valued applicability over `U.ContextSlice`, with ∩/SpanUnion/translate algebra; CL penalties apply to R, not to F/G.** Litmus: *how wide is the declared scope, and under what minimal assumptions does the claim hold?*
* **Reliability R.** From untested idea to **continuously validated claim**. Litmus: *where is the last successful severe test?* **R‑claims MUST bind to evidence and declare relevance windows; stale bindings degrade R or require waiver per ESG policy.**

 **Congruence Level (CL), pairwise ladder.**
 `CL‑0` **Opposed/Disjoint** (contrastive; no substitution); `CL‑1` **Comparable / Naming‑only** (label similarity; no substitution); `CL‑2` **Translatable / RoleAssignment‑eligible** (structure‑preserving mapping in a declared fragment with **stated loss**; theorems may transport); `CL‑3` **Near‑identity / Type‑structure‑safe** (invariants match; type‑structure substitution allowed). *CL is a characteristic of a relation between two epistemes; it is not a fourth member of the F–G–R assurance tuple and it is not a characteristic space of its own.* **Norm:** substitution is permitted only if plane‑preserving and **CL ≥ 2**; substituting **type‑structure** requires **CL = 3**.

**Constitution and neighboring relations.** State F, G, and R for one exact claim of one C.2.1 episteme. Its exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme` identify the episteme through `EpistemeConstitutionRelation`. F characterizes the claim's form; G is the separate `U.ClaimScope`; R relies on exact evaluation, evidence-use, and assurance relations. Empirical grounding and edition remain separate C.2.1 relations. Viewpoint selection and view conformance remain under E.17.0; notation and other representation structure remain under C.29/A.6.3.RT; publication occurrence, form, and carrier remain under E.17/E.24.PUB. Multiple notations are allowed only when their exact representation or notation relation is explicit and any declared loss is applied to R rather than hidden in an omnibus episteme field.

#### C.2:4.2 - Four Δ‑moves (epistemic motion)

* **ΔF — Formalise.** Rewrite for stricter calculi/grammars; raise proof obligations.
* **ΔG — Generalise / Specialise.** Widen or narrow the **claim scope** (assumptions & scope). Changes to decomposition granularity are an **orthogonal view** and do not change **G** unless they alter the envelope.
* **ΔR — Calibrate / Validate.** Strengthen severe tests or add live monitoring; update evidence bindings.
* **ΔCL — Congrue.** Establish and record the sameness relation between **two** epistemes (ladder 0→3).
  Moves compose into **paths**; CL along a path is the **minimum** of its links.

#### C.2:4.3 - Composition (Γ\_epist) and propagation

Let **Γ\_epist** combine epistemes `{Eᵢ}` into a composite episteme **Γ** that makes a joint claim (*AND‑style*) or exposes an interface (*series composition*). KD‑CAL imposes **safe defaults**:

* **R (Reliability).** Along any justification **path** `P`, compute **`R_eff(P) = max(0, min_i R_i − Φ(CL_min(P)))`** (weakest‑link with congruence penalty). For **series** composition (claims needed conjunctively), the path‑wise weakest‑link applies; for **parallel** support (independent lines to the *same* claim), use **`R(Γ) = max_P R_eff(P)`** (annotate independence); never exceed the best attested line. A traversed notation, scope-translation, kind, plane, source-local, model-use, or evidence-reuse relation contributes to `CL_min(P)` only through the loss rule it actually declares.

* **F (Formality).** `F(Γ) = minᵢ F(Eᵢ)` (monotone non‑increasing along used paths). To raise **F**, apply **ΔF** to the weakest parts.
* **G (ClaimScope).** On any dependency **path**, take the **intersection** of claim scopes (the **narrowest overlapping scope**). Across **independent support paths to the same claim**, set **`G(Γ) = SpanUnion({G_path})` constrained by support** (drop unsupported regions). Widening/narrowing the scope is an explicit **ΔG±** operation.
* **CL (Congruence).** For a chain of mappings `E₀ ~ E₁ ~ … ~ Eₖ`, the **path congruence** is `min CL(Eⱼ,Eⱼ₊₁)`. Passing through a **NotationBridge** sets CL to the bridge’s declared level; the **Φ(CL)** penalty is applied in the **R** fold for any path that traverses it.

These rules keep Γ aligned with the **holonic kernel**: Γ is only defined on holons and respects identity/boundary discipline from the core.

#### C.2:4.4 - What **must not** be conflated (normative guards)

* **Representation structure ≠ carrier.** Files, PDFs, or repositories are **carriers** outside the episteme; they never count as parts of `U.Episteme` (**see C.2.1 EP‑1; CC‑EPI‑2/3**).
* **Epistemes do not act.** Only **systems** perform Work. Epistemes carry claim content and can participate in constitution, grounding, edition, description, evidence-use, reliance, viewing, representation, and publication relations under their direct patterns.
* **CL is not a score.** It is a **qualitative ladder** of preservation classes; do not average it.

### C.2:5 - ✱ Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

**Universal rule (tell).** *Compose knowledge by Γ_epist with weakest-link R, monotone F, and explicit CL on every relation that declares it. Identify the episteme by exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective reference scheme; keep empirical grounding, edition, viewpoint selection, view conformance, representation, publication form, publication occurrence, and carrier in their own direct relations.*

**System (show, current physical-system lens).** Consider a **battery-pack thermal subsystem** integrating a physics model of heat flow and an operating envelope for fast-charge. As a **system**, it composes pumps, sensors, and controllers through the system, composition, boundary, state, and dynamics guidance in `A.1`, `A.14`, `A.22`, and `A.3.4`, with conservation constraints made explicit; `B.1.6` and `C.16` govern resource and measurement claims as applicable. Planned `C.1` (Sys-CAL) may later consolidate that guidance, but it supplies no current governing semantics. The assurance story depends on epistemes about the model and envelope; the system **acts**, epistemes constrain. (Archetypes and boundary discipline per core.)

**Episteme (show, KD-CAL lens).** Consider a **CMIP-class climate projection episteme** (post-2015 generation): its exact claim content covers PDEs and parameterisations; its EntityOfConcern identifies what the projection claims concern; and its effective reference scheme supplies the interpretation rules. A separate `U.ClaimScope` names historical forcings, resolution, and assumptions. Any empirical-grounding occurrence names the grounding holon and covered claim subgraph separately. Its representation may include domain equations and a tabular schema linked by an explicit notation or representation relation with stated loss. Compose sub-epistemes for radiation, clouds, and ocean mixing: `R = min` across the critical path; an independent hindcast line can raise `R` only up to its own level; `F` is bounded by the least-formal sub-claim unless the composition adds formal invariants.

### C.2:6 - Bias‑Annotation

* **Metric worship.** Treating `[F,G,R]` as ends rather than means; mitigation: require **evidence bindings** and narrative of limits in the claim scope and grounding envelope.
* **Category slip.** Equating a notation, view, publication form, or carrier with claim content, EntityOfConcern, effective reference scheme, or an empirical-grounding participant; mitigation: apply C.2.1 constitution and then the direct neighboring relation pattern.
* **Analogy inflation.** Presenting CL‑0/1 as identity; mitigation: always name the **CL rung** for cross‑mappings.

### C.2:7 - Conformance Checklist

1. **C2-1 (Episteme constitution and neighbors).** Every `U.Episteme` **MUST** satisfy C.2.1 constitution through exact claim content, one exact EntityOfConcern, and one effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. Empirical grounding and edition are stated through their separate C.2.1 relations. Viewpoint selection and `U.View` conformance use E.17.0; representation uses C.29/A.6.3.RT; publication occurrence, form, and carrier use E.17/E.24.PUB. None is treated as an episteme slot or identity component merely because a record or notation places it beside the constitution values.
2. **C2‑2 (Coordinates).** Each episteme **SHALL** declare `[F,G,R]` with a brief rationale; **F** is `U.Formality ∈ {F0…F9}` per **C.2.3**, **exactly one episteme‑level F** computed as the **min over essential parts**. CL is declared for **pairs only**. A named notation scheme **MAY** use sub‑anchors (e.g., `F4[OCL]`, `F7[HOL]`), which **MUST** preserve the global order and **map to their parent anchor** from C.2.3.
3. **C2‑3 (Composition).** Authors **SHALL** choose Γ_mode (**series** vs **parallel**). For any justification **path** use **`R_eff(P) = max(0, min_i R_i − Φ(CL_min(P)))`**; for **parallel** independent lines to the *same claim*, take **`R(Γ) = max_P R_eff(P)`** (never exceeding the highest-R support line). Compute `F(Γ) = min` along the used paths. For **G**, use **path‑wise intersections** and then **SpanUnion({G_path}) constrained by support**. A traversal **MUST** name the actual scope-translation, notation, kind, plane, source-local, model-use, evidence-reuse, or other direct relation and apply only its declared congruence loss to `R`.
4. **C2‑4 (NotationBridge).** Multi‑notation representation components **SHOULD** register `NotationBridge` edges with CL and loss note; any cross‑notation reasoning **MUST** cite the bridge’s CL.
5. **C2‑5 (No action).** Epistemes **MUST NOT** be assigned actions; work is executed by systems in role.

### C.2:8 - Consequences

**Benefits.** A single, compact **map** for all knowledge epistemes or publications; fast detection of weakest‑link **R** in aggregates; disciplined reuse across domains with explicit **CL**; consistent separation of **meaning** from **material carriers**.
**Trade-offs.** Authors must learn to declare Γ-mode and CL explicitly; multi-notation work requires relation-specific bookkeeping. *Mitigation:* the three-part C.2.1 constitution test and direct neighboring patterns keep the ordinary entry brief while preserving recoverable precision.

### C.2:9 - Rationale

KD-CAL turns the coarse legacy semiotic picture into **holonic composition** over exact C.2.1 epistemes and their claims. Exact claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective reference scheme keep episteme identity stable; formal structure and claim scope (**F,G**), evidence (**R**), and pairwise congruence (**CL**) remain visible and composable without an omnibus slot relation. Direct grounding, edition, view, representation, publication, and carrier patterns prevent category collapse. The resulting characteristics remain **manager-readable** and **formalisation-ready**, with **G** grounded in scope/envelope rather than part count.

### C.2:10 - Relations

* **Depends on:** `C.2.1 U.Episteme: Constitution, Empirical Grounding, and Edition Relations` for episteme identity, the constitution relation, and the separate grounding and edition relations; `E.17.0` for viewpoint selection and `U.View` conformance; `C.29` and `A.6.3.RT` for representation; and `E.17`/`E.24.PUB` for publication occurrence, form, and carrier.
* **Peers:** planned **Sys-CAL** (`C.1`) may later consolidate physical-system guidance; current system composition, boundary, state, conservation, resource, and measurement claims use `A.1`, `A.14`, `A.22`, `A.3.4`, `B.1.6`, and `C.16` as applicable. KD-CAL composes **epistemes** and feeds assurance lenses in Part B.
* **Constrained by authoring:** Architectural patterns must include Tell–Show–Show with **Archetypal Grounding** (this section).

### C.2:11 - Worked mini‑examples (post‑2015 flavours)

* **Formal lift (ΔF).** Recasting a 2019 **variational free‑energy** narrative into a typed calculus raises **F**, clarifies scope, and enables CL‑2 bridges between biological and ML formulations—*without* claiming empirical gain (**R** unchanged).
* **Parallel evidence (R, max).** Two independent **hindcast** lines (circa CMIP6, 2019) supporting the same forecast allow `R(Γ)=max(R₁,R₂)`; if one line drifts, the composite is bounded by the higher-R support line until series constraints apply.
* **Notation bridge (CL drop).** A 2021 **type‑theoretic specification** rendered in a semi‑formal DSL requires a `NotationBridge` with a CL<3 note; any theorem transported across must respect the bridge’s declared preservation.

*(No tooling is implied; these are conceptual moves within the calculus.)*
