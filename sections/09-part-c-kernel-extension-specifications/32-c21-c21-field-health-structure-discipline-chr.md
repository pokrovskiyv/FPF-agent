## C.21 - Field Health & Structure (Discipline-CHR)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Type:** Pattern

> *Purpose.* Give FPF a **typed, reviewable** way to characterize the *health, maturity, and structure* of a scientific or engineering **discipline**, without collapsing into taste, anecdotes, dashboard views, audit labels, or single-number scores. The pattern defines a **portable set of Characteristics** and guards (scale admissibility, freshness, scope) that any Context can specialize.

*This pattern supplies the CHR vocabulary of health for disciplines. C.20 composes the discipline; C.21 declares discipline-health characteristics and admissible readings; Part G may publish SoTA palettes or time-series views; Bridges keep cross-context meaning honest; penalties touch **R** only.*

### C.21:0 - Use This When

Use this pattern when a team must characterize the health, maturity, or structure of a discipline without reducing the field to a dashboard score, popularity signal, or one preferred tradition. Typical cases include judging reproducibility, standards convergence, cross-tradition alignment, disruption balance, evidence granularity, or method-family diversity.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Field-health claims become attractive labels: ordinals get averaged, stale evidence looks current, local scope disappears, and cross-context reuse hides meaning loss behind one score.

**What this buys.** Discipline health becomes a vector of typed characteristics with scale, unit, polarity, freshness, scope, and bridge conditions visible before any comparison or publication view.

**Placement.** Part C (Kernel Extension Specifications) -> Cluster C.I (Core CHRs/CALs).
  **Depends on:** **MM-CHR** (C.16), **KD-CAL** (C.2), **USM/Scope** (A.2.6), **Trust & Assurance** (B.3), **E.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE)**.
  **Coordinates with:** **C.20 Discipline‑CAL** (what a `U.Discipline` is), **G.2** (SoTA palette), **G.12** (dashboard), **G.0** (CG‑Spec registry).

### C.21:1 - Problem Frame

FPF treats *disciplines* as first-class holons (see **C.20**): they aggregate epistemes, practices, standards, institutions, and observed Work. Teams routinely say “the field is fragmented,” “standards are converging,” or “replication is improving,” but these claims are rarely **typed** (scale/unit/polarity) or **replayable** (evidence lanes, freshness, scope). C.21 supplies the CHR vocabulary: named Characteristics with CSLC typing, so discipline-health claims can be compared admissibly (CG-Spec) and monitored through time (G.12) when a project needs that use. Each published value declares ReferencePlane ∈ {world|concept|episteme} and DisciplineId (U.Discipline@UTS); cross-plane use applies CL^plane in Assurance (penalty to R_eff only).

### C.21:2 - Problem

Narrative health claims cause three recurrent failure modes:

1. **Scale inadmissibility.** Averaging ordinals, mixing units, or comparing incommensurate Contexts => nonsense roll-ups.
2. **Staleness.** Health “scores” rarely declare **freshness windows** or evidence lanes (TA/VA/LA).
3. **Scope slippage.** “The field” is left implicit; cross-Context reuse lacks **Bridges & CL**, leading to silent semantic loss. Any numeric comparison or aggregation cites a **CG-Spec** row (characteristics, **ScaleComplianceProfile (SCP)**, **Γ-fold**, MinimalEvidence) before computation.

### C.21:3 - Forces

| Force                            | Tension                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comparability vs nuance**      | Need global pictures without erasing local meaning (Context, traditions, cohorts).                                         |
| **Ordinal vs interval/ratio**    | Powerful stats tempt inadmissible operations on ranks and categories.                                                                  |
| **Local evidence vs federation** | Health must be computed *in room* (Context slice) yet projectable across rooms via Bridges & CL (penalties to **R** only). |
| **Recency vs stability**         | Health evolves; time-series or dashboard views need **freshness**, not just cumulative history.                           |

### C.21:4 - Solution — **Discipline Health Characterisation (DHC)**

#### C.21:4.0 - Ontology quick sheet (normative, clarifying)
**What “DHC” is.** DHC is a **CHR vocabulary pack** that defines **Characteristics** + **Scales/Units/Polarity** for discipline health; it is not a document or a run.
**Artifacts.**
• **`U.DHCPack`** (I-lane name; published as an episteme): the **slot set** (Characteristic/Scale declarations) for a Context.
• **`U.DHCMethodSpec`** (S-lane): the **computational specification(s)** for deriving each DHC slot (e.g., replication‑window definition, CD‑index class), table‑backed; multiple per slot allowed, editioned separately.
• **`U.DHCSeries`** (episteme w/ `EditionSeries`): a **time‑indexed publication** of computed DHC readings for a Discipline×Context, each value bound to `…Ref.edition` for every referenced method/metric/distance.
**Edition subjects.**
(i) **DHCPack.edition** — when the **slot semantics** (Characteristic/Scale) change.
(ii) **DHCMethodSpecRef.edition** — when a **computation method** (formula/class/policy) changes.
(iii) **DHCSeries.edition** — when the **published series** changes its content (not carriers).
**Publication.** Releases are **Work** on Carriers; **no** edition change unless content changes per `U.EditionSeries`.
**Ref discipline.** All bindings to packs/methods/distances use `...Ref.edition` (dot on the Ref).

Define a **portable minimal set** of CHR **slots**. Each slot is **CHR-typed** (Characteristic, Scale/Unit/Polarity per **A.17–A.18**), **Context-local**, and guarded by **USM** (Claim scope **G**), **freshness windows**, and **evidence lanes** (TA/VA/LA).  Contexts may extend the set; conforming extensions do not alter scale types inadmissibly.

**“Health” is a vector** of CHR‑typed coordinates; **no single scalar** is implied. Scale-admissible scalarization lives in **Acceptance** (G.4) under an explicit **CG‑Spec ScaleComplianceProfile (SCP)** and **Γ‑fold** rules, and is never embedded in CHR.

#### C.21:4.1 - Core Characteristics (kernel-portable names)

1. **ReproducibilityRate** *(ratio ∈ [0,1]; polarity ↑; ReferencePlane=episteme; CG‑Spec‑bound)*
   Fraction of tested claims/benchmarks that independent teams **replicate** under a declared **ContextSlice** and **Γ\_time** window. **Lane tags:** LA (validation) with TA (typing) for protocols.

2. **StandardisationLevel** *(ordinal; polarity ↑; ReferencePlane=episteme)*
   {none, *emerging*, *de facto*, *de jure*}. **No mean.** Use medoid/mode; admissible comparisons are ≤/=/> only. Tracks convergence on vocabularies, interfaces, or procedures.

3. **AlignmentDensity** *(ratio; polarity ↑; ReferencePlane=episteme; CG‑Spec‑bound)*
   Density of **Substitution Bridges** (same **senseFamily**, CL≥2) between major `U.Tradition`s **per 100 DHC‑SenseCells** (G.2 F‑hooks) in the SoTA palette.  Substitution rule:  free substitution permitted at **CL=3**; at **CL=2** substitute only with extra‑guard (count in reporting, but this is not «free substitution») Units: `bridges_per_100_cells`. Cross‑Context use requires Bridge+CL; penalties → **R_eff** only.

 4. **DisruptionBalance** *(interval; polarity = target band; ReferencePlane=episteme; CG‑Spec‑bound)*
  Relative share of **disruptive vs consolidating** works within **Γ_time** using a **registered CD‑index class** (editioned; cite **method id** in UTS). **Default plane:** *episteme*. Publish the **target band** via **Acceptance (G.4)**; not in CHR.

  5. **EvidenceGranularity** *(Context-declared: ordinal|ratio; polarity ↑; ReferencePlane=episteme)*
   If ratio: units = `claims_per_artifact` or `anchors_per_claim` (declare). If ordinal: publish level names and **ORD_COMPARE_ONLY**.
   Fineness of evidential units and declared envelopes (experiment cards, benchmark tasks, audit granules). Encourages *smaller, well-scoped* claims over monoliths.

  6. **MetaDiversity** *(portfolio dispersion; polarity ↑ to band; ReferencePlane=episteme; CG‑Spec‑bound)*
  Use entropy/HHI **over MethodFamily/Tradition shares** (method edition id in UTS); publish **guard‑band** as **Acceptance** binding; cross‑ordinal scalarisation is forbidden.
  Entropy/Herfindahl-type dispersion across `U.Tradition`s, method families, or data regimes, bounded by a **Context-declared guard-band** (too low ⇒ monoculture; too high ⇒ incoherence).

> **Typing & admissibility.** Each slot declares **Scale/Unit/Polarity**; inadmissible operations (for example, means on ordinals or unit mixing) fail fast per **A.18/MM-CHR**.

#### C.21:4.1a - Engineering-grade and semio-substitution extension slots

Contexts MAY add these DHC slots when the discipline-health question includes engineering-grade reasoning, architecturing, optimization, prediction, comparison, assurance input, decision input, first-principles justification, mathematical-lens use, or source-publication overread. These slots remain discipline-health characteristics. They do not become evidence relations, assurance relations, gate decisions, mathematical-lens use, measurement admissibility, release permission, or project authority.

7. **EngineeringClaimJustificationRecoverability** *(ordinal; polarity ↑; ReferencePlane=episteme|world by declared claim; CG-Spec-bound when aggregated)*
   Degree to which engineering-grade claims in the discipline or Context expose the exact justification that carries their force for the declared use. The justification may be a named construction, source, model, lens, evidence relation, characteristic relation, assurance relation, gate relation, method relation, or heuristic triage boundary, but it must cite the neighboring pattern governing the claiming FPF pattern when that force is live (`A.10`, `B.3`, `A.15`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `C.16`, `C.29`, or another governing pattern). Heuristic examples may carry recognition and triage only; prediction, comparison, optimization, falsification, assurance-input, decision-input, or architecture-readiness force requires the recoverable justification.

8. **SemioSubstitutionPressure** *(ordinal or ratio; polarity ↓ to band; ReferencePlane=episteme; CG-Spec-bound when aggregated)*
   Degree to which discipline texts, patterns, dashboards, views, publications, source chains, or review artifacts substitute wording, publication form, record appearance, source appearance, or explanation fluency for the operative engineering entity, relation, work, evidence, assurance, gate, decision, method, or mathematical-lens claim. Lower pressure is healthier when the discipline keeps EntityOfConcern, episteme, publication, source, carrier, and project-side claim kind or admissible-use boundary separable and names the pattern governing the recovered claim for any claim being made or admissible-use boundary.

**Extension guard.** Activating either extension slot requires a local `EngineeringClaimJustification` note or semio-substitution note that names the claim kind being made or admissible-use boundary, neighboring pattern governing the claiming FPF pattern, admissible use, non-admissible overread, and stop or reopen condition. The note is a DHC value explanation, not a new evidence source, assurance case, gate, release record, or work authority.

#### C.21:4.2 - Guard Macros (normative)

* **ORD\_COMPARE\_ONLY(x)** — for **StandardisationLevel** (ordinal).
* **UNIT\_CHECK(x)** — forbid cross-unit aggregation (AlignmentDensity, ReproducibilityRate).
* **POLARITY_CHECK(x)** — enforce declared polarity (↑/↓/target-band) per MM‑CHR.
* **FRESHNESS(x; window)** — ensure values come from evidence within declared **Γ_time**; record **valid_until**; stale ⇒ {degrade|abstain} at Acceptance.
* **PLANE_NOTE(x)** — record **ReferencePlane**; compute **CL^plane** on crossings; penalties → **R_eff** only.
* **LANE\_TAGS(x; {TA|VA|LA})** — annotate contribution lanes.
* **SCOPE\_COVERS(x; TargetSlice)** — enforce **USM** coverage of the computation.
* **BRIDGE_CL(x; id, CL≥k)** — on cross‑Context roll‑ups, require **Bridge** with **CL**; penalties affect **R** only. If planes differ, apply **CL^plane** and cite **Φ_plane** policy id. **Hint:** for **AlignmentDensity** reporting, set **k=2** (CL≥2); **CL=3** counts as *free substitution*.

#### C.21:4.3 - Legality Matrix (extract)

| Operation     | ReproducibilityRate (ratio) | StandardisationLevel (ordinal) | AlignmentDensity (ratio) | DisruptionBalance (interval) |
| ------------- | --------------------------: | -----------------------------: | -----------------------: | ---------------------------: |
| mean          |                      **OK** |                     **FORBID** |                   **OK** |                       **OK** |
| median        |                          OK |                         **OK** |                       OK |                           OK |
| compare (<,>) |                          OK |                         **OK** |                       OK |                           OK |
| unit mix      |                  **FORBID** |                            n/a |               **FORBID** |                          n/a |

*Note:* For **MetaDiversity/EvidenceGranularity (ordinal)** use **median/mode**; forbid affine ops; unit mix always fails.

### C.21:5 - DHC Inputs, Outputs, and Cross-Context Reuse

* **Inputs.** `U.Discipline` from **C.20** (composition), SoTA **Palette**/**BridgeMatrix** from **G.2** (**DHC‑SenseCells** included), EvidenceProfiles from **G.4/G.6**.
* **Outputs.** Per‑Context **DHC rows** (these six slots), **UTS** Name Cards with twin labels (E.5/F.17–F.18), **Registry/RSCR hooks** on method edition changes; feeds **G.12** (time‑series).
* **Cross-Context reuse.** Only via **F.9 Bridges** with **CL** and **loss notes**; **Φ(CL)** penalties applied to **R** (never F/G).

### C.21:6 - Archetypal Grounding (three fields)

#### C.21:6.1 - Computer Vision (Benchmarks 2015→)
* **ReproducibilityRate.** Ratio of independently reproduced results on ImageNet-style tasks within **rolling 24 mo** (LA lane).
* **StandardisationLevel.** *de facto* for dataset specs and metrics in *Vision\_2024*; *emerging* for robustness protocols.
* **DisruptionBalance.** Use an editioned CD‑index class (e.g., Wu‑style disruption family) with method id; publish target band via Acceptance; annotate ReferencePlane=episteme.
* **AlignmentDensity.** Bridges with **CL≥2** across sub-traditions (supervised vs self-supervised).
* **MetaDiversity.** Entropy across method families (CNN/ViT/Hybrid) kept within guard-band to avoid monoculture.

#### C.21:6.2 - Biomedicine (Gene–Disease Associations)
* **ReproducibilityRate.** Fraction of associations replicated in independent cohorts within **Γ\_time(36 mo)**; LA lane with TA (typing of protocols).
* **StandardisationLevel.** *de jure* for certain reporting guidelines; *emerging* for pre-registration norms.
* **EvidenceGranularity.** Move from “paper-level” to *claim-level* units (Context raises the score).
* **DisruptionBalance.** Target band discourages sustained “novelty spikes” unbacked by replication.

#### C.21:6.3 - Software Performance Engineering (SPE)
* **StandardisationLevel.** *emerging* → *de facto* for SLO taxonomies and trace schemas across vendors.
* **AlignmentDensity.** CL-rated Bridges between tracing ecosystems.
* **ReproducibilityRate.** Share of publicly replicable perf claims in rolling windows.
* **MetaDiversity.** Balance across load models, failure modes, and toolchains.

#### C.21:6.4 - Decision‑Making (2015→)
• ReproducibilityRate — share of causal effect estimates replicated across independent datasets within Γ_time; LA lane.
• StandardisationLevel — *emerging* for identification checklists; *de facto* for SCM notation in leading stacks (ordinal; no means).
• AlignmentDensity — CL‑rated Bridges between SCM/DoWhy‑style and RL/BO traditions per 100 DHC‑SenseCells.
• MetaDiversity — dispersion across method families (SCM/RL/BO/DT) within guard‑band; entropy/HHI (units declared in CG‑Spec).

#### C.21:6.5 - Evolutionary Architecture (software)
• ReproducibilityRate — fraction of architecture fitness results reproduced on independent workloads (rolling 18–24 mo; LA lane).
• StandardisationLevel — *de facto* for ADR/ATAM patterns; *emerging* for continuous fitness protocols.
• AlignmentDensity — Bridges across ATAM/SAAM/ADR style guides (CL≥2) normalised per 100 DHC‑SenseCells.
• MetaDiversity — portfolio dispersion across patterns (microservices, event‑driven, layered) with guard‑bands; no ordinal arithmetic.

### C.21:7 - Characteristic Reading and Publication Use

1. **Declare Context & TargetSlice.** (USM) Name editions, Standards, env params, `Γ_time`.
2. **Collect evidence.** Bind sources via **G.6 EvidenceGraph**; tag lanes and freshness.
3. **Compute DHC slots.** Enforce **Legality Matrix** and Guard Macros.
4. **Bridge (if needed).** Map via **F.9**; attach **CL** and **loss notes**; apply **R** penalties.
5. **Publish to UTS.** Name Cards (Tech/Plain), twin labels; **bind `DHCMethodSpecRef.edition`**, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, and, where templates are used, `DHCMethodRef.edition`; register RSCR triggers (method change, ScoringMethod/NormalizationMethod edits).
6. **Publication view.** Feed G.12 with time-series and guard-bands (disruption, diversity) when a dashboard or trend publication is live.

### C.21:8 - Bias-Annotation (E-cluster lenses)

* **Didactic.** Plain names + twin labels; one-screen tables for managers.
* **Architectural.** No ordinals averaged; all cross-Context movement goes through Bridges+CL; penalties never touch F/G.
* **Pragmatic.** Freshness-aware; unknowns tri-state; values are decision-input cues, not trophies.
* **Epistemic.** Evidence lanes explicit; reproducibility is LA, typing is TA; validation distinct from dashboard or report publication.

### C.21:9 - Conformance Checklist

This checklist verifies a DHC reading after the practitioner has selected the live discipline-health question. It is not an audit form and not a dashboard specification.

| Check | Passing reading | Boundary preserved |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC-C.21-1 CHR typing.** | Every DHC slot declares Characteristic, Scale/Unit, and Polarity, with CSLC admissibility visible before aggregation. | Prevents health labels from becoming untyped opinion. |
| **CC-C.21-2 Freshness.** | Published values carry a `Γ_time` selector and freshness window; stale rows produce `{degrade|abstain}` in G.4 Acceptance. | Prevents stale cumulative history from masquerading as current health. |
| **CC-C.21-3 Plane.** | `ReferencePlane` is declared; cross-plane reuse publishes `CL^plane` policy id alongside CL, with penalties applied to `R_eff`. | Keeps world, concept, and episteme readings distinct. |
| **CC-C.21-4 Design/run tag.** | Each DHC row declares `DesignRunTag ∈ {design, run}` and does not mix design- and run-characteristics in one value or aggregate. | Prevents design claims and run observations from collapsing. |
| **CC-C.21-5 Lane tags.** | Each value tags TA/VA/LA lanes of contributing evidence. | Keeps typing, validation, and live-assurance lanes visible. |
| **CC-C.21-6 Ordinal discipline.** | `StandardisationLevel` remains ordinal: comparisons only, no means or z-scores. | Blocks pseudo-quantification. |
| **CC-C.21-7 Scope.** | All computations declare `TargetSlice`; USM membership is decidable for the declared use. | Prevents free-floating field-health claims. |
| **CC-C.21-8 Bridges.** | Cross-context comparisons or publications cite Bridge id and CL; penalties apply to `R_eff`, never to F/G. | Keeps local meaning loss visible. |
| **CC-C.21-9 UTS.** | DHC rows are publishable as UTS Name Cards with Tech/Plain twin labels. | Keeps names recoverable across contexts. |
| **CC-C.21-10 Registry.** | DHC methods are table-backed; method changes bump `DHCMethodSpecRef.edition` and trigger RSCR. | Prevents silent method drift. |
| **CC-C.21-11 Unknowns.** | Unknown inputs propagate tri-state `{pass|degrade|abstain}` to Acceptance; `unknown -> 0` coercion is excluded. | Preserves honest uncertainty. |
| **CC-C.21-12 Lexical firewall.** | Core narrative follows E.5.1 and does not use tool/vendor tokens as discipline-health kinds. | Prevents vendor or tool labels from becoming characteristics. |
| **CC-C.21-13 CG-Spec citation.** | Numeric comparison or aggregation in DHC cites CG-Spec: characteristics, `ScaleComplianceProfile`, `Γ-fold`, and MinimalEvidence. | Keeps operations scale-admissible. |
| **CC-C.21-14 Phi policies.** | `Phi(CL)` and `Phi_plane` are monotone, table-backed, and published by policy id. | Prevents hidden penalty functions. |
| **CC-C.21-15 Ref discipline.** | Edition pinning appears as `...Ref.edition` on the relevant reference field; bare `...Edition` fields are repaired. | Keeps edition subject explicit. |
| **CC-C.21-16 Role kit, informative.** | Standard roles from F.4 may be used: `DisciplineStewardRole`, `DHCMethodAuthorRole`, `DHCSeriesPublisherRole`; values still declare design/run stance and `ReferencePlane`. | Roles do not become evidence or authority. |
| **CC-C.21-17 Engineering-grade and semio-substitution extensions.** | When `EngineeringClaimJustificationRecoverability` or `SemioSubstitutionPressure` is active, the DHC row names the neighboring pattern governing the claiming FPF pattern that carries live engineering claim kind or admissible-use boundary or semio-substitution repair, plus admissible use, non-admissible overread, and stop or reopen condition. | The extension note is not evidence, assurance, gate passage, mathematical-lens use, release permission, work authority, or project certification. |

### C.21:10 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* Treating discipline health as one scalar score before the typed characteristic vector is declared.
* Averaging ordinal characteristics or mixing units because a dashboard wants one roll-up.
* Reusing a discipline-health value outside its Context, TargetSlice, freshness window, or Bridge+CL condition.
* Treating a standard, source publication, or dashboard view as proof that the discipline is healthy.
* Using engineering-grade or semio-substitution extension slots as evidence, assurance, gate passage, or project authority.

### C.21:11 - Consequences

**Benefits.** Scale-admissible comparisons; freshness-aware governance; explicit cross-tradition alignment; dashboard views that do not lie by averaging ranks.
**Costs.** Some ceremony (scales, windows, lanes, bridges), offset by template macros and UTS automation.
**Risks avoided.** “Phlogiston disciplines” (charisma-driven fields) surface as unhealthy in DHC readings; **No-Free-Lunch** preserved by G.5 (selector returns sets, not universal scalars).

### C.21:12 - Rationale

C.21 reads discipline health through typed characteristics rather than one global health score. This keeps reproducibility, freshness, disruption, standardization, bridge density, engineering-claim recoverability, and semio-substitution pressure inspectable without turning any dashboard or source tradition into authority by itself.

### C.21:12.1 - SoTA-Echoing

| SoTA/practice anchor | What it changes in C.21 | Adoption stance | Boundary of non-overread |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open Science Collaboration (2015), Munafò et al. (2017), and current reproducibility/metascience practice on replication, transparency, claim granularity, and freshness. | `ReproducibilityRate`, `EvidenceGranularity`, freshness windows, and evidence-lane tagging are live discipline-health characteristics rather than one global credibility score. | Adopt and adapt: use reproducibility as one typed characteristic with scope, window, and evidence lanes. | C.21 does not certify any single claim as true; claim evidence remains under `A.10`, `G.6`, or the evidence pattern governing the claim. |
| Fortunato et al. (2018) science-of-science framing and Wu, Wang, and Evans (2019) disruption-index family. | `DisruptionBalance` is a banded characteristic, not a monotone novelty target; the method id and edition are declared before use. | Adapt: use disruption/consolidation as a typed reading over a declared corpus and method edition. | Disruption is not quality, truth, safety, or project usefulness by itself. |
| Standards and ecosystem-convergence practice in engineering disciplines. | `StandardisationLevel` stays ordinal with comparison-only operations, and cross-context reuse goes through Bridge+CL rather than hidden averaging. | Adopt lightly: use standardization as an ordinal characteristic and preserve local meanings. | Standard status is not SoTA proof, evidence sufficiency, gate passage, or assurance. |
| Current plural-tradition and bridge-mapping practice in mature fields. | `AlignmentDensity` counts CL-rated Bridges per declared `DHC-SenseCells`; it rewards recoverable substitutions without semantic collapse. | Adopt: use explicit bridge/loss notes and keep penalties in R/R_eff only. | A high bridge count is not a universal language, consensus, or authority claim. |
| Engineering architecture and semio-bias control practice from the current FPF architecture workstream. | Adds `EngineeringClaimJustificationRecoverability` and `SemioSubstitutionPressure` as discipline-health extension slots. | Adopt for FPF-facing engineering disciplines: evaluate whether engineering claim kind or admissible-use boundary and semio-substitution pressure remain recoverable through neighboring patterns governing those claims. | These slots do not replace mathematical-lens use, evidence, assurance, gate, release, work, or project certification patterns. |

The practical consequence is that C.21 reads discipline health through typed characteristics. It can feed dashboards or time-series publications, but the dashboard is only a publication view over DHC readings; it is not the discipline-health ontology and not project authority.

### C.21:13 - Relations

* **Builds on:** **A.17–A.18** (Characteristic/CSLC), **A.2.6** (USM scopes), **B.3** (assurance lanes), **C.16** (MM-CHR templates).
* **Coordinates with:** **C.20** (what a `U.Discipline` *is*), **G.2** (SoTA palette and BridgeMatrix), **G.12** (Dashboard operationalization), **G.9** (parity harness for fair comparisons).
* **Constrains:** **G.10** (pack ships DHC rows + method ids), **G.11** (refresh windows/decay), **G.5** (selector may reference DHC only via admissible predicates; no cross‑ordinal scalarisation). **Coordinates:** **F.9** (Bridges for cross‑Tradition comparisons).
