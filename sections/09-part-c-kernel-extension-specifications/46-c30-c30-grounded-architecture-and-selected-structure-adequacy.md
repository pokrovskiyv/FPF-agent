## C.30 - Grounded Architecture and Selected-Structure Adequacy

> **Type:** Architectural pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### C.30:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when the current question is an `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim: which selected `U.Structure` refs matter for one described `U.Holon` in one `U.BoundedContext`, and what next architecture move follows.

The first useful move is small:

```text
ArchitectureQuestionCard@Project:
  describedHolonRef:
  boundedContextRef:
  architectureConcernCue:
  sourcePhrase?, if useful:
  questionDisposition:
    concernCueOnly | problemCardReady | architectureClaimReady | nonArchitectureClaimReady
  selectedStructureRefs or selectedStructureKindRefs:
  inspectedMaterialRole, if current:
  firstArchitectureMove:
  architectureDescriptionBridge, if durable description use is current:
  governingPatternApplicationRefs, if another claim is being made:
  non-admissible overread:
```

`architectureConcernCue` is recognition wording only until it helps choose one selected structure kind and one architecture move. When a controlled cue is useful, use `changeLocalization`, `substitutionOrReplacement`, `flowBottleneck`, `controlOrRateMismatch`, `dataCustodyOrStateResidence`, `physicalSeparationOrPlacement`, `evidenceReuseOrAssuranceReuse`, `scaleWindowOrCoarseningLoss`, `runtimeFailureMode`, `crossScopeResidual`, `descriptionViewLoss`, or `otherDeclared`. Local phrases such as change localization failure, hidden crossing, source return, generated-view loss, or state-residence uncertainty may remain in `sourcePhrase?` or Plain prose. If the described holon, bounded context, selected structure, and first move cannot yet be named, set `questionDisposition` to `concernCueOnly` or `problemCardReady` rather than promoting it to `ArchitectureOf@Context` by wording alone.

`ArchitectureQuestionCard@Project` is a project-side triage aid for choosing one architecture move. `questionDisposition` records the card's current result: keep it as a concern cue, prepare a `ProblemCard@Context`, open an `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim, or name the non-architecture governing pattern. The card is not an evidence record, gate, decision, release record, quality score, risk rating, or publication-authority claim. When those claims are being made, name the governing FPF pattern and keep C.30 to the architecture-claim portion; later sections cite this boundary rather than repeating the full non-use catalogue.

Use a conditional `ArchitectureDescription@Context` bridge only when durable architecture-description use is current: cross-team reuse, regulated or safety use, reusable design, comparison, source or lens reuse, or another named full-mode architecture-description use. Ordinary use stops at `ArchitectureQuestionCard@Project` when it makes one next architecture move clear. If the architecture description itself becomes the `EntityOfConcern` under repair, use `C.30.AD`.

What goes wrong if C.30 is missed: the practitioner reasons from a document, module diagram, workflow graph, mathematical lens, benchmark, maturity score, or decision record instead of recovering the described holon, selected structures, first architecture move, and neighboring claim kind.

What C.30 buys in practice: a practitioner can separate architecture claim, selected structure, architecture description, view, publication form, source relation, and non-architecture claim kind, then choose one small next architecture move.

Not this pattern when the `EntityOfConcern` under repair is not an architecture claim, selected architecture-relevant structure, source relation, description relation, view relation, publication-role recovery for an architecture claim, or the thin architecture-description bridge needed for one architecture move. Use the direct governing pattern named by the recovered relation, and keep C.30 only for the architecture-claim portion if that portion is being claimed. Common neighboring claim boundaries are summarized in `C.30:12`.

Thin precision-restoration pointer: if the issue under repair is still whether *architecture*, *architecture description*, *structural view*, *module diagram*, *model*, *source material*, *functional architecture*, or a source label such as *layer*, *level*, *tier*, *stack*, *block*, *expert*, *cache*, *router*, or *gate* names an architecture claim, description, view, publication form, source relation, structure, or non-architecture governing-pattern application, use `C.30.P` or `C.30.STRAT` as triggered before applying C.30 to the recovered architecture portion. If the recovered issue is mathematical-lens use, apply `C.29`; when no mathematical-lens move changes the architecture work, keep ordinary prose or use `NoMathLensUseNeededNote` under C.29 rather than creating a C.30-local lens result. Keep the trigger tables in those patterns; C.30 is applied only after `ArchitectureOf@Context`, selected architecture-relevant structure, conditional `ArchitectureDescription@Context` bridge use, `C.30.AD` application, or the non-architecture application named by value is recoverable.

### C.30:2 - Problem

Engineering teams use "architecture" for several different things:

- the selected structure of a holon;
- a diagram, model, table, dashboard, generated relation graph, or document;
- a module layout;
- a selected transformation-flow structure, flow description, or mathematical graph description;
- a functional, control, information, deployment, logical, or physical structure view;
- an ADR-like publication;
- a project-side claim carried by another governing FPF pattern.

These uses are all useful in ordinary engineering speech, but they cannot carry the same FPF claim. The core distinction is the one already used across FPF: the architecture-relevant selected structure, the architecture claim over that structure, the Description episteme or view of that claim, the publication of that description or view, and the project decision about changing architecture are different records.

The first-minute practitioner can ask: Are we choosing an architecture, or just naming a module layout? Which structure is being described: function, flow, control, module structure, interface relation, work, role relation, enactor structure, evidence relation, assurance relation, information structure, data structure, placement structure, deployment structure, scale structure, or declared logical structure? What is the inspected material being used as: architecture claim, description, view, publication form, decision, source relation, or mathematical lens?

How can FPF describe architecture without:

- creating `U.Architecture` as a new root kind;
- treating a description, view, diagram, graph, ADR, dashboard, or generated relation graph as the architecture;
- reducing architecture to module structure or interface relation;
- letting E.18 transformation-flow structures, LCA structures, control structures, C.29 lenses, quality language, evidence, assurance, gates, work, or decisions silently become architecture ontology;
- making architecture descriptions so heavy that ordinary practitioners cannot get a first useful move.

### C.30:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Everyday architecture speech vs FPF kind precision | Engineers need familiar phrases such as functional architecture, physical architecture, and control architecture; FPF-governed use recovers described holon, bounded context, selected structure, structure kind, source, description, view, or publication role, and admissible use. |
| Architecture claim vs architecture description | A useful architecture description can be mistaken for the architecture claim or for the selected structure. |
| Multi-view adequacy vs module reduction | Architecture includes functional, flow, control, module structure, interface relation, work, role relation, evidence relation, information structure, placement structure, scale, and declared logical structures; module diagrams are only one structure kind. |
| Small first move vs full record | The practitioner often needs one architecture question card, not a complete architecture description record set. |
| SoTA architecture-description discipline vs tool lock-in | ISO 42010-style view, viewpoint, and correspondence discipline is useful, and FPF adapts it to holons, epistemes, views, publications, source return, and governing-pattern applications. |
| Structure source relation vs overread | A structure, graph, lens, measurement, or model can supply a source relation for an architecture description without proving evidence, assurance, causality, gate passage, or release. |

### C.30:4 - Solution

C.30 starts from one architecture move over one described `U.Holon` in one `U.BoundedContext`: recover the `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim record when it is being claimed, selected `U.Structure` references, structure kind refs, the source, description, view, or publication role of the inspected material, and first admissible architecture move. Use a conditional architecture-description bridge when durable, reusable, multi-view, regulated, comparison, or reliance-bearing description is being made. If `ArchitectureQuestionCard@Project` gives one usable next move, stop there.

In C.30, the EntityOfConcern for this use is the architecture claim, one of its selected structures, or the relation record or claim record named by value for the architecture use being made. The description is not the architecture itself, and description hygiene is not the center of C.30.

Architecture-description material in C.30 is deliberately minimal. C.30 itself is not the full architecture-description mechanism. It binds `ArchitectureDescription@Context` to `ArchitectureOf@Context`, selected structures, structural views, correspondence, source return, and admissible use only when durable description use is being made. `C.30.AD` carries the full architecture-description EntityOfConcern: multi-view description sets, viewpoint-based views, correspondences, source return, freshness, specification use, and publication boundary over `ArchitectureOf@Context`. Generic Description, view, viewpoint, publication-face, and publication-form machinery still remains in A.7, E.17.0, E.17.1, E.17.2, and E.17. C.30.ASV carries the selected-structure-kind-to-view relation; C.30.TFS-REL, C.30.LCA, and other named subpatterns carry named structure relations.

C.30 does not mint `U.Architecture` and does not redefine `U.Viewpoint`. It specializes A.22 structure records and `U.MultiViewDescribing` only for architecture descriptions whose DescriptionContext `EntityOfConcernRef` is the `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim record for a holon, while preserving the EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme and specification-use distinction between architecture and its descriptions. Use A.1 for `U.Holon`, A.22 for selected `U.Structure`, and E.24.PUB when the problem is a confusion among ontic, ontic-description episteme, and publication form.

C.30 governs grounded architecture adequacy for one `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim record over selected `U.Structure` references for one described holon in one bounded context. It governs `ArchitectureOf@Context`, `ArchitectureQuestionCard@Project`, selected architecture-relevant structures, architecture structure-kind recovery, source, description, view, or publication-role recovery, first architecture-question assignment, characteristic assignment, small boundary notes, and the thin `ArchitectureDescription@Context` bridge when durable description use is being made. It does not mint `U.Architecture` and does not govern all architecture structure-kind views; `C.30.ASV` governs architecture structural views, and `C.30.AD` governs the full architecture-description mechanism. Generic guards about publication, permission, promise, evidence sufficiency, gate passage, work authority, decision authority, or release authority stay in the publication-use boundary or in governing patterns.

#### C.30:4.1 - Architecture claim record

```text
ArchitectureOf@Context ::= {
  describedHolonRef: U.HolonRef,
  boundedContextRef: U.BoundedContextRef,
  structureRefs: FinSet(U.StructureRef),
  structureKindRefs: FinSet(ArchitectureStructureKindRef),
  architectureConcernCue?,
  governingArchitectureConcernRefs?,
  architectureConcernNotes?,
  structuralRelationRecordRefs?,
  admissibleUse,
  nonAdmissibleUse
}
```

`ArchitectureOf@Context` is a project-side architecture claim record over selected structures. It is not the selected structure itself, not a Description episteme, not a view, not a diagram, not a publication face, not a decision, and not a new root `U.*` kind.

`ArchitectureOf@ContextRef` is admissible as a `DescriptionContext.EntityOfConcernRef` for architecture Description epistemes and views. The holon whose architecture is claimed remains `ArchitectureOf@Context.describedHolonRef`; it is not the DescriptionContext `EntityOfConcernRef` for those architecture descriptions unless a separate direct holon description is opened.

**EntityOfConcern bridge.** In C.30, the primary `EntityOfConcern` is the `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim record, one of its selected structures, or a related relation record or claim record selected by the use under repair. Selected architecture structure is dependent, non-agentive, and claim-bearing through episteme or view records, but it is not a second EntityOfConcern family beside `EntityOfConcern`. Publication faces, forms, units, and renderings publish descriptions or views; they do not become the architecture claim or the selected structure.

#### C.30:4.2 - Conditional architecture-description bridge

C.30 does not define a second local `ArchitectureDescription@Context` record shape. The canonical `ArchitectureDescription@Context` record is governed by `C.30.AD:4.1`. C.30 admits only a thin bridge to that record when durable architecture-description use changes the first architecture move.

The minimum bridge recoverable in C.30 is:

```text
C30ArchitectureDescriptionBridge minimum:
  architectureClaimRef: ArchitectureOf@ContextRef
  selectedStructureRefs or structureKindRefs:
  architectureStructuralViewRefs? only when a structural view is being used
  admissibleUse:
  nonAdmissibleUse:
  correspondenceRefs or sourceReturnCondition? when reuse, cross-view use, or source return is needed
  freshnessCueRefs? when currentness bounds the admissible use
```

This bridge does not mint another `ArchitectureDescription@Context` definition, does not add local fields to the canonical record, and does not collect non-architecture claim kinds as architecture-description ontology. It lets the C.30 reader say why a description matters for the next architecture move, then applies `C.30.AD` whenever the architecture description itself becomes the `EntityOfConcern` under repair or the full mechanism is needed: multi-view composition, correspondence, source return, freshness, specification-use boundary, publication-use boundary, or reusable architecture-description use.

An architecture-description freshness cue is also canonical in `C.30.AD:4.4`. C.30 may point to that cue only to bound the admissible use of the first architecture move; the cue is not evidence sufficiency and not assurance.

#### C.30:4.3 - Publication-use boundary

This subsection is the C.30 publication-use boundary. It says what an architecture description or its publication does not carry by itself, while the subject Solution stays about architecture claim, described holon, selected structures, structural views, and the next architecture move. If a guard concerns permission, promise, prescription, evidence sufficiency, assurance, decision, gate passage, work authority, release, or authority-source claim, keep it here, in `C.30.AD`, or in the description or publication pattern governing that claim rather than expanding C.30's thin bridge.

```text
ArchitectureDescriptionPublication@Project ::= {
  sourceEpistemeRef | sourceViewRef,
  publicationViewpointRef?,
  publicationScopeId,
  boundedContextRef,
  mvpkFaceRef,
  publicationFormRef,
  sourcePinSetRef,
  audience,
  admissiblePublicationUse,
  nonAdmissiblePublicationUse
}
```

`ArchitectureDescriptionPublication@Project` is subordinate to E.17 and MVPK machinery. It publishes one source episteme or episteme-lane view reference. `publicationViewpointRef?` names the publication-side viewpoint only when MVPK needs one; it is not an architecture viewpoint and not a TEVB viewpoint. `mvpkFaceRef` is a publication-lane face reference, not an alternative source episteme, source view, or source relation. Publication does not add neighboring claim authority; apply `C.30:4.3` and the governing pattern when evidence, gate, work, assurance, decision, or release claims are current.

Model cards, system cards, and evaluation harness reports enter C.30 through the same publication boundary or source-relation boundary. They may describe a model, deployed AI system, architecture claim, evaluation harness, or policy, but the architecture move still needs `ArchitectureOf@Context`, selected structures, and any neighboring proof, release, or gate claim assigned to its governing pattern.

```text
ModelCardOrSystemCardBoundaryNote@Project ::= {
  sourcePublicationRef,
  entityOfConcernRef,
  entityOfConcernKind:
    model | deployedAISystem | architectureClaim |
    evaluationHarness | policy | otherDeclared,
  architectureStructureKindRefs?,
  intendedUseScope,
  evaluationScopeAndKnownLoss?,
  deploymentContextMismatch?,
  evidenceOrAssuranceGoverningPatternRef?,
  nonAdmissibleUse:
    notArchitectureAdequacy | notSafetyProof |
    notReleaseAuthorityByPublicationAlone
}
```

If the card or harness is used beyond transparency, recover the architecture structure kind being used first and then apply `A.10`, `G.6`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `C.16`, `C.28`, or `C.11` for the non-architecture claim kind.

#### C.30:4.4 - Architecture name formation

The word `architecture` is shorthand only after the described holon, bounded context, selected structures, structure kind, and source, description, view, or publication role are recoverable. Without those qualifiers, it is a recovery trigger, not a stable FPF term.

```text
ArchitectureNameFormationRule:

If a text says "<X> architecture", then the FPF-governed use is conforming only with:
  describedHolonRef,
  boundedContextRef,
  structureKindRef = <X>StructureKind or declared local relation,
  structureRefs,
  ArchitectureStructuralViewRefs if this is a description or view claim,
  admissibleUse,
  nonAdmissibleUse.

If <X> is not a declared structure kind, the phrase is plain recognition wording only.
```

| Phrase | Required recovery |
| --- | --- |
| functional architecture | `structureKindRef = FunctionalStructure`; functions, effects, capabilities, and functional dependencies named as structure content; transformation-flow structures, paths, and flow valuations are assigned to `TransformationFlowStructure` or `C.30.TFS-REL`. |
| modular architecture | `structureKindRef = ModuleInterfaceStructure`; module relation records, interface specifications, substitutability rule, and change policy. Full module-and-interface repair applies the module-and-interface repair pattern when that claim kind is being made. |
| logical architecture | `structureKindRef = DeclaredLogicalStructure`; local definition says whether `logical` means information relation, functional relation, runtime relation, responsibility relation, allocation relation, or another relation class. |
| physical architecture | `structureKindRef` in `{MaterialSpatialStructure, PlacementDeploymentStructure}` or a locally declared physical structure kind. |
| control architecture | `structureKindRef = ControlStructure`; an LCA record may describe the control structure, but proof claims are assigned to dynamics, temporal, causal, evidence, safety, or assurance patterns as triggered. |
| information architecture | `structureKindRef = InformationDataStructure`; state bearer and residence, schema refs, semantic refs, persistence locus, provenance relation, custody relation, and source-return conditions. |
| security architecture | `structureKindRef = SecurityTrustBoundaryStructure`; recover protected asset or effect, trust boundary, adversarial path, authority or privilege relation, secure-default or hardening boundary, and evidence, assurance, or gate governing patterns when those claim kinds are being made. |

#### C.30:4.5 - Architecture characteristic assignment

C.30 uses three bearers before any `quality`, `fitness`, `measure`, `metric`, `score`, `modularity`, or `ility` wording carries an architecture-adequacy claim. Those words are triggers for bearer recovery, not stable architecture adequacy by themselves.

```text
ArchitectureCharacteristicAssignment:

A. SystemQualityAffectedByArchitecture
   Bearer: described U.Holon, named product holon, or named system holon
   Governing pattern: C.25 Q-Bundle or C.16
   Examples: maintainability, evolvability, resilience, availability, safety, observability

B. ArchitectureStructuralCharacteristic
   Bearer: `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim, architecture structural view, declared structural relation or constraint, module relation, or interface relation
      Governing pattern: selected from C.16, A.17-A.19, C.25, or the characteristic-space or Q-bundle pattern governing the characteristic claim
   Examples: coupling, cohesion, interface alphabet, substitutability, hidden coupling, reusable-structure share

C. ArchitectureAdequacyBearer
   Bearer: one selected architecture adequacy bearer: `ArchitectureOf@Context`, selected architecture-relevant structure, `ArchitectureDescription@Context` when durable description use is being made, architecture structural view, or correspondence model
   Governing pattern: selected from C.30 for grounded architecture and selected-structure adequacy, E.17 for publication-face and view discipline, C.16.Q for quality-term precision, or C.16 for measurement and characterization
   Examples: viewpoint coverage, correspondence adequacy, source-return adequacy, description modularity
```

C.30 keeps only a thin bridge from structural characteristics to Q-Bundle relevance. If the claim says architecture causes an outcome improvement, assign the causal-use claim to `C.28` before causal use. If a structural characteristic is used as a mechanism, constraint, predictor, proxy, evidence relation, or causal hypothesis for a Q-Bundle slot, start with `ArchitectureStructuralCharacteristicQBundleRelationLine` rather than a formula such as `low coupling = maintainability`; assign measurement, modularity scoring, reusable-structure accounting, bespoke-residue accounting, evidence, assurance, gate, causal, and scale-audit claims to their governing patterns.

`ArchitectureStructuralCharacteristicQBundleRelationLine` is the only ordinary first-contact relation shape C.30 introduces for this case. Do not add a second generic characteristic relation record in C.30. Use the line when the useful move is to show why one structural characteristic may matter without opening the full relation record. Do not use this line as a measurement record, modularity score, evidence sufficiency statement, assurance verdict, or causal proof:

```text
ArchitectureStructuralCharacteristicQBundleRelationLine ::= {
  architectureClaimRef: ArchitectureOf@ContextRef,
  architectureStructuralViewRef?: ArchitectureStructuralView@ContextRef,
  structuralCharacteristicCueOrRef,
  affectedQBundleSlotRef,
  qBundleRelationKind:
    structuralCharacteristicRelevantToQBundleSlot |
    structuralCharacteristicConstrainsQBundleSlot |
    structuralCharacteristicPredictsQBundleSlot |
    structuralCharacteristicProxiesQBundleSlot |
    structuralCharacteristicCausalHypothesisForQBundleSlot |
    structuralCharacteristicEvidenceRelationForQBundleSlot(A.10-governed evidence relation only when evidence provenance is the claim being made),
  relationGroundingKind:
    modelBased | empirical | causalModelBased | expertJudgement |
    sourceLineageOnly | SoTAActionLineage | reportOnly,
  evidenceOrCausalGoverningPatternRef?,
  nonAdmissibleUse
}
```

Minimal structural-characteristic relation-line examples:

| Structure kind | Structural characteristic cue or relation | Affected Q-Bundle slot | Relation grounding note | Non-admissible use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ModuleInterfaceStructure` | Stable interface specification plus substitution policy. | Evolvability or replaceability. | Replacement without global retesting. | Open label as substitutability proof. |
| `PlacementDeploymentStructure` | Controller placed near plant or edge-node locality. | Latency, resilience, or jurisdictional compliance. | Reduced communication delay and bounded data custody. | Placement diagram as performance or legal proof. |
| `InformationDataStructure` | State bearer, residence, provenance, and custody boundary. | Observability, privacy, or auditability. | Recoverable state lineage and bounded custody. | Data schema as evidence sufficiency. |
| `MaterialSpatialStructure` | Physical separation, adjacency, or energy path. | Safety, maintainability, or energy efficiency. | Isolation, accessibility, or loss reduction. | Geometry as safety proof. |
| `ControlStructure` | Observer-controller-plant loop with rate envelope. | Stability, controllability, or safety. | Feedback and bounded actuation relation. | Control diagram as proof. |
| `TransformationFlowStructure` | Path crossing, bottleneck, buffer boundary, or waiting-line boundary. | Latency, throughput, or resilience. | Recoverable path, crossing, capacity, and valuation relation. | Flow diagram or mathematical graph description as performance or causal proof. |
| `SecurityTrustBoundaryStructure` | Trust boundary, privilege path, or untrusted-input crossing. | Security, abuse resistance, or privacy. | Reduced exposed authority and bounded trust crossing. | Risk color or compliance label as security proof. |
| `EvidenceAssuranceStructure` | Evidence package reused across variants. | Assurance maintainability or release readiness. | Explicit affected-structure and source-return boundary. | Evidence-structure view as assurance verdict. |
| `WorkMethodStructure` | Method description, work plan, or work enactment relation with explicit exception path. | Operability, auditability, or maintainability. | Bounded repeatability and recoverable exception handling. | Work-method diagram as work authority or evidence sufficiency. |

`ArchitectureCharacteristicQBundleRelationRecord` is a triggered full-mode record, not the ordinary first-contact shape. Use the full record only when publication, comparison, causal use, evidence reliance, assurance, gate, decision, or reusable cross-case relation reliance is being claimed and the thin line cannot keep the relation inspectable, reusable, or bounded. This preserves the protection against causal or quality overread without turning C.30 into a measurement-first pattern.

Relation kinds in this record are C.30-local relation tokens. They must remain recoverable as A.6.P-style relation specifications: polarity, participant slots, qualifiers, witness expectations, admissible semantic change classes, and bridge or loss boundary where those boundary conditions are being claimed.
ISO/IEC 25010-like quality models may be used as quality vocabulary or comparison lineage for product qualities such as reliability, security, maintainability, usability, efficiency, compatibility, or portability. C.30 does not inherit them as architecture theory. Architecture relates to qualities through Q-Bundle slots, mechanism slots, relation class or admissible-use value, evidence or causal governing patterns, or report-only use.

```text
ArchitectureCharacteristicQBundleRelationRecord ::= {
  architectureClaimRef: ArchitectureOf@Context,
  architectureStructuralViewRef?,
  architectureDescriptionRef?,
  structuralCHRRefs,
  affectedQBundleRefs,

}
```

#### C.30:4.6 - Relation to structural views

`C.30.ASV` governs `ArchitectureStructuralView@Context`. C.30 governs the `ArchitectureOf@Context` claim and, only when durable description use is being made, how its thin `ArchitectureDescription@Context` bridge uses structural views, with hidden or lost structure, correspondence, source or reliance relation, and source-return boundaries recoverable when those boundaries affect action. `C.30.AD` governs the full architecture-description mechanism.

A diagram, model, table, selected transformation-flow diagram, mathematical graph description, LCA diagram, C.29 lens output, ADR, dashboard, generated explanation, or other publication face may carry an architecture description or an architecture structural view. It does not become the architecture, and it does not become a conforming view only because it looks like a view.

Use `AffectedArchitectureStructureNote` when the next architecture move needs to name affected structures or view losses without using an architecture decision, ADR, gate, evidence, assurance, or release record:

```text
AffectedArchitectureStructureNote:
  architectureClaimRef:
  affectedStructureKindRefs:
  affectedStructureRefs?:
  affectedArchitectureStructuralViewRefs?:
  acceptedOrSuspectedViewLoss?:
  sourceReturnCondition?:
  nextAdmissibleMove:
```

This note only names affected architecture structure for the next move. Decision, ADR, gate-passage, evidence-sufficiency, and release-authority claims apply the patterns governing those claims.

#### C.30:4.7 - Minimal boundary notes

Use these notes when a common architecture phrase is close to a governing pattern but the full governing-pattern application is not yet needed for an asserted claim.

Use the thinnest relation form that preserves the next architecture move. Use fuller relation governing the asserted use records only when the relation being used cannot be inspected, used, compared, refreshed, or bounded without it. Typical thin forms are `ArchitectureMathLensUseBoundary` before C.29 Mini or Full, `AffectedArchitectureStructureNote` before an architecture decision record, and `ArchitectureStructuralCharacteristicQBundleRelationLine` before full measurement records, causal records, or evidence records.

```text
InterfaceSignatureBoundaryNote ::= {
  phraseOrArtifactRef,
  apparentClaim:
    interface | signature | port | endpoint | connector | link |
    API | protocol | E.18 transformation-flow relation | E.18 path | mechanism reference,
  recoveredKind,
  governingPatternApplicationRefs,
  admissibleUse,
  nonAdmissibleUse
}

ModuleRelationBoundaryNote ::= {
  phraseOrArtifactRef,
  apparentClaim:
    module | component | package | platform | open architecture |
    recoveredModuleInterfaceSourceLabel |
    typed control-structure relation,
  moduleInterfaceRepairClaimCurrent?: yes | no,
  openOrPlatformClaimCurrent?: yes | no,
  selectedModuleInterfaceRelationRefs?,
  variationPointRef?,
  substitutabilityPolicyRef?,
  interfaceConformanceEvidencePatternRef?,
  changePathRef?,
  consumerMigrationBoundary?,
  versionOrUpdateChannelRef?,
  secureDefaultOrHardeningBoundary?,
  governingPatternApplicationRefs,
  admissibleUse,
  nonAdmissibleUse
}
```

These notes are not substitutes for the module named by value-and-interface repair pattern, interface specifications, signature records, conformance evidence, or module-and-interface repair. An open or platform label is not substitutability proof, security proof, scale proof, assurance, or universal maturity evidence. A source label such as `layer`, `stack`, `block`, `expert`, `cache`, `router`, or `gate` enters this note only after `C.30.STRAT` recovers a module-interface or adjacent architecture-relevant item. It becomes architecture-relevant only through local structure, interface, variation, substitution, migration, update, and hardening boundaries. Relation-heavy wording inside these notes remains a Plain cue until an module relation reference named by value, interface relation ref, relation governing the asserted use record, or governing FPF pattern application is named. The note keeps first use honest until the non-architecture claim kind named by value is being made.

#### C.30:4.8 - Architecture mathematical-lens boundary

Architecture descriptions may use C.29 lenses, but the lens does not become architecture ontology.

```text
ArchitectureMathLensUseBoundary:
  noMLUNeeded?: yes | no
  lensOneLine?:
    lensRef,
    structureClaimRef,
    preservedStructure,
    lostStructure,
    lensRelationKind,
    stopCondition,
    governingPatternApplicationRefs?
```

Use the one-line boundary only when it is enough to keep the lens from being overread. Use a C.29 Mini or Full card when the lens choice, preserved structure, lost structure, relation class or admissible-use value, or stop condition changes the architecture move.

Lens use by architecture problem:

| Architecture problem | Candidate mathematical lens | Preserved structure | Typical loss or stop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hidden dependency or modularity. | Typed graph, DSM, or hypergraph. | Dependency, coupling, or clustering. | Semantics, interface law, evidence, and work remain outside unless bridged. |
| Flow bottleneck. | Transformation-flow structure, network flow, or queueing. | Path, crossing, valuation, and capacity. | Purpose, proof, causality, and safety remain non-architecture claims. |
| Control-rate mismatch. | LCA, hybrid systems, assumption-guarantee relations, or control relations. | Feedback roles and scale or rate relations. | Stability proof and safety proof remain outside the lens. |
| Cross-scope residual. | Coarse-graining or renormalization-group-style lens. | Preserved and lost structure across scale. | Utility, causal-use claims, and selector authority remain outside unless separately grounded. |
| Extracted structure from traces. | Epiplexity or MDL-style bounded-observer lens. | Learnable structural regularity. | Task relevance, assurance, and causal proof remain non-architecture claims. |
| Physical separation or spatial arrangement. | Topology, geometry, or spatial graph lens. | Adjacency, containment, separation, reachability, energy path, or material path. | Safety proof, accessibility, legal acceptance, and causal-use claims remain outside unless separately grounded. |
| Composition relation. | Category, open-systems, or compositional lens. | Interface, composition, and coherence. | Domain semantics remain outside unless bridged. |

This table is not a C.29 replacement and does not make mathematics mandatory. It helps the practitioner see when a lens may add a useful architecture move; C.29 still carries lens-use result, preserved structure, lost structure, relation class or admissible-use value, and stop condition when those description or view uses are being made.

Epiplexity-like use remains a C.29 bounded-observer structural-information lens. It may help recover learnable structure from traces, but it is not an architecture quality, task relevance proof, causal proof, assurance, or selector authority.

#### C.30:4.9 - Boundary and repair table

| Tempting collapse | C.30 repair |
| --- | --- |
| Bare architecture as free-floating selected claim | Recover `ArchitectureOf@Context`, `describedHolonRef`, `boundedContextRef`, selected `structureRefs`, selected `structureKindRef`, source, description, view, or publication role for inspected material, `admissibleUse`, and `nonAdmissibleUse`. |
| Architecture description as architecture | Keep `ArchitectureDescription@Context` as Description episteme or specification-use case over `ArchitectureOf@Context`. |
| Diagram, model, table, dashboard, or generated relation graph as architecture | Treat it as publication form, description, view, source relation, or source-finding aid only when that relation is explicit. |
| Module diagram as all architecture | Use `C.30.ASV` to recover structure kind; module structure and interface relation are only one structure family. |
| Transformation-flow structure or graph description as architecture | Use E.18 for selected transformation-flow structure, path, and crossing records; use E.18.2 and C.29 for mathematical graph descriptions; use C.30.TFS-REL for the architecture-to-transformation-flow relation. |
| LCA diagram or control diagram as proof | Use `C.30.LCA` for control-structure view; assign dynamics, temporal, causal, evidence, gate, safety, and assurance claims to their governing patterns. |
| Mathematical lens as architecture ontology | Use `C.29`; cite `MathLensUseOutputRef` only through an `ArchitectureMathLensUseBoundary` or C.29 lens record and state stop condition. |
| ADR as architecture decision | Use the project-side architecture decision pattern when a decision claim is being made; ADR is a publication form, not the decision. |
| Quality, score, or measurement term as architecture adequacy | Recover the bearer through ArchitectureCharacteristicAssignment; assign the claim being made to C.25, C.16, A.17-A.19, the characteristic-space or Q-bundle pattern governing the characteristic claim, or C.30 grounded architecture, selected-structure, or conditional description-use scope. |
| Architecture record as evidence, assurance, gate, work, or release | Assign evidence, assurance, gate, work, or release claims to A.10, G.6, B.3, A.20, A.21, A.15, or the release locus named by value when a release claim is being made. |
| Architecture as agent, worker, controller, gate, or proof | Recover the mechanism, control relation, role and enactor relation, gate, work, evidence, or assurance record that carries enforce, decide, optimize, adapt, prove, or guarantee wording; keep `ArchitectureOf@Context` as a selected-structure claim, not an acting entity. |

#### C.30:4.10 - Worked slices

**"We have the architecture in this diagram."** The diagram is a publication face unless it explicitly publishes an `ArchitectureDescription@Context` or `ArchitectureStructuralView@Context`.

```text
ArchitectureQuestionCard@Project:
  describedHolonRef: payment system
  boundedContextRef: checkout platform context
  architectureConcernCue: descriptionViewLoss or flowBottleneck
  sourcePhrase?: "architecture in this diagram"; unclear dependency between payment orchestration and fraud scoring
  questionDisposition: architectureClaimReady
  inspectedMaterialRole: diagram as publication face carrying possible architecture structural-view material
  selectedStructureKindRefs: FunctionalStructure, ModuleInterfaceStructure, TransformationFlowStructure
  firstArchitectureMove: recover the diagram as a publication face and create a minimal architecture structural-view note
  governingPatternApplicationRefs: C.30.ASV
  non-admissible overread: treating the diagram as architecture itself, evidence, assurance, gate passage, or decision
```

**"Low coupling gives maintainability."** C.30 does not allow that formula to carry the claim by itself. The ordinary repair starts with the thin relation line:

```text
ArchitectureStructuralCharacteristicQBundleRelationLine:
  architectureClaimRef: ArchitectureOf@ContextRef
  structuralCharacteristicCueOrRef: coupling under module relation or interface relation
  affectedQBundleSlotRef: maintainability Q-Bundle slot
  qBundleRelationKind: structuralCharacteristicRelevantToQBundleSlot
  relationGroundingKind: sourceLineageOnly | SoTAActionLineage | modelBased, as actually grounded
  evidenceOrCausalGoverningPatternRef?: one selected governing pattern reference: C.28, B.3, A.10, or G.6 when evidence sufficiency, causal-use, assurance, or safety-case claim is being made
  nonAdmissibleUse: causal proof or assurance by slogan
```

Use `ArchitectureCharacteristicQBundleRelationRecord` only when publication, comparison, causal use, evidence reliance, assurance, gate, decision, or reusable cross-case relation reliance needs the fuller record. The useful move is to decide whether a structural characteristic has a bounded relation to a maintainability slot, not to accept the slogan as architecture truth.

**"The backup-pump architecture is safe because the loop is redundant."** C.30 starts with the plant holon, bounded operating context, and selected structures: control loop, material-flow structure, placement structure, module-interface relation, and maintenance-work relation. The redundancy phrase may motivate an architecture move, but safety proof, causal proof, evidence sufficiency, gate passage, and work authorization move to their governing patterns. The C.30 output is the selected structure and next architecture move, not a safety case by slogan.

**"We replaced the neural-network block, so the architecture improved."** Treat `block` first as a source label and apply `C.30.STRAT` unless the changed value is already recovered. The phrase is admissible architecture recognition only after the changed structure kind, transformation-flow relation, module or interface claim kind, preserved and lost structure, changed characteristic, source relation, and decision or evidence governing patterns are named. A block label, benchmark result, ablation, pruning mask, or distillation result is not an architecture decision, evidence sufficiency, gate passage, assurance, or architecture adequacy by itself.

### C.30:5 - Archetypal Grounding

| Tell-Show-Show row | Grounding |
| --- | --- |
| Tell | A project team says "architecture" while looking at a diagram, model, generated relation graph, ADR, or module list. C.30 asks what holon is being described, what structure is selected, what source, description, view, or publication role the source material has, and what architecture move remains admissible. |
| Show: `U.System` | A payment system, plant, vehicle, product platform, AI-agent system, or neural-network model has selected structures: function, flow, control, module structure, interface relation, information structure, placement structure, scale structure, work structure, evidence relation, or declared logical structure. The architecture claim is over selected structures of that holon; the publication is not the holon and not the architecture claim. |
| Show: `U.Episteme` | An architecture description, model, view, generated relation graph, ADR-like note, safety-case view, or dashboard is an episteme or view publication. It can describe an architecture claim or serve as a source relation for it, but it does not become the architecture, evidence sufficiency, gate result, assurance case, or project decision. |

### C.30:6 - Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Arch**, **Onto**, **Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**, **Gov**. Scope: FPF architecture-description use over holons.

| Bias risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Module-diagram bias | Keep module structure and interface relation as one structure family among several; use `C.30.ASV` and the module-and-interface repair pattern when a module or interface claim is being made. |
| Tool-model bias | Treat notation, tool model, generated relation graph, diagram, and dashboard as description, specification-use, or publication forms unless a declared governing relation gives the source material a more specific role. |
| Check-only bias | The first output is an architecture question card plus action palette, not a checklist that only detects mistakes. |
| Assurance or gate bias | Architecture descriptions do not certify safety, evidence sufficiency, release, or gate passage; assign those claims to the governing patterns. |
| Didactic-thinning risk | Semantic repair preserves why the distinction matters: the pattern begins with the practitioner situation, payoff, stop condition, and first move. |

This checklist verifies the preceding guidance after the practitioner has chosen the selected move; it is not a required project control form and not a substitute for the card, note, view, relation, or repair move above.

### C.30:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Failed-check repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CC-C30-1 Grounded architecture name.** | An FPF-governed architecture claim names the described holon, bounded context, selected structures, structure kinds, source, description, view, or publication role, admissible use, and non-admissible use. | Rewrite the phrase through `ArchitectureQuestionCard@Project` or demote it to Plain recognition wording. |
| **CC-C30-2 No `U.Architecture`.** | The pattern use does not mint or rely on a root `U.Architecture`. | Use `ArchitectureOf@Context` over selected A.22 structures, or assign the claim to another existing kind. |
| **CC-C30-3 EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary plus specification-use separation.** | Architecture claim, structure, description, view, publication face, decision, evidence, and work stay distinct. | Downgrade the source material to its description, specification-use, or publication role and name the claim or non-architecture claim kind separately. |
| **CC-C30-4 ArchitectureOf record.** | Architecture descriptions and views point through `ArchitectureOf@Context`; the described holon is recovered through `architectureClaimRef.describedHolonRef`. | Add `ArchitectureOf@Context` or split direct holon description from architecture-claim description. |
| **CC-C30-5 DescriptionContext reuse.** | `ArchitectureDescription@Context` reuses `DescriptionContext` and existing DescriptionContext machinery; it does not redefine viewpoint or publication ontology. | Replace local fields with imported DescriptionContext fields, apply `C.30.AD` when the full architecture-description mechanism is being used, or assign the publication or view claim to E.17, A.6.3, or E.17.0. |
| **CC-C30-6 Small output before heavy record.** | Ordinary use may stop at `ArchitectureQuestionCard@Project` when one next architecture move and governing-pattern application is clear. | Remove needless full-record expansion or explain which full-mode trigger is present. |
| **CC-C30-7 Structure-kind boundary.** | Structural-view claims apply `C.30.ASV`; module, function, flow, control, work, evidence, scale, and decision claims do not collapse into C.30. | Name the structure kind, state the structural view if needed, or assign the claim to the governing pattern. |
| **CC-C30-8 Characteristic assignment.** | Quality, measure, score, metric, modularity, and `ility` wording recovers its bearer and governing pattern before use. | Add `ArchitectureCharacteristicAssignment`, or narrow the sentence to ordinary non-FPF-governed recognition. |
| **CC-C30-9 Non-architecture claim kind.** | Evidence, assurance, causal, gate, work, decision, publication-authority, mathematical-lens, measurement, and release claims are assigned to their governing patterns. | Name the governing FPF pattern and the claim kind being made; do not add fields to C.30 to absorb it. |
| **CC-C30-10 Useful action.** | The repaired wording leaves a surviving admissible action: name the architecture claim, recover a source, description, view, or publication role, state an architecture structural view, add a source or reliance relation, add a `SourceReturnCondition`, or apply the FPF pattern that governs the claim kind being made. | Restore that action, or classify the phrase as reduced-use cue, quote-only wording, blocked transfer, or incomplete rewrite. |

### C.30:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Architecture-as-document** | The document, diagram, table, generated relation graph, or dashboard is called the architecture. | Recover publication form, description, view relation, or source relation and name `ArchitectureOf@Context` only when selected structure is being claimed. |
| **Publication-unit architecture drift** | One publication unit mixes architecture description, evidence claim, gate decision state, decision note, and work authority under one architecture heading. | Name the source architecture description or view, keep the publication face subordinate to E.17 and MVPK, and assign evidence, gate, decision, and work claims to the patterns governing those claims. Architecture remains the selected-structure claim, not the publication heading. |
| **Module-diagram takeover** | Architecture is reduced to module structure or interface relation. | Recover structure kind and use `C.30.ASV`; assign full module repair to the module-and-interface repair pattern when that claim kind is being made. |
| **Tool-model lock-in** | A notation or tool model becomes the source of architecture truth. | Recover FPF architecture claim, structures, views, correspondence, and source-return condition. |
| **Evidence laundering** | A published architecture description is used as evidence sufficiency. | Assign the evidence relation or evidence claim to `A.10` or `G.6`; C.30 keeps only the architecture claim, selected-structure, and conditional architecture-description-use boundary; the evidence relation stays with the evidence pattern. |
| **Assurance or safety overread** | Architecture description or LCA diagram is used as assurance or safety case. | Assign the claim being made to `B.3`, `A.10`, `G.6`, `C.30.LCA`, or the safety-case or gate pattern governing the claim when that claim kind is being made. |
| **Risk color as architecture decision** | A red, yellow, or green risk cell, risk matrix, or maturity score decides the architecture move or resource-allocation priority. | Recover the structure kind under consideration, affected scope, loss, hazard, or threat path, source relation or grounding relation, characteristic scale, comparator, and gate pattern; architecture adequacy, evidence sufficiency, causal proof, assurance proof, resource-allocation reason, and gate-passage claims stay with their governing patterns. |
| **Causal slogan** | Architecture property is said to cause a quality without a declared relation grounding. | Start with ArchitectureStructuralCharacteristicQBundleRelationLine; apply C.28, evidence, causal-use, or assurance pattern, or use ArchitectureCharacteristicQBundleRelationRecord only when evidence sufficiency, causal-use, assurance, or full relation-record use is being claimed. |
| **Architecture-operation overread** | Replacing a block, module, layer, protocol, cache, memory path, or flow relation is treated as improvement by label alone. | Apply `C.30.STRAT` to source labels, then recover changed structure kind, preserved structure, lost structure, source relation, affected characteristic, and decision or evidence governing pattern. |
| **Sterile compliance rewrite** | The text becomes well typed but no longer helps the practitioner act. | Restore `ArchitectureQuestionCard@Project`, a concrete next architecture move, or a named governing-pattern application. |

### C.30:9 - Consequences

| Benefit | Cost or trade-off |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture claims become separable from diagrams, publications, generated relation graphs, ADRs, module lists, and decisions. | A conforming use names described holon, context, selected structure, and source, description, view, or publication role when the use has FPF-governed use. |
| The pattern enables first-principles architecture reasoning without forcing full measurement, synthesis, assurance, or decision machinery. | Some familiar architecture phrases become triggers for quick recovery rather than accepted claims. |
| Functional, flow, control, module structure, interface relation, information structure, placement structure, scale structure, work structure, evidence relation, and declared logical structures can coexist without one structure kind swallowing the rest. | Structural-view adequacy is governed by `C.30.ASV`, so practitioners can require an explicit view application. |
| C.29, E.18, LCA, module-and-interface repair, evidence, assurance, and gate patterns can supply source or reliance relations for architecture work without becoming architecture ontology. | Governing pattern applications are named by value whenever a source or reliance relation is used beyond C.30 architecture claim, selected-structure, or conditional description-use scope. |

### C.30:10 - Rationale

Architecture is most useful in FPF when it stays close to selected structure over a holon and far away from document-as-architecture, graph-as-architecture, model-as-architecture, and decision-as-architecture collapses. The `ArchitectureOf@Context` record gives the selected structure a project-side claim handle without minting `U.Architecture`.

C.30 and C.30.ASV establish an FPF architecture kernel: architecture as selected `EntityOfConcern` structure for a described holon, with Description epistemes and structural views, structure-kind discipline, correspondence and source-return boundaries, and characteristic-relation applications. They do not by themselves provide full measurement, synthesis, decision, causal proof, safety proof, or assurance.

The small first card is deliberate. Architecture discussions often need one immediate move: name the holon, choose the structure kind under consideration, recover a source, description, view, or publication role, assign an evidence or assurance claim to its governing pattern, or stop. A full architecture description is useful only when durable publication, cross-team use, comparison, regulated use, source reuse, or reliance-relation reuse is being made.

The DescriptionContext structure also preserves plurality. The same architecture claim may have several descriptions and views; several publications may render one description; several source records may be source relations for a view with different validation boundaries. C.30 keeps those variants usable without turning any one publication form into the architecture.

### C.30:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Practice or source line | C.30 adoption | Action consequence | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 view, viewpoint, concern, and correspondence discipline | Adopt view, viewpoint, and correspondence discipline for architecture descriptions. | Ask for architecture claim, `DescriptionContext`, viewpoint or correspondence relation, and next architecture move before notation-specific records. | Reject tool, notation, or method-description lock-in; FPF holon, episteme, view, and publication split stays governing. |
| OMG SysML v2 and current MBSE traceability and model-consistency practice | Adapt model-view consistency and traceability as source-return and relation pressure when architecture description or traceability wording has FPF-governed use. | Use correspondence, source pins, description-reliance relations, and source-return conditions. | Reject model-as-architecture overread and tool dependence. |
| SEI views-and-beyond lineage plus current multi-view practice | Keep module, component-and-connector, runtime interaction, allocation, and placement as separate view pressures. | Do not reduce architecture to module structure or interface relation; assign structural-view claims to `C.30.ASV`. | Older view taxonomies are lineage and comparison lineage, not a second FPF ontology. |
| arXiv:2603.00601 code-space architecture relation-graph work and related code-agent architecture probing benchmarks | Adapt partial-observability probing, typed edge rules, component-boundary rules, invariant-field semantics, uncertainty or unexplored-region reporting, and probe-as-intervention warning. | A generated code relation graph can supply a source relation for an architecture description or structural view only with claim, source, uncertainty, relation semantics, and source return. | Do not mint `U.CodeSpace`; do not treat probe or benchmark output as architecture adequacy, evidence sufficiency, assurance, or release. |
| Holon-architecture law-like constraint set from the architecture source | Adopt Conway mirroring, Amdahl, queueing, requisite-variety, information-hiding, effective-interface, abstraction-leakage, proxy-pressure, end-to-end, distributed-structure, and evolution-constraint sources only as architecture-relevant pressure and recognition cues. | Use them to ask which selected structure, characteristic, correspondence, flow boundary, control boundary, or architecture move is being considered; then apply `A.6.M`, `C.31`, `C.30.ASV`, `C.30.LCA`, `C.30.TFS-REL`, `C.29`, `C.16`, `C.25`, `G.5`, `C.11`, or the governing pattern. | No law-like slogan is architecture adequacy, decision, evidence sufficiency, assurance, gate passage, or universal architecture ontology by itself. |
| GonzoML neural-network architecture corpus as source example for general architecture-operation language | Adopt practitioner architecture-operation language as general architecture material: structural substitution, relation retargeting, dataflow change, path-selection and gating, memory and cache placement, block and layer substitutions, MoE expert-selection, pruning, distillation, NAS, ablation, and compute, memory, and latency tradeoffs. | Keep source labels as source labels through `C.30.STRAT`; after recovery, use the language for architecture-description and architecture-view recognition, transformation-flow-structure source relation, module-and-interface repair, scale characterization, candidate move guidance, and decision-context fields. | Neural-network labels, benchmarks, ablations, pruning masks, search outputs, or distillation success do not become FPF ontology, architecture decision, evidence sufficiency, gate passage, assurance, or architecture adequacy by themselves. |
| Platform-engineering, MOSA, and open-systems practice | Adapt open-interface, platform extension-rule, substitution-policy, and conformance-expectation pressure as local architecture boundary discipline. | For an open-interface claim or platform claim, name the local structure, interface, variation point, substitution policy, conformance-evidence governing pattern, migration boundary, update channel, and hardening boundary that change action. | Platform design depends on project, organization, time, and place; there is no universal platform maturity scale or open-label proof. |
| ADR and architecture-knowledge-management practice | Adopt decision-memory pressure only as a project-side decision concern governed outside C.30. | Treat ADR-like material as publication or decision-description source relation until the architecture decision claim is being made. | ADR is not the project decision itself and not a source of release authority. |

### C.30:End
