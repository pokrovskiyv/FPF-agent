## C.3.4 - RoleMask — Contextual Adaptation of Kinds (without cloning)

> **One-line summary.** Defines **`RoleMask`** as a C.2.1 declaration episteme for one named local use of an exact base kind. Its content pins the base `KindSignature` edition, additional candidate-feature constraints, vocabulary bindings, intended guard use, and definedness. Applying it yields an exact `true`/`false`/`unknown` masked judgment; it creates neither a new kind nor a direct membership relation. Cross-context use requires an obtaining KindBridge relation, a target declaration, and a separate MaskAdapter declaration when constraints or bindings change. Formality remains on declaration epistemes; guard refusal remains separate from `unknown`.

**Status.** Normative in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3.4**.
**Audience.** Engineering managers, architects, reviewers, editors.

**Depends on.**

* **C.3.1 — U.Kind & SubkindOf (Core):** kinds are intensional; `⊑` is a partial order; kinds **carry no Scope**.
* **C.3.2 — Kind intent, judgment, and extension:** `KindSignature` is a declaration episteme; the exact four-input judgment is three-valued; any extension is a pinned-edition representation of true candidates.
* **C.3.3 — KindBridge & CL^k:** Cross‑context kind mapping; `CL^k` penalties → **R** only.
* **A.2.6 — USM (Context slices & Scopes):** Claim/Work scope (**G**) over `U.ContextSlice`; bridges and **CL** for scope.
* **C.2.2 — F–G–R; C.2.3 — U.Formality (F).**

**Non‑goals.**
— No repository/notation mandates; conceptual only.
— RoleMask is **not** a governance tier, data policy, or “mini‑type system.”
— RoleMask does **not** redefine Scope; context conditions belong to **USM**.

### C.3.4:1 - Purpose (manager’s view)

Teams often need a **local projection** of a widely used kind:

* **Constraint:** “For our procedure, take `Vehicle` **with ABS** only.”
* **Vocabulary:** “Here, `AuthHeader` is called `X‑Auth`.”

If each team clones a fresh kind, catalogs fragment and bridges multiply. `RoleMask` is the disciplined alternative: keep the base kind identity, apply declared constraints and bindings, and publish one named, versioned declaration episteme that a guard can designate. The episteme is not a new U-kind, record ontology, or classification occurrence. When the constraint becomes a stable conceptual distinction, identify a separate local kind and establish its `U.SubkindOf` relation independently.

**Benefits:** fewer near‑duplicates, cleaner Cross‑context reuse, deterministic guards, and auditable narrowing instead of hand‑wavy “this is the version we mean.”

### C.3.4:2 - Context

Kinds (C.3.1/3.2) name **what** claims quantify over; USM (A.2.6) governs **where** claims hold. In practice, procedures need **local tailoring** of kinds for a role/process (compliance profile, product line, cohort). RoleMask gives that tailoring **without** mutating entityOfConcern (Kind) or applicability (Scope).

### C.3.4:3 - Problem

1. **Kind sprawl.** Teams mint near‑duplicate kinds (“Account\_PCI”, “Account\_Ledger”), and alignment decays.
2. **Hidden constraints.** Informal “we only accept …” statements leak into prose; guards can’t check them deterministically.
3. **Scope conflation.** Contextual requirements (jurisdiction, API version) get smuggled into “type” talk, blurring Scope vs Kind.
4. **Cross‑context fragility.** Masks don’t travel unless their constraints are mapped; teams reuse names and hope.

### C.3.4:4 - Forces

| Force                                   | Tension to resolve                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Local specialization vs common core** | Need Context‑specific tailoring **without forking** kinds.                                                      |
| **Expressivity vs determinism**         | Masks must express real constraints **and** be **deterministically checkable** at guard time.                |
| **Context vs entity constraints**       | Conditions over **ContextSlice** (Scope) vs conditions over **entities** (membership) must be split cleanly. |
| **Reuse vs proliferation**              | Encourage reuse; when a distinction becomes stable, review and separately identify a local kind and its obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relation rather than treating mask reuse as promotion. |

### C.3.4:5 - Solution — RoleMask declaration and masked judgment

A `RoleMask` is a named, versioned C.2.1 declaration episteme. Its exact `EntityOfConcern` is the base local kind used by the named procedure or role, while its claim content designates:

1. the exact base kind and pinned base `KindSignature` edition;
2. the named receiving use and mask type: constraint, vocabulary, or composite;
3. additional direct candidate-feature predicates, when any;
4. vocabulary or notation bindings;
5. the exact `U.ContextSlice` conditions and dependencies under which evaluation is defined;
6. any context expectations routed separately to USM Scope; and
7. the intended guard use and the declaration episteme's own `U.Formality`, when current.

For classification, evaluate:

`J_mask(candidate, kind, kindSignatureEdition, roleMaskEdition, slice) ∈ {true, false, unknown}`

The masked judgment is the three-valued conjunction of the base C.3.2 judgment and every additional direct candidate-feature predicate: it is `false` when the base judgment or any added predicate is known `false`; it is `true` only when the base and every added predicate are known `true`; otherwise it is `unknown` because a required component cannot settle or the candidate is outside its evaluation domain. A vocabulary-only mask adds no predicate and therefore preserves the base judgment exactly. A guard may decline use on `unknown`; that refusal is not a `false` classification.

An optional `RoleMaskExtension(roleMaskEdition, kindSignatureEdition, slice)` may represent the candidates whose exact masked judgment is `true`, with both declaration editions pinned. It is not `U.EntitySet`, an A.14 membership occurrence, a new kind, or a direct classification relation. Context conditions such as jurisdiction, API version, and time remain USM Scope predicates and do not become candidate features.

A stable conceptual refinement may justify a separately identified local kind plus an obtaining C.3.1 `U.SubkindOf` relation. The RoleMask declaration itself never creates that kind or relation.

### C.3.4:6 - Norms & Invariants (normative)

> The following state RM-01 through RM-10 over the declaration episteme, masked judgment, Scope split, and cross-context adapter boundary.

#### C.3.4:6.1 - Definition and shape

**RM-01 (Definition).** A `RoleMask` SHALL be a named, versioned C.2.1 declaration episteme with exact base kind, pinned `KindSignature` edition, named receiving use, mask type, direct candidate-feature constraints, vocabulary bindings, definedness conditions, intended guard use, and any separately owned Scope expectations. Its formality characterizes this episteme, not the kind or one judgment result.

**RM-02 (Not a new kind).** A RoleMask MUST NOT introduce a new `U.Kind`. If the domain needs a stable conceptual refinement, identify another local kind and establish an obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relation under C.3.1; a catalog row or mask declaration does neither.

**RM-03 (Determinism and three values).** The exact masked judgment MUST be reproducible for fixed candidate, kind, kind-signature edition, RoleMask edition, and slice. It returns `true`, `false`, or `unknown`; implicit `latest` is forbidden and guard refusal does not rewrite `unknown`.

**RM-04 (Mask type).** A declaration SHALL state constraint, vocabulary, or composite. A vocabulary mask preserves the base judgment. Constraint and composite masks use only direct candidate-feature predicates and apply the three-valued conjunction rule: any known `false` conjunct gives `false`, all known `true` conjuncts give `true`, and every other combination gives `unknown`.

#### C.3.4:6.2 - Separation of channels

**RM-05 (Context versus candidate).** Direct governed features of the exact candidate may contribute to `J_mask`. Predicates about ContextSlice, including jurisdiction, standards, environment, and `Gamma_time`, SHALL be enforced through USM Scope. The declaration may cite both, but the guard routes them to different owners and never hides Scope inside classification.

**RM-06 (Guard use).** A guard MAY designate a RoleMask declaration only when its exact edition, base `KindSignature` edition, dependencies, and definedness are recoverable and the required candidate features can be evaluated. A mask name is not a kind synonym. The guard consumes the three-valued masked judgment and makes a separate use decision.

#### C.3.4:6.3 - Stable refinement and catalog representation

**RM-07 (Stable refinement).** When the additional criterion becomes a broadly reused conceptual distinction, review whether another local kind is warranted. If so, identify that kind under C.3/C.3.2 and establish an obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relation under C.3.1. Retire or retain the RoleMask only for its remaining local use; no mask, catalog action, or label performs kind admission.

**RM-08 (Addressability and catalog representation).** Every RoleMask declaration edition used by a guard SHALL have a durable designator or reference that resolves to the exact declaration edition, base `KindSignature` edition, dependencies, definedness, and intended use. A context MAY present those references, constraints, bindings, examples, and bridge/adapter dependencies in a catalog. The catalog row is a representation, not the declaration episteme or a new kind. Consolidation changes the catalog and may motivate a declaration revision; it does not merge kind identities by itself.

#### C.3.4:6.4 - Cross-context use

**RM-09 (Bridge and adapter boundary).** For cross-context masked classification, first establish the obtaining KindBridge relation between the independently identified source and target kinds. Use the target `KindSignature` edition and a target RoleMask declaration. When constraint predicates or vocabulary bindings change, a separate C.2.1 `MaskAdapter` declaration episteme states the deterministic correspondence and loss; it is neither a relation occurrence nor the target judgment. Evaluate the exact target `J_mask`; do not copy the source result. `CL^k` and any scope-bridge consequence affect R only.

**RM-10 (Definedness and fail-closed use).** The RoleMask and any MaskAdapter declarations SHALL each state their definedness. Outside RoleMask definedness, or when its own required evaluation dependency is unavailable, the target masked judgment is `unknown`. Outside MaskAdapter definedness, the adapter correspondence is unavailable and a guard declines the cross-context use without rewriting an independently evaluated target `J_mask`. In both cases fail-closed is a use disposition, not an assertion of `false`.

### C.3.4:7 - Invariants & Non‑goals (normative)

* **No Scope leakage.** RoleMasks **cannot** widen/narrow **Claim scope (G)**; any context conditions are enforced by USM guards.
* **Identity preservation.** The carrier kind remains `k`; RoleMask does not change entityOfConcern.
* **Weakest-link unaffected.** RoleMask declarations do not alter weakest-link rules on F/R; guards route candidate-feature predicates to the exact masked judgment and context predicates to USM Scope.

### C.3.4:8 - Interactions (informative)

#### C.3.4:8.1 - With Kinds & Subkinds (C.3.1)

Use a RoleMask declaration for procedural tailoring. If the criterion becomes conceptual and stable, identify another local kind and establish the exact obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relation; do not treat mask reuse, promotion language, or a catalog link as that relation.

#### C.3.4:8.2 - With judgment and declarations (C.3.2)

* The base `KindSignature` episteme supplies the kind criterion and its own F.
* The separate RoleMask declaration supplies additional candidate-feature constraints or vocabulary bindings and may have its own F.
* The exact masked judgment pins both editions and preserves `unknown`; neither formality value belongs to the kind, candidate, or truth value.
* Any `RoleMaskExtension` is only a pinned-edition representation of true masked judgments.

#### C.3.4:8.3 - With KindBridge (C.3.3)

Cross-context use needs an obtaining KindBridge relation, its separate bridge assertion, the target RoleMask declaration, and—when constraints or aliases change—a separate MaskAdapter declaration episteme. R receives the justified penalties while F, G, and the target judgment remain unchanged. If the target constraint is a stable conceptual refinement, consider a target-side local kind and an independently obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relation.

#### C.3.4:8.4 - With guards (Annex C.3.A)

`Guard_MaskedUse` designates the exact RoleMask and base KindSignature editions, evaluates `J_mask` for the exact candidate and slice, checks USM Scope separately, and preserves `unknown` when the classification cannot settle. For cross-context use, it composes with `Guard_XContext_Typed` only after the KindBridge relation, bridge assertion, target declarations, and any MaskAdapter declaration are recoverable. The guard applies justified `Phi(CL)` and `Psi(CL^k)` effects to R and then makes its separate use decision; it changes neither F, G, nor classification truth.

### C.3.4:9 - Anti‑patterns & Remedies (informative)

| Anti‑pattern                                      | Why it’s wrong                         | Remedy                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mask treated as a new type | Duplicates the kind and hides the declaration episteme | Keep the base kind; for a stable conceptual refinement identify another local kind and establish `U.SubkindOf` independently. |
| Hiding Scope in a masked judgment | Conflates context with candidate features | Move context predicates to USM guards; keep only direct candidate-feature predicates in `J_mask`. |
| Unregistered mask in guards                       | Non‑deterministic; un‑auditable        | Register & version the mask; fail closed otherwise.                                   |
| Cross-context use without exact bridge and adapter objects | Silently reuses source truth | Establish the KindBridge relation and bridge assertion, target declarations, and any MaskAdapter episteme; then evaluate the target `J_mask` and apply justified R penalties. |
| Mask proliferation (ten masks that mean the same) | Catalog entropy; inconsistent behavior | Consolidate declarations; for a stable conceptual distinction, separately identify a local kind and establish its obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relation. |
| Treating a mask name as a kind synonym | Hides constraints and invites misuse | Designate the exact RoleMask declaration edition and base kind separately in prose and guards. |

### C.3.4:10 - Worked Examples (informative)

#### C.3.4:10.1 - `Vehicle@ABSOnly` constraint use

The `RoleMask` declaration episteme designates `Vehicle`, pins its `KindSignature` edition, and adds the direct candidate-feature predicate `hasABS(candidate)=true`. For an exact vehicle and TargetSlice, evaluate `J_mask(vehicle, Vehicle, vehicleEdition, absMaskEdition, TargetSlice)`. Surface, speed, rig, and time remain Scope predicates. Missing ABS evidence gives `unknown`; a guard may decline use. If ABS becomes a stable conceptual distinction, identify local kind `VehicleWithABS` and establish an obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relation separately.

#### C.3.4:10.2 - `AuthenticatedRequest@Frontend` vocabulary use

The RoleMask declaration binds `authHeader` to local spelling `X-Auth` and adds no candidate criterion. The masked judgment therefore equals the base `J(request, AuthenticatedRequest, authEdition, slice)`. Another spelling, row, or field does not classify the request. Cross-context kind use still requires the exact KindBridge relation; local aliases alone require no MaskAdapter unless their correspondence is relied on across contexts.

#### C.3.4:10.3 - `AdultPatient@Clinic` composite use

The declaration pins the base adult-patient signature edition and adds the direct candidate-feature criterion `ageAt(patient, slice) >= 21`; `EHR system = X` remains Scope. A date-of-birth record may support the age claim, but record availability is not the patient feature or the mask criterion. In Jurisdiction Y, establish the KindBridge relation to the target kind, use a target RoleMask edition, and use a MaskAdapter declaration only for a changed age threshold or interpretation. Evaluate the exact target `J_mask`. An unavailable date-of-birth dependency yields `unknown`; the guard declines use separately and R receives only the justified bridge penalties.

### C.3.4:11 - Authoring & Review Guidance (informative)

#### C.3.4:11.1 - Authoring a RoleMask card

**Publication fields (suggested).** A card or catalog row may represent the RoleMask declaration's designator, base kind, pinned kind-signature edition, declaration edition, type, intended use, candidate-feature constraints, separately routed Scope expectations, bindings, definedness, examples, known bridge/adapter declarations, and any stable-distinction review note. The card is not the declaration episteme or a new ontic object.
**Rules of thumb.**

* Keep entity predicates **small and testable**.
* Put context predicates in Scope, not in the masked classification criterion.
* If several teams reuse the same stable conceptual constraint, review whether a separately identified local kind and an obtaining `U.SubkindOf` relation are warranted; mask reuse itself establishes neither.

#### C.3.4:11.2 - Reviewer 7‑point checklist

1. Mask **registered** and **versioned**?
2. **Type** declared correctly (constraint/vocabulary/composite)?
3. Entity vs context **split** respected?
4. **Determinism** (no “latest”) satisfied?
5. Does the guard route context to USM, evaluate the exact three-valued masked judgment for the candidate, and keep refusal separate?
6. Does every cross-context use recover the KindBridge relation and assertion, target declarations, any MaskAdapter episteme, target `J_mask`, and only the justified R penalties?
7. Is declaration consolidation sufficient, or does a stable conceptual distinction warrant a separately identified local kind and independently obtaining subkind relation?

### C.3.4:12 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **RM-01** | RoleMask is a C.2.1 declaration episteme with exact base kind, pinned `KindSignature` edition, declaration edition, intended use, constraint/binding content, definedness, and its own formality when current. |
| **RM-02** | It creates no new kind or `U.SubkindOf` relation; any stable refinement is independently identified and governed by C.3.1. |
| **RM-03** | `J_mask(candidate, kind, kindSignatureEdition, roleMaskEdition, slice)` is reproducible and returns `true`, `false`, or `unknown`; guard refusal is separate. |
| **RM-04** | Vocabulary masks preserve the base judgment; constraint/composite masks use only direct candidate-feature predicates and apply false-if-any-false, true-if-all-true, otherwise-unknown conjunction. |
| **RM-05** | Context conditions remain USM Scope predicates and are not folded into classification. |
| **RM-06** | A guard designates exact declaration editions, evaluates the exact candidate, and does not treat a mask name as a kind synonym. |
| **RM-07** | Broad stable reuse triggers review for a separately identified local kind and an obtaining subkind relation; a declaration or catalog row does not perform promotion. |
| **RM-08** | Every guard-addressable RoleMask resolves durably to its exact declaration and dependency editions; an optional catalog represents those references and may consolidate redundant declarations without becoming ontology. |
| **RM-09** | Cross-context use establishes the exact KindBridge relation, target declarations, and any separate MaskAdapter episteme before evaluating the target masked judgment. |
| **RM-10** | RoleMask non-settlement yields target `unknown`; MaskAdapter non-settlement blocks the cross-context use without rewriting an independent target masked judgment; fail-closed is never `false`. |
