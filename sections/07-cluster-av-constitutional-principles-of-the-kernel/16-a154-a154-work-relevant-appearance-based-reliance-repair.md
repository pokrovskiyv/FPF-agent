## A.15.4 - Work-Relevant Appearance-Based Reliance Repair

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**At a glance.** Use `A.15.4` when a dashboard tile, credential view, copied approval, generated explanation, publication face, API response, source pointer, or weak indication is about to justify one exact work or reliance use, but that use's governing prerequisite is not yet recoverable. Name the attempted use first. Then add one `RequiredPositionEntries` row for each independently required direct object; a one-position repair has one row, while a use with several prerequisites keeps them in separate rows. Each row names its direct owner, direct-object kind, native project-side reference, required posture or currentness, and dependency on the attempted use. The repair record does not turn appearances or prerequisite rows into a new umbrella kind.

**Use this when.** Use this pattern when an acting user is ready to plan, start, continue, stop, or rely because a visible or copied appearance looks approved, current, safe, evidenced, delegated, released, or ready, but one exact attempted use still lacks one or more governing positions. Record every independently required position as its own `RequiredPositionEntries` row; do not place several patterns, kinds, or project refs into one field.

**First output.** One compact `A.15.4` local repair record:

```text
A.15.4 local repair record:
  RelianceAppearanceRef:
  RelianceAppearanceKind:
  WorkOrRelianceUseKind:
  WorkOrRelianceUseRef:
  RequiredPositionEntries:
    - EntryId:
      DirectOwnerPatternRef:
      DirectObjectKind:
      ProjectSideObjectRef:
      RequiredPostureOrCurrentness:
      DependencyOnAttemptedUse:
  AllowedUseNow:
  AppearanceOverreadBlocked:
  RecoveryOrStopCondition:
```

`RequiredPositionEntries` is a local row set, not a new record kind, prerequisite U-kind, or generic `U.EntityRef` list. Every `ProjectSideObjectRef` uses the native reference form of its `DirectOwnerPatternRef`; heterogeneous prerequisites remain separate rows.

**First repair use in practice.** Name what the encountered display, publication face, copied text, credential view, API response, pointer, or indication may safely do now: keep attention oriented, help find the direct owner in the §3 governing-position lookup (including its permission and authority branch when that is the live claim), preserve a weak indication through `A.16.1`, support planning only through a `U.WorkPlan`, proceed inside a recovered relation, or block only the unsupported work or reliance claim.

**What goes wrong if missed.** The reliance appearance starts acting as if it already proves approval, gate passage, evidence, assurance, performed work, currentness, or release authorization. Work then proceeds or stops while the governing pattern position that should carry the claim is missing, stale, revoked, or contradicted.

**Primary EntityOfConcern in plain terms.** One local repair relation for one exact attempted work or reliance use. It connects the reliance appearance and that attempted use to the smallest set of independently governed prerequisite entries, plus the safe current use and blocked appearance overread. The entries point to existing direct objects; they are not one new umbrella object.

**First repair checks.**
1. Name the reliance appearance's actual kind and publication position without treating its appearance as the governing pattern position or source relation itself.
2. Decide the live working moment: early attention to preserve, intended work to plan, reliance on already-performed work or a decision, or another operative relation for action now.
3. Fill `WorkOrRelianceUseKind` and `WorkOrRelianceUseRef`: the use being justified can be intended work, reliance on a claim, reliance on a performed-work occurrence, a work-relevant P2W claim, or a P2W chain position.
4. Create one `RequiredPositionEntries` row for each independently required direct object. This typed row set is the sole prerequisite set: a claim, instituted effect, gate decision, role assignment, evidence/currentness relation, plan, or other prerequisite each receives its own row. If permission or authority is current, first choose its exact object in the §3 branch, then fill the row's direct owner, direct-object kind, native project-side ref, required posture/currentness, and dependency on the attempted use. Never put comma-separated patterns, kinds, or refs into one field.
5. Follow dependencies through those direct objects. For permission or authority, use the dependency stated by the selected §3 row. An instituting act, enduring grant, conflict finding, gate decision, and work plan remain separate prerequisites; none substitutes for another row or inherits another row's posture.
6. Before allowing the attempted work or reliance, open every prerequisite through its typed reference. Check that the referenced relation actually obtains or the referenced result has the posture its owner requires; that it is current and covers this beneficiary, action, target, scope, and time window; and that any evidence or source relation required for this reliance is present. When a relevant permission/norm conflict exists, give its exact `PermissionNormConflictFinding@Context` a separate row: an `unresolved` or norm-selecting disposition blocks this use but does not make the grant cease to obtain. When policy separately requires an A.21 gate or A.15.5 work-entry-readiness relation, give each its own row and require a current passing or ready result. Naming a record is only the first recovery step. If any check fails, keep `AllowedUseNow` at the safe narrowed use.

**Not this pattern when.** Stay in A.15 when the question under repair is only `U.Role`, holder, context, `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.WorkPlan`, and `U.Work` separation. Stay in `A.15.2` for WorkPlan construction, `A.15.3` for planned slot-filling baselines, and `A.15.5` when the question is full-kit condition or work-entry readiness rather than a reliance appearance being used as a reason for work or reliance. Stay in `A.16.1` and `C.2.4` when the honest current value is pre-articulation cue preservation and articulation level. Stay in `C.16.Q` when dynamic-quality or evaluative wording is the current claim. Stay in `A.6.A` when the current claim is action invitation. Stay in E.17 when the question under repair is only publication-face exposure or multi-view publication. When the direct evidence, gate, constraint, boundary, permission/authority, work, or other claim is already known, use the owner selected by the §3 lookup instead of A.15.4.

**What this buys.** The acting engineer-manager can keep work moving without trusting appearances: use the reliance appearance for orientation or source-finding when that is all it can carry, proceed only inside the recovered relation when that relation exists, and turn repeated ambiguity into source-relation repair work rather than repeated manual reconstruction.

### A.15.4:1 - Problem Frame

Dashboards, credential views, generated explanations, copied approvals, provenance labels, green tiles, schema wording, API wording, and composed source-relation chains often look ready for work or reliance before the record or relation that carries the claim is visible. The practical problem is to decide what an engineer-manager may do now without turning appearance into approval or permission, gate passage, evidence, assurance, performed work, role-assignment currentness, role-state or credential-status currentness, or release authorization.

**Plain recognition line.** Let the dashboard tile, credential view, copied approval, generated explanation, publication face, API response, or pointer lead to the governing pattern position that must be checked. Do not let the reliance appearance become the relation, slot filler, or project-side reference that authorizes work or reliance.

**Reliance-appearance and claim/effect-position discipline.** In this pattern, `source` is not a generic kind. The governing value for the attempted use is the direct object selected by its owner: an actual relation occurrence, owner-defined decision/finding/status result, plan, Work occurrence, or claim about that object. A project record may be a `U.Episteme` that names the direct object, and a publication relation may expose that record; neither the record nor its display makes the direct object obtain. If no typed reference and owner-defined test can be recovered, keep the appearance at orientation, source-finding, cue-pack preservation, repair request, or bounded-probe use.

**Ontological unpacking of the local repair relation.** `A.15.4` does not introduce `U.Source`, `U.RequiredValue`, `WorkReliancePremise`, a generic cue head, or a generic visible-thing kind. It governs one dependent repair relation among already-governed values:
- `RelianceAppearanceRef` names the dashboard tile, credential view, copied wording, generated explanation, publication face, carrier, display, API wording, source-finding pointer, or low-articulation indication whose appearance is tempting the work or reliance use. Its actual kind is named separately in `RelianceAppearanceKind`, so the record can distinguish an episteme, episteme publication, publication face, carrier, display, copied wording, generated explanation, API wording, source-finding pointer, or low-articulation indication without making them one kind. If the live value is a preserve-worthy early cue, use `U.PreArticulationCuePack` under `A.16.1`.
- `WorkOrRelianceUseKind` and `WorkOrRelianceUseRef` name the use being justified: intended work, reliance on a claim, reliance on performed work, a work-relevant P2W claim, or a P2W chain position. These fields select the current branch; they do not create a durable kind.
- `RequiredPositionEntries` is the sole prerequisite set and contains one row per independently required direct object. Every row states `DirectOwnerPatternRef`, `DirectObjectKind`, the owner's native `ProjectSideObjectRef`, `RequiredPostureOrCurrentness`, and `DependencyOnAttemptedUse`. One row may point to a required claim, another to an instituting speech act, grant, conflict finding, gate decision, assignment, evidence/currentness relation, plan, or other direct object; the row set creates none of them and never turns a claim into an instituted effect.
- `AllowedUseNow` states what use remains admissible after repair, such as orientation, source-finding, bounded reversible probe, narrowed reliance, or proceed-inside-recovered-relation.
- `AppearanceOverreadBlocked` names the false use that the reliance appearance would create by appearance, for example treating a dashboard color as gate passage or a copied approval as a current speech act.
- `RecoveryOrStopCondition` names the first failed prerequisite and what must change. Before reopening, follow every typed ref and verify that the relation obtains or the result passes its owner-defined criterion, is current, covers the attempted beneficiary/action/target/scope/window, and has the evidence or source relation required for this reliance. When a relevant conflict exists, its separate `PermissionNormConflictFinding@Context` row must carry a current owner-defined disposition; an `unresolved` or norm-selecting result blocks the affected use without changing grant currentness. A named or complete-looking record is not enough.

Here `evidence relation`, `attestation relation`, and `currentness relation` mean `A.10` evidence-provenance, attestation, or currentness relations named by value. They are not work-procedure elements and do not carry authorization by their wording.

### A.15.4:2 - Problem - Cluster Boundary

A.15 remains the kernel for separating `U.Role`, holder and context, `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.WorkPlan`, and dated `U.Work`. A.15.4 starts only when a reliance appearance begins to justify a work claim or reliance claim and the team needs to recover the governing pattern position and project-side reference that carry that claim or effect. If the governing pattern and project-side reference are already known, use them directly and keep A.15.4 as the bounded repair relation.

### A.15.4:2.1 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Work momentum vs. governing-position recoverability | Teams need to keep work moving, but a reliance appearance can make the wrong claim look like work authorization when the governing pattern position is still unnamed. |
| Cheap first note vs. high-impact reliance | Routine source-finding should stay light, while release, safety, compliance, role-assignment, credential-status, role-state, and gate cases need more fields. |
| Publication face vs. governing pattern value | The visible carrier may be useful for orientation, but the work or reliance claim belongs to the project-side FPF kind and reference named by value. |
| Neighboring governed claims vs. local repair | A.15.4 can recover the missing governing pattern position for the attempted work or reliance use, but evidence, gate, assurance, boundary, work-occurrence, and the permission/authority object selected by the §3 branch return to their direct owners. |
| Repeated ambiguity vs. individual burden | Repeated ambiguity about the required claim, instituted effect, or governing position should become governing-position or source-relation repair work, not repeated manual reconstruction by every acting practitioner. |

### A.15.4:3 - Solution - Work-Relevant Appearance-Based Reliance Repair

#### Core stress-case rule

**Ordinary local repair record.** In ordinary use, do not build a full evidence, currentness, or provenance dossier. The first useful record is:

`RelianceAppearanceRef; RelianceAppearanceKind; WorkOrRelianceUseKind; WorkOrRelianceUseRef; RequiredPositionEntries; AllowedUseNow; AppearanceOverreadBlocked; RecoveryOrStopCondition`

The reliance appearance may be a tile, credential view, approval-looking memo, generated explanation, copied review, provenance mark, API wording, functional-description publication, or composed source-relation chain. The pattern asks whether every direct object required by the attempted use resolves and meets its owner-defined posture and currentness conditions, not merely whether a project-side reference is named or the reliance appearance is impressive, fluent, easy to inspect, or visually salient.

**Conditional governing pattern and position field set.** Use the fuller fields below only when the attempted use is release-, safety-, compliance-, gate-, or other high-impact reliance, or when any `RequiredPositionEntries` row identifies role assignment, credential status, role state, assurance, contested/external/cross-context reliance, currentness, revocation, generated or copied source relation, or another prerequisite whose owner requires those details. Select the depth from the attempted use and typed rows, not from a parallel claim/effect field. These fields are local repair aids, not a new record kind.

| Field | Working question |
| --- | --- |
| subject or actor | Who or what would perform the work, rely on the appearance, hold the credential-status or role-state, or be affected by the claim? |
| role-assignment claim | Which `U.RoleAssignment` or role-context claim is being made? |
| intended work or work target | Is the user planning intended work, relying on a dated `U.Work` occurrence or result, or making another reliance claim? Name that branch and the governing pattern before the reliance appearance guides it. |
| affected resource or claim | Which resource, claim, gate, credential, credential-status, role-state, evidence, approval, or source-finding pointer with authority-reference relation is supposedly affected? |
| context | Which bounded context, environment, project slice, API setting, connector setting, protocol setting, or relying situation makes the claim applicable? |
| policy or gate version | Which policy, gate profile, constraint version, method version, or register edition is supposed to govern the claim? |
| time window | During which window is the claim, effect, source relation, or recovered-use boundary claimed to hold? |
| currentness or revocation field | Is the source relation current, stale, revoked, superseded, expired, contradicted, or unknown? |
| issuer or governing reference | Which issuer, project reference, register entry, source-currentness or credential-status record, speech act, gate decision, evidence relation, or work-occurrence record is required by the governing pattern for the current use? |
| verifier or relying context | Who is checking or relying on the claim, and in which context? |
| evidence or attestation relation | Which `A.10` evidence, provenance, or attestation relation, if any, justifies the claim without itself becoming approval, gate passage, assurance, or work occurrence? |
| sourceRelationClass | Which `E.17:5.1b` source-relation class or claim-use class applies to the reliance appearance and required claim or use? |
| unsupported effect | Which requested work claim, reliance claim, governing value, or downstream effect remains unsupported and needs narrowing, repair, reopening, probing, or blocking? |

Start with the A.15.4 first repair checks above when the reliance appearance is being used as a reason for intended work, reliance, or a work-relevant claim. If the direct question is already known, use the §3 lookup and go straight to its owner; permission or authority uses the single branch there. Use A.15.4 only when the governing pattern position and project-side reference must still be recovered before role assignment, method, plan, work, work result, result measurement, or another work or reliance claim can proceed.

**When a reliance appearance seems to authorize work or reliance.** Use A.15.4 when a publication, display, credential view, wording, or explanation looks like permission, prohibition, readiness, or evidence for intended work or reliance. This is a recognition moment, not a new kind. The repair question remains: what does the user intend to do next, what claim or effect would make that intended work or reliance admissible, and which governing pattern position and project-side reference are required for it?

Here "authority-looking case" is only a recognition phrase for the encountered situation. The record, relation, slot filler, or project-side reference that authorizes, forbids, records, or carries the required relation is named by value under its FPF pattern. Use `E.17:5.1c` for the shared meanings of `orientation use`, `reliance use`, operative claim, unsupported downstream use, and `reopen trigger`; use `E.17:5.1d` when the primary question under repair belongs to another governing pattern.

The central behaviour is: name the work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, or P2W chain position under repair; name the governing pattern position and project-side reference that carry the required claim, effect, work occurrence, or currentness value; keep the `U.Episteme` or `U.EpistemePublication` distinct from publication form, MVPK face, publication carrier, rendering, and source-finding cue; choose the minimum sufficient recovered use; and do not raise the claim beyond the recovered relation, source relation, or recovered use boundary. If a project record names a governing relation, follow its typed ref to the direct owner and test obtaining, required result posture, currentness, scope, and evidence for this attempted use; the record's statement does not make the relation obtain.

**Positive repaired disposition.** First name the attempted use and open each prerequisite through its typed ref. The appearance may guide that use beyond orientation only after every referenced relation actually obtains or result passes its owner-defined criterion, is current, covers this beneficiary/action/target/scope/window, and has the evidence or source relation required for this reliance. When a relevant permission/norm conflict exists, its separate finding row must be current and settled for this use; an `unresolved` or norm-selecting disposition blocks the use without rewriting grant currentness. Then write what may happen next. The first failed row keeps only that unsupported work or reliance use blocked.

Reliance dispositions by recovered governing pattern relation:

| Work or reliance disposition | Use when | Minimum useful record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orientation or source-finding note | The reliance appearance is only a publication face, publication carrier, rendering, cue, retrieval cue, learning aid, or reversible local probe trigger. | Name the appearance and exact attempted use, then add one `RequiredPositionEntries` row for the first missing direct object. Keep `AllowedUseNow`, the blocked overread, and the recovery or stop condition explicit. |
| Routine reliance note | The team needs ordinary bounded reliance without release, safety, compliance, delegated role-assignment claim, role-state claim, credential-status claim, contested source relation, or cross-context reuse. | Name the work or reliance use and only the `RequiredPositionEntries` rows it actually depends on, plus acting holder, work-performing system, or agent when current; `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned authority or work attribution is current; affected target, context, effective window; `AllowedUseNow`; and reopen trigger. |
| High-impact reliance disposition | The attempted use is external-impact, irreversible, release-bearing, gate-bearing, compliance-bearing, safety-bearing, delegated, revoked, role-state-claim-bearing, credential-status-claim-bearing, generated-source-mediated, copied-source-mediated, provenance-mediated, contested, or cross-context; or one typed prerequisite row has that owner's high-impact conditions. | Use the governing fields required by the attempted use and those exact `RequiredPositionEntries` rows. When permission or authority is current, choose exactly one row in the §3 branch rather than copying its owner catalogue here. |

A small A.15.4 local repair record is enough for the first disposition:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `RelianceAppearanceRef` | Name the appearance being relied on by value, such as the dashboard tile, credential view, copied text, generated explanation, publication face, publication carrier, rendering, or source-finding cue. |
| `RelianceAppearanceKind` | Name the kind without granting authority by appearance: actual `U.Episteme`, actual `U.EpistemePublication`, publication form, MVPK face, publication carrier, rendering, `PublicationUnit`, dashboard tile, credential view, generated wording, copied wording, or source-finding cue. |
| `WorkOrRelianceUseKind` and `WorkOrRelianceUseRef` | Name the use being justified by value: intended work, reliance on a claim, reliance on a dated `U.Work` occurrence, method-family selection, selected method, method of work, work plan, planned work, work result, result measurement, release reliance decision, non-work reliance claim, work-relevant P2W claim, or P2W chain position. A planned baseline remains a `U.WorkPlan` or `U.WorkPlanning` plan record; performed work becomes `U.Work` only after it occurs and is recorded under `A.15.1`; work-result measurement belongs with the evidence relation or result-measurement record that carries it. |
| `RequiredPositionEntries` | This is the sole prerequisite set. Add one row per independent direct object, whether it is a claim, instituted effect, relation occurrence, owner-defined result, gate decision, assignment, evidence/currentness relation, plan, or other prerequisite. Each row names its `DirectOwnerPatternRef`, exact `DirectObjectKind`, native typed `ProjectSideObjectRef`, `RequiredPostureOrCurrentness`, and `DependencyOnAttemptedUse`. Never store several patterns, kinds, or refs as comma-separated prose, and never coerce the refs into one generic `U.EntityRef` list. |
| `AllowedUseNow` | State the safe current use. `proceed-inside-recovered-relation` is allowed only after every required entry passes its `RequiredPostureOrCurrentness` and exact-use match; otherwise retain orientation, source-finding, bounded probe, repair request, narrowed reliance, or blocked unsupported use. |
| `AppearanceOverreadBlocked` | State the overread being blocked, such as treating display color as gate passage, copied approval as a current speech act, a credential screenshot as permission, or a generated explanation as evidence. |
| `RecoveryOrStopCondition` | Write the first row that fails and the observation that would make it pass. Reopen only after following every typed ref and verifying that its relation obtains or its result passes the owner-defined criterion, is current, covers the attempted use, and has the evidence/source support required for this reliance. Include separately required current conflict-finding, gate, and work-entry-readiness rows; an unresolved conflict row blocks the affected use without changing grant currentness. |

**Borrowed episteme and publication discipline.** A.15.4 borrows the `C.2.1`, `E.17`, and `A.16.0` distinction rather than minting a new generic `U.*` kind. The claim-bearing FPF kind here is `U.Episteme`; `U.EpistemePublication` is used only when that episteme is available as a published episteme with MVPK-face references. Publication forms, MVPK faces, publication carriers, renderings, `PublicationUnit` instances, and source-finding cues are separate kinds or relation positions in the case. A planned baseline remains a `U.WorkPlan` or `U.WorkPlanning` plan record such as `SlotFillingsPlanItem`; launch values and finalization values remain their own project records, decision logs remain gate or decision records, performed-work evidence remains evidence, and dated work occurrences remain `A.15.1` or `U.Work` matters.

When the governing pattern position is incomplete, choose one relation-governed `A.15.4` disposition after naming the work or reliance use and the exact direct objects it requires in `RequiredPositionEntries`; pick the lightest disposition that preserves practical work and recoverability:

1. Use the reliance appearance only for orientation or source-finding.
2. Reopen the source `U.Episteme` for the current claim, the `U.EpistemePublication` that exposes the claim-bound source relation, register entry, governing record, or governing relation, or refresh source-currentness, credential-status, role-state, context-state, or another currentness relation.
3. Narrow the acting holder, work-performing system, agent, `RoleAssignmentRef` when current, requested operation or work class, affected work target, affected resource, affected claim, context, and effective window until the recovered record or relation really covers the recovered use.
4. Run a bounded reversible probe under an explicit `U.WorkPlan` when no external-impact reliance is being made.
5. Ask the holder, work-performing system, maintainer, verifier, issuer, or project role holder identified by the relevant `RoleAssignmentRef` or governing relation to expose or repair the missing direct object named in that `RequiredPositionEntries` row. Keep any additional missing gate, evidence, assignment, state, currentness, or boundary object in its own row.
6. Repair the `U.WorkPlan`, `U.MethodDescription`, dashboard label, source-relation link, or boundary wording that made the overread plausible.
7. Proceed only inside the recovered scope and window.
8. Block only the work claim or reliance claim that lacks the required relation.

#### Repair assignment rule

**Missing record or relation repair assignment.** If the required governing record or relation is unavailable to the acting user, assign only prospective repair work, request work, decision work, work-plan work, or source-relation gap work to the holder, work-performing system, maintainer, verifier, or project role holder identified by the relevant `RoleAssignmentRef` or governing pattern relation for the missing relation. The acting user records the blocked work claim or reliance claim, the missing relation, and the safe narrowed use now.

**Reliance-appearance kind check.** First name the actual kind of the reliance appearance: episteme, episteme publication, publication form, carrier, rendering, dashboard tile, credential view, generated/copied wording, or source-finding cue. If it exposes a typed ref, follow that ref to the direct owner and test the owner's obtaining or result criterion. If it exposes only a face, carrier, wording, or record entry, use it for orientation/source-finding until the direct object and evidence/currentness relation are recovered.

**Source-relation guard.** Release urgency, delegated-claim urgency, compliance concern, color, salience, copied wording, or generated wording does not replace the source relation named by value. A dashboard tile may guide release only as a current view of the relevant `GateDecision` plus evidence relation, currentness relation, scope, and window.

#### Governing-position lookup table

Governing patterns by required direct-object kind:

- cue-only orientation: use only for attention, learning, source-finding, or a reversible local probe trigger; stay with `A.16`, `A.16.1`, or `A.6.A` when those claims are being made.
**Permission and authority branch — use only when that is the live claim.** Do not route from *approved*, *authorized*, *allowed*, *may*, or the look of a permit. Ask what is true now and choose one row.

| Plain question | Direct owner and object | What closes or blocks this branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Did an admitted system actually perform an approval, authorization, delegation, grant, or revocation communication under its covering assignment? | `A.2.9`; one actual `SA : U.SpeechAct` occurrence. | Recover the occurrence, performer system, obtaining assignment, context, time, act type, and evidence needed for reliance. A `SpeechActRecord`, message, or carrier is not the act, and the act alone does not make an institutional effect obtain. |
| Does a policy-valid strong grant currently obtain for this beneficiary and action? | `A.2.8.PER`; one `GrantedPermissionRelation@Context` occurrence. | Match beneficiary, action specification, policy/context, scope/window, and instituting `SpeechActRef`. A valid revocation, supersession, or policy failure may prevent or end the grant. An unresolved same-case conflict can block this attempted use without making the grant cease to obtain; keep those results separate. This is the permission-side instituted effect. |
| Before action, did a current frame complete enough for this use contain no applicable prohibition? | `A.2.8.PER`; one `NonProhibitionFinding@Context`. | Name the frame, use, beneficiary/action, scope/window, and evaluation. A stale or incomplete frame returns `unresolved`, not permission. |
| Did dated Work actually exercise one obtaining grant? | `A.2.8.PER`; one `PermissionExerciseRelation@Context` occurrence. | The Work must match the grant's action and the actual performer must satisfy its beneficiary branch. No dated Work means no exercise; non-exercise is not violation. |
| After Work, did a current sufficiently complete frame find no applicable violation? | `A.2.8.PER`; one `NonViolationFinding@Context`. | Name the actual Work, evaluation Work, frame, scope/window, and result. Exercise or non-exercise alone settles nothing; a stale or incomplete frame returns `unresolved`. |
| Do an obtaining grant and a current norm reach incompatible conclusions for the same beneficiary/action and overlapping scope/window? | `A.2.8.PER`; one `PermissionNormConflictFinding@Context`. | Cite the applicable precedence rule or an authorized dated decision Work and current resolution result. Otherwise keep the conflict `unresolved` and block the affected use. |
| Is an accountable subject obliged, prohibited, or given a recommendation-as-duty? | `A.2.8`; one `U.Commitment`. | Name the accountable subject, modality, referents, scope/window, and instituting act when provenance matters. The utterance, record, and carrier are not the commitment. |

A gate or readiness result remains an additional `A.21` or `A.15.5` prerequisite; it creates none of these objects. If the issue is only wording, classify it through `A.6` or the single permission-word branch in `A.6.B`. If only a permit, badge, message, record, or tile is visible, stay at orientation/source-finding until one row above can be supported.
- role-assignment, role-state, credential-status, or context-state reliance: cite `A.2.1`, `U.RoleAssignment`, a state-changing `U.SpeechAct`, a governing context-state record, a credential proof or credential-status result under `A.10`, or an `A.21` `GateDecision` when the state is gate-governed.
- boundary, policy, API, schema, "allowed", "authorized", "approved", "recommended", or "guaranteed" wording: split the statement through `A.6` or `A.6.B`. When its live job is permission or authority, return to the branch above; the displayed word does not choose the object.
- gate decision or gate passage: cite `A.21` `OperationalGate(profile)`, `GateDecision`, `GateDecisionRationale`, `DecisionLogRef`, gate profile, gate version, check set, scope, window, and replay or freshness pins.
- Flow constraint-validity witness: cite `A.20` `ConstraintValidity` status, witness, `GateCheckRef.aspect = ConstraintValidity`, `PathId` or `PathSliceId` when applicable, window, sentinel, and pins when those fields are needed for the claim.
- release, deployment, repair, inspection, or rollback work occurrence: cite `A.15.1` dated `U.Work` occurrence and the `A.10` evidence or provenance relation when reliance on occurrence is needed.
- evidence, provenance, authenticity, currentness, copied-source, or generated-source relation: apply `A.10` and name the claim-bound evidence relation, currentness relation, and relation-governed or blocked use.
- assurance, safety, compliance, trust, release confidence, or `R`, `F`, `G`, or `CL` increase: apply `B.3` and name the typed assurance claim plus its limitations and reopen condition. If the word `ready` names full-kit or work-entry readiness, use `A.15.5`; if it names a gate decision, use `A.21`.
- generated explanation: use `E.17.EFP` for explanation faithfulness or source-finding relation, then require `A.10` claim-bound source relation for every operative claim that will be relied on.
- ambiguous approval, permission, or authorization wording: use the permission and authority branch above and choose by the plain question it answers now, never by the displayed word.

Recovered governing pattern outputs for A.15.4 closure:
| Governing pattern or relation used | Recovered output for this A.15.4 repair | A.15.4-local use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A.6` or `A.6.B` | Typed claim IDs (`L-*`, `A-*`, `D-*`, and `E-*`) plus the pattern that governs the current boundary claim or the current effect-bearing claim. | Use for wording, boundary, API, schema, or use-boundary recovery before intended work or reliance. |
| `A.10` | Claim-bound evidence relation, freshness field, currentness field, and relation-governed or blocked use for the attempted claim. | Use for evidence, provenance, authenticity, credential-currentness, copied-source, or generated-source recovery. |
| `B.3` | Typed assurance claim, no-assurance-use disposition, or rejected or downgraded assurance claim. | Use only when the work or reliance claim under repair relies on a typed assurance claim. |
| `A.21` | `OperationalGate(profile)`, `GateDecision`, `DecisionLogRef`, gate profile, gate version, scope, window, and replay or freshness pins. | Use for gate-passage reliance in the named scope and window. |
| `A.20` | `ConstraintValidity` status, witness, `PathId` or `PathSliceId` when applicable, window, sentinel, and pins when those fields are needed for the claim. | Use for flow constraint-validity reliance. |
| Permission or authority is current | Use the single branch above and carry the selected owner's native object with its own closing conditions. | Do not mint or cite a generic permission-result object. |
| `A.15.1` | Dated `U.Work` occurrence plus `A.10` evidence or provenance relation when relied on. | Use for reliance on performed work. |
| `E.17.EFP` | Explanation class, source-finding relation, and faithfulness relation over the source `U.Episteme` or the `U.EpistemePublication` exposing that source relation. | Use for generated-explanation faithfulness and source-finding before operative reliance. |

High-impact work or reliance - especially external-impact, irreversible, release-bearing, role-assignment-bearing, role-state-claim-bearing, credential-status-claim-bearing, gate-bearing, compliance-bearing, safety-bearing, delegated, contested, or assurance-bearing claim or effect - may guide work only for the acting holder, work-performing system, or agent, the `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned capacity or attribution is current, the work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, P2W chain position under repair, affected work target or claim, audience, scope, environment, version, policy context, operational mode, and time window for which the required FPF-governed project-side source relation, evidence relation, gate decision, or assurance claim is recoverable. Cue-only, source-finding, learning, and bounded reversible probes stay lightweight and do not require a full evidence, currentness, or provenance dossier.
Quick dispositions:

| Encountered case | First `A.15.4` disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Release dashboard tile exposing a source relation | If the tile is a current dashboard view of `A.21` `GateDecision` or `DecisionLogRef` plus release scope or work target, environment, scope, window, gate profile, gate version, and `A.10` evidence relation, it may carry gate-passage reliance for that release and environment. |
| Release dashboard tile without current gate or evidence relation | Use the tile only for display or source-finding until the current `A.21` `GateDecision` or `DecisionLogRef`, release scope or work target, environment or scope, time window, gate profile, gate version, and `A.10` evidence relation are recoverable. Open `B.3` only when an assurance claim is being made. |
| Copied review summary or copied approval | Treat it as copied wording and a currentness cue. If the intended use relies on permission or authority, use the single branch above and follow only its selected direct owner. Gate passage still needs the `A.21` decision, performed work still needs the dated `A.15.1` occurrence, and reliance needs the applicable `A.10` evidence/currentness relation. |
| Delegation chain with forwarded approval | Each link names delegator, delegatee, delegated operation or work class, affected work target, affected resource, affected claim, scope, window, the delegation record or relation permitting delegation, subdelegation allowance if any, revocation relation, currentness relation, and evidence relation. A forwarded approval is not delegated authority by copy alone. |
| Role-assignment, revocation, role-state, or credential-status display | Resolve to role assignment, state-changing speech act, context-state record, credential proof or credential-status result, or gate decision with freshness field, revocation relation, or revocation record; visual display cannot defeat a higher-priority revocation or supersession relation. |
| Conflicting source relations | Do not resolve by color, visual salience, copied wording, or apparent recency. Name source-relation order, governing decision record, freshness policy, and supersession rule; the work claim, reliance claim, or effect is contested until resolved, while source-finding and bounded reversible probes remain available. |
| Credential badge or register-backed credential-status view | Treat the display as a publication of a register-entry episteme. Before relying, recover separately: the exact entry and its publication relation; the constitutive policy/rule; the admitted system and covering assignment for any authorized entry-producing speech act, the actual matching Work for an exercise claim, or the evaluation Work required for a finding; the actual direct relation/finding selected by its owner; and the evidence/currentness/revocation relation. The entry is authoritative source only under the named rule for the exact claim or effect that rule governs. An institutional effect still needs the authorized Work that the rule makes constitutive; a finding still needs its owner-defined evaluation. Inscription alone performs no Work, institutes no effect, and creates neither exercise nor non-violation. |
| Rollback command-like cue | Treat as cue or `A.6.A`-governed invitation unless command record, authorization, work occurrence, performed-work result, or gate decision is recoverable. |
| Generated explanation says "authorized" | Use the explanation only to find source publications, claim-bound source relations, or governing positions. If permission or authority is the live claim, route through the single branch above. The explanation itself supplies none of that branch's objects and proves neither gate passage nor performed work. |
| Extracted source publication, rewrite, representation shift, explanation, then gate or release claim | Return to the source `U.EpistemePublication`, source-bearing relation, transform record, evidence relation, explanation relation, or governing pattern position at the first lossy or non-commutative transformation operation; the gate claim or release claim waits for the required transform record, evidence relation, explanation relation, gate decision, or assurance claim. |
| Repeated green-tile failures without recoverable source relation | Treat recurrence as upstream source-relation repair work: expose decision refs, fix dashboard semantics, add claim-bound source relations and currentness, revise boundary wording, or add review cues so the acting user is not repeatedly forced to reconstruct missing source relation. |

### A.15.4:3.1 - Archetypal Grounding - Worked Dashboard And Approval Examples

Worked dashboard and approval slice:

A release dashboard shows a green approval-looking tile for `Release-2026.05.08-prod`. If the tile is a current view of the relevant `GateDecisionRef` plus evidence relation and currentness relation, it may carry bounded gate-passage reliance for that release scope and window. A claim that deployment happened still requires a dated `A.15.1` work occurrence plus the evidence or provenance relation needed for the relying context. If the gate reference is missing or stale, treat the tile as orientation and source-finding until the team can name the release-work claim under repair, release-work position under repair, governing pattern for the claim or effect, and governing-position fields for the gate decision, evidence relation, and currentness relation.

| Step | Required record or relation |
| --- | --- |
| Required project claim or effect kind | Release reliance, gate passage, compliance proof, assurance increase, evidence relation, or currentness relation. |
| Gate decision record | Cite the current `A.21` `GateDecision` or `DecisionLogRef`, gate profile, gate version, release scope or work target, scope, window, and replay or freshness pins. Without that record, the tile is not release authorization or gate passage. |
| Flow constraint-validity witness | Cite `A.20` `ConstraintValidity` status or witness only when the claim is about flow constraint validity, not about the gate decision itself. |
| Evidence and currentness relation | Use `A.10` for the dashboard query, publication-carrier integrity, evidence refs, time, window, freshness field, revocation relation or revocation record, verifier context, relying context, and rival explanation such as stale display or copied status. |
| Assurance claim | Use `B.3` only if the tile is being used to raise readiness, compliance, trust, safety, release confidence, `R`, `F`, `G`, or `CL`; otherwise no assurance tuple is being claimed. |
| Repaired gate-use reliance | With the decision and evidence relation recovered, rely on gate passage only for the named release scope or work target, environment, gate profile, gate version, time, and window; a claim that deployment happened still needs a dated `A.15.1` work occurrence plus the evidence or provenance relation needed for the relying context. |
| Blocked overreads | The dashboard color does not create approval, deontic permission, compliance proof, rollback success, work occurrence, or assurance by display. |

Approval memo green-tile case:

An approval memo may carry an approval claim when it exposes the `A.2.9` `SpeechActRef`, acting holder, work-performing system, or agent, `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned authority is claimed, affected release scope or work target, judgement context, time, window, publication-carrier refs, evidence refs, and instituted effect being claimed. That carries only the bounded approval use governed by `A.2.9`. It does not prove that release, deployment, rollback, or other work occurred; that performed-work claim still needs the dated `A.15.1` work occurrence plus any `A.10` evidence relation required for the relying context.

Credential-status and role-state green-tile case:

A credential, credential-status, or role-state response is a publication of a claim-bearing register entry, not the status or relation itself. It may serve as authoritative source only when the named register rule identifies the exact entry, issuer, subject/holder binding, relying context, freshness/window, authorized entry-producing Work, and exact direct effect for which that Work is constitutive. The selected direct owner still decides whether that relation obtains or finding is warranted, and `A.10` carries the evidence/currentness use. The response never supplies release, Work occurrence, gate passage, permission/authority, or evaluation result merely by being present.

Situation viewpoint prompts:

| Viewpoint or repair concern | Prompt |
| --- | --- |
| Acting practitioner | What can I safely do next without turning the encountered episteme or episteme publication into unsupported work or reliance justification? |
| Release engineer | Which `A.21` gate decision, decision log, release scope, work target, and `A.15.1` work occurrence are separate here? |
| Issuer, gate, evidence, or role-assignment steward | Which source-currentness value, role-state value, credential-status value, decision ref, or evidence relation needs exposure or repair? |
| Audit or peer-review viewpoint | Which direct owner and object in the governing-position lookup must be recoverable? If permission or authority is current, which one row in that branch answers the live question? |
| Boundary claimant | Which words need typed claim IDs before they can guide work or reliance? |
| Manager | Is repeated ambiguity governing-position repair work rather than another manual check for the acting practitioner? |
| LLM user or tool user | Which governing pattern position or source relation does the explanation help find, and which operative claims still need an `A.10` claim-bound source relation? |
| Security or compliance steward | Which revocation relation, currentness relation, proof, credential-status record, role-state record, source-relation order, or supersession relation needs exposure? |
| Model or data documentation steward | Which intended use, evaluation condition, version, window, limitation, and evidence relation bound the model or data documentation? |
| Assurance viewpoint | Which named claim actually has a `B.3` assurance claim, with what assurance tuple, evidence relation, limitations, and reopen condition? |

Search cues for A.15.4 include: approval, approval-looking display, authorization, authorization-looking display, permission, permission display, allowed wording, green dashboard, release tile, release readiness, model card, datasheet, data card, provenance, provenance mark, attestation, attestation label, credential, credential badge, generated explanation, copied review, copied approval, review summary, compliance-looking mark, delegation, delegation display, revocation, revocation status, gate passed, gate passage, rollback successful, rollback cue, and assurance label. These are retrieval cues only; decide the governing pattern position, governing pattern, and project-side reference from the work or reliance question under repair, not from the displayed word, publication-carrier name, or source name.

Work and reliance disposition table for authority-looking cases:

| Question under repair | Start in | First useful output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can this episteme publication, publication face, publication carrier, rendering, or cue guide work or reliance by appearance? | `A.15.4` | Work or reliance use, claim/effect position, project-side claim/effect reference, and minimum relation-governed use. |
| Is the problem boundary, policy, API, schema, or connector wording? | `A.6` or `A.6.B` | Typed `L-*`, `A-*`, `D-*`, and `E-*` claims before the work claim or reliance claim is used. |
| Is the problem evidence, currentness, provenance, credential-status, generated-source relation, copied-source relation, or source-chain recovery? | `A.10` | Claim-bound evidence relation, currentness relation, and relation-governed or blocked use. |
| Is the problem assurance, readiness, safety, compliance, trust, release confidence, or change in `R`, `F`, `G`, or `CL`? | `B.3` | Typed assurance claim, no-assurance-use disposition, or downgraded or rejected assurance use. |

Display guidance for bounded credential-status or role-state: a visible state label meant to guide work should expose source type, reference or link named by value, freshness, window, scope, unsupported work claim, unsupported reliance claim, and unsupported effect. For example, prefer `Gate check passed; GateDecisionRef; release scope; environment; window; not compliance proof, rollback success, or assurance increase` over a bare approval-looking label.

Incident-learning fields for authority-looking overread: encountered episteme or episteme publication, work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, or P2W chain position under repair, governing pattern and governing pattern position for the claim or effect, acting holder, work-performing system, or agent, `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned capacity or attribution is current, affected work target or claim, context, window, missing or stale source `U.Episteme` for the current claim, `U.EpistemePublication` exposing the claim-bound source relation, register entry, or project-side reference; governing FPF relation and, when role-conditioned repair responsibility is current, the `RoleAssignmentRef` identifying the holder or project role holder responsible for exposing or repairing that missing value, plausible overread, safe disposition used now, and upstream repair work for the source `U.Episteme`, dashboard, explanation, credential view, boundary wording, publication face, or publication carrier.

Contestability and redress relation: when an authority-looking case affects person or team role-state, credential-status, access, assignment, responsibility, release blockage, compliance claim, or safety-impacting work, name the review relation or redress relation before the work claim or reliance claim hardens. The relation should name the disputed source relation or claim, the holder, maintainer, verifier, or project role holder identified by the relevant `RoleAssignmentRef` for refreshing or correcting that relation or record, the evidence relation or state-currentness relation to reopen, the safe interim disposition, and the time and window for review.

Lintable overread cues:

| Lint signal | Governing relation named by value |
| --- | --- |
| `approved`, `authorized`, `allowed`, `recommended`, or `guaranteed` in boundary, API, schema, or policy wording | Split through `A.6` or `A.6.B`; when permission or authority is the live claim, use the single branch above instead of routing from the word. |
| Dashboard tile, credential-status color, role-state color, or release tile used as release evidence or gate passage | Require `A.21` `GateDecision` or `DecisionLogRef` plus `A.10` evidence relation and currentness relation. |
| Register screenshot, badge, or entry used as permission, authority, role/state, or gate evidence | Require five separate recoveries: register-entry episteme and its publication relation; constitutive rule; authorized entry-producing Work, actual exercised Work, or evaluation Work as the selected owner requires; direct relation/finding under that owner; and `A.10` evidence/currentness. The entry may be authoritative source for the rule's exact claim or effect, but inscription creates neither actual exercise nor a non-violation finding. |
| Generated explanation uses `authorized`, `approved`, or similar wording | Use `E.17.EFP` for explanation/source-finding and `A.10` for the claim-bound source relation; if permission or authority is current, choose one row in the single branch above. |
| Model card, datasheet, label, or note cited as readiness, safety, compliance, or release confidence | Require a typed `B.3` assurance claim, intended-use match, evaluation condition, limitations, and `A.10` evidence relation. Use `A.15.5` instead when the current claim is full-kit or work-entry readiness. |
| Provenance or attestation label cited as truth, safety, release, permission, or authority | Require the bounded `A.10` provenance/process-trace claim plus the direct owner of the relied-on truth, safety, release, permission, or authority claim. For the last two, use the single branch above; the label is not its result. |
| Evidence, assurance, gate, or work-occurrence words without the governing pattern value that carries that claim or effect | Recover the `A.10` evidence relation, `B.3` assurance claim, `A.21` gate decision, or `A.15.1` work-occurrence record respectively before the work claim or reliance claim is used. |

Stress cases for practice:

| Case | Expected A.15.4 disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Green release dashboard tile with no `GateDecisionRef`. | Source-finding only; recover `A.21` decision or decision log plus `A.10` evidence before gate-passage reliance. |
| Copied approval from last month. | Treat the copy as a source-finding cue; use the permission/authority branch above to choose the one live question, then recover currentness and evidence for that selected object. |
| Credential badge screenshot after revocation. | Recover the register-entry episteme, its publication relation, named status rule, authorized entry-producing Work, direct status relation, and evidence/currentness/revocation relation separately. The revoked direct relation blocks reliance even when the entry remains visible. |
| Register entry says `grant exercised; no violation`, but no dated matching Work or evaluation Work is recoverable. | Keep both claims blocked. For exercise, recover dated Work and show that its action and performer satisfy the obtaining grant. For non-violation, recover the evaluation Work and current sufficiently complete frame. Inscription establishes neither result. |
| Generated explanation says `authorized by policy`. | Use `E.17.EFP` for explanation/source-finding and `A.10` for the claim-bound source relation; if permission or authority is current, choose and verify one row in the single branch above. |
| Boundary wording says `guaranteed approved for production`. | Split the sentence through `A.6` or `A.6.B`; use `A.6.C` for agreement-like or promise-bearing content and the single permission/authority branch above only for the permission or authority claim that remains. |
| Dashboard says green while decision log says blocked. | Treat as conflicting source relations; name source-relation order, governing decision record, freshness policy, and supersession rule before the work claim or reliance claim is used. |
| CRISPR lab dashboard says the guide edit is ready. | Treat the dashboard as orientation or source-finding until the protocol publication or protocol record, approval record or gate record, role-assignment record, evidence relation, current lab context record, and `U.WorkPlan` for the intended edit are recoverable. If the question is full-kit or work-entry readiness for the intended edit, use `A.15.5`; the readiness tile still does not create biological-intervention authorization, deontic permission, safety, or performed work. |

### A.15.4:3.2 - Archetypal Grounding - High-Impact Reliance-Repair Slice

A lab manager sees a green tile for `CRISPR-guide-G42 ready` and a copied message saying the edit is approved. `A.15.4` does not ask the manager to decide whether the tile is a good UI. It asks what work or reliance claim is about to be made.

```

**Named-but-revoked grant near-miss.** Suppose `B17-InterventionGrant` and its complete-looking record are present, but policy-valid `B17-GrantRevocation` took effect before the intervention window. The `B17-GRANT` entry then fails `RequiredPostureOrCurrentness` because the grant no longer obtains. A current protocol, plan, `GateDecision=pass`, readiness result, and green tile do not repair that failure: `AllowedUseNow` remains source-finding and prerequisite repair, and the intervention stays blocked.

### A.15.4:4.1 - Bias-Annotation

A.15.4 corrects appearance-based reliance. A publication face, dashboard tile, credential view, generated explanation, copied approval, provenance mark, schema wording, or API response can look ready for work before the governing pattern position and project-side FPF reference are named. The pattern keeps the reliance appearance separate from the source relation or other governing relation that carries the claim.

It also corrects over-repair bias. Not every reliance appearance being used as a reason for work or reliance needs a full dossier. The local repair record names the reliance appearance, attempted use, sole typed prerequisite set, allowed current use, blocked appearance overread, and recovery or stop condition at the smallest useful depth selected from that use and those rows.

### A.15.4:4 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement (Normative Predicate) | Purpose and Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A15.4-1 (One attempted use; typed prerequisite entries)** | Before an appearance guides work or reliance, a conforming use names one exact `WorkOrRelianceUseRef` and one `RequiredPositionEntries` row per independently required object. Every row supplies the direct owner, exact direct-object kind, native project-side ref, required posture/currentness, and dependency on the attempted use. A one-position repair has one row; a multi-prerequisite repair never stores comma-separated patterns, kinds, or refs and never coerces them into a generic `U.EntityRef` list. If any required row is absent or fails its posture, `AllowedUseNow` stays at the safe narrowed use. | Keeps every field fillable and every prerequisite under its direct owner. |
| **CC-A15.4-2 (P2W publication use boundary)** | A principle scheme, functional diagram, scenario, screen, or explanation that exposes a P2W chain guides only the `A.15` work or planning kind selected by the project use: method-family selection, selected method, `U.WorkPlan`, dated `U.Work`, work-result record, or result measurement. Claims outside that selected use require their own governing pattern position or source relation named by value. | Keeps P2W publication use tied to the work use under repair instead of turning publication form into project authority. |
| **CC-A15.4-3 (Lowering and refresh)** | When the governing pattern, governing pattern position, source-currentness relation, revocation relation, affected work target, relying context, or time window cannot be recovered, the disposition for the work or reliance claim is orientation, source-finding, contested use, bounded reversible probe, repair request, or blocked unsupported claim. The record states the return or refresh condition for changes to source currentness, revocation, governing decision, evidence relation, role-state register, credential-status register, context-state record, copied-source relation, generated-source relation, or publication relation. | Keeps A.15.4 useful without admitting source as a new kind. |
| **CC-A15.4-4 (Exact reopening judgment)** | Naming is only the first recovery step. Before `AllowedUseNow` permits the attempted use, follow every typed ref and verify that its relation obtains or its owner-defined result says pass/ready, is current, covers the beneficiary/action/target/scope/window, and has evidence/source support required for this reliance. A relevant `PermissionNormConflictFinding@Context` has its own row and current owner-defined disposition; an `unresolved` or norm-selecting result blocks the affected use but does not make a separately obtaining grant cease. Any separately required A.21 gate and A.15.5 work-entry-readiness relation is current and passes its own criterion. A named, recorded, but revoked or mismatched grant keeps the use blocked. | Prevents explicit records and green displays from substituting for current world-side or institutional conditions. |
| **CC-A15.4-5 (Register source is not the effect)** | A register-backed reliance keeps the register-entry episteme, its publication relation, constitutive rule, authorized entry-producing Work, actual exercised Work or evaluation Work when current, direct relation/finding, and evidence/currentness relation separate. The entry is authoritative source only for the exact claim or effect governed by the named rule. An institutional effect needs the authorized Work that the rule makes constitutive; exercise needs dated matching Work; a non-violation finding needs its owner-defined evaluation.

### A.15.4:5 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

- **Appearance as source relation.** A dashboard tile, credential display, copied approval, generated explanation, provenance label, command-like cue, or composed source-relation chain is used as if presentation itself carried the work-relevant source relation. First name the work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, or P2W chain position under repair, then recover the governing pattern and governing pattern position for the requested claim or effect. If that value is missing, lower only the unsupported reliance.

### A.15.4:6 - Consequences

| Consequence | Trade-off and cost | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Work can continue at the lightest relation-governed level instead of stopping on every suspicious display. | The practitioner names the claim being made and governing pattern position or project reference before relying on the appearance. | Use the ordinary local repair record first; use fuller fields only for high-impact or contested reliance. |
| Appearance-based approval, evidence, assurance, gate, and work-occurrence overreads are blocked. | Some convenient dashboard or copied-text shortcuts become unusable until source-currentness relation is recovered. | Keep orientation, source-finding, and bounded reversible probes available when no external-impact reliance is being made. |
| Repeated ambiguity becomes governing pattern or source-relation repair work rather than repeated manual heroics. | The repair may reveal missing register entries, stale `U.EpistemePublication` records that expose source relations, or underspecified gate and evidence relations. | Assign only prospective repair work or source-relation gap work; do not backdate evidence, gate passage, work occurrence, or assurance. |

### A.15.4:7 - Rationale

A.15.4 exists because work often first meets a source expression, source `U.Episteme`, source `U.EpistemePublication`, source-bearing relation, or composed source-relation chain through a display, publication face, generated explanation, copied statement, credential view, dashboard tile, schema wording, or API wording before the governing pattern position and project-side reference are visible. The pattern protects work momentum and recoverability together: it lets the practitioner use the reliance appearance for orientation or bounded source-finding, while preventing that appearance from becoming approval, evidence, assurance, gate passage, performed work, release authorization, role-assignment currentness, role-state currentness, or credential-status currentness by appearance.

The pattern is deliberately a local repair relation, not a new authority relation. Once the direct evidence, gate, assurance, role/state, work, publication, boundary, or permission/authority object selected in §3 is recovered, its direct pattern carries it.

### A.15.4:8 - SoTA-Echoing

**SoTA alignment rule.** Interpret each row here as source idea -> local FPF invariant -> practical local test -> popular shortcut rejected. A source citation governs nothing by reputation; it counts only when the cited idea is translated into the Solution, conformance checks, boundary rules, worked slices, and relations of this pattern.

| Claim need | Source idea and current named object | Current object or relation ref | Local FPF invariant and practical local test | Adopted invariant, adapted invariant, and rejected shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dynamic authorization or policy-response displays need requested operation named by value, affected resource or work target, context, and window relation. | Dynamic authorization practice separates subject, requested operation, affected resource or work target, context, and window before a relying use is allowed. | NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture; Cedar Policy Language Reference Guide v4.5; OpenFGA authorization-modeling docs; source maturity = current standards, specifications, and widely used technical practice. | The local repair record names the work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, or P2W chain position under repair, the affected resource or work target, affected claim when one is being made, policy version, context, and time window before treating a visible allow response, deny response, or policy response as a relation-governed source relation for work or reliance. | **Adopt, adapt, reject.** Adopt bounded currentness, source-relation, and relation-governed-use invariants; adapt them through FPF project records named by value; reject treating policy-looking output as permission or work-relevant source relation by display. |
| Register-backed credential-status or role-state needs source/effect separation. | Current identity practice separates register entry, publication, issuer/subject binding, constitutive rule, authorized update/evaluation Work, direct status relation or finding, verifier/relying context, revocation, and freshness. | W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0 Recommendation and current digital identity or register-backed status practice; source maturity = current specifications and technical practice. | Treat the entry as authoritative source only under the named rule for its exact effect; test the direct relation/finding and evidence/currentness separately. | **Adopt, adapt, reject.** Adopt register authority and currentness checks; reject entry/display presence as the status, Work, exercise, non-violation, gate passage, or permission/authority itself. |
| Provenance and attestation marks need source relation and process-trace relation without becoming truth, release, or work evidence. | Provenance and attestation practice separates origin relation, process traceability relation, build claim, supply-chain claim, and verification metadata from truth of downstream claims, release authorization, or deontic permission. | C2PA Specifications 2.4 content provenance and attestations; SLSA v1.2 provenance; in-toto Statement v1 attestations; source maturity = current standards, specifications, and widely used practice. | A provenance or attestation mark remains source relation or process-trace relation until `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `A.15.1`, or another source relation named by value carries the downstream claim. | **Adopt, adapt, reject.** Adopt source traceability and process traceability; reject provenance-mark-as-truth, release authorization, deontic permission, gate passage, assurance, or work occurrence. |
| Change, gate, release, and approval displays need decision, schedule, and performed-work separation. | Release and change practice separates approval/authorization acts, permission and authority objects, gate decisions, planned schedules, and performed work. | ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2023 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 life-cycle process separation; ITIL 4 Change Enablement and current release and change practice; source maturity = current life-cycle standards plus mature service-management practice. | An approval-looking display supports reliance only when it exposes the exact §3 branch object, `GateDecision`, `U.WorkPlan`, or dated `A.15.1` Work occurrence required by the attempted use, plus the evidence/currentness relation needed for reliance. | **Adopt, adapt, reject.** Adopt decision, permission/authority, schedule, and performed-work separation; reject a green tile, copied approval, or generated explanation as any of those by appearance. |

**Digital-identity and provenance boundary.** The cited identity, provenance, policy, and change sources supply currentness, credential-status, role-state, provenance, and change-practice checks. They do not turn a credential, provenance label, attestation, policy response, register excerpt, or dashboard display into work, gate passage, permission/authority, assurance, release, or another project relation. Recover the direct owner through §3 before relying.

The nearest recovery references are the worked dashboard case, the permission and authority branch in §3, `CC-A15.4-1`, `CC-A15.4-2`, and the direct evidence, assurance, gate, and work owners named in the governing-position lookup. If a SoTA row cannot be recovered through those local checks, do not let its citation stand in for the local `A.15.4` rule.

### A.15.4:9 - Relations

* **Cluster relation:** `A.15.4` is a cluster member under `A.15` for work-relevant appearance-based reliance repair; it does not replace the A.15 role, method, plan, and work kernel.
* **Uses:** `E.17`, `E.17:5.1b`, `E.17:5.1c`, and `E.17:5.1d` for source-relation/use-boundary vocabulary; `E.17.EFP` for explanation faithfulness/source-finding; `A.16.0` for source transfer; `A.6`, `A.6.B`, and `A.6.C` for boundary wording; `A.10` for evidence/currentness; `B.3` for assurance; `A.15.5` for work-entry readiness; `A.20` for constraint validity; `A.21` for gate decisions; `A.2.1` for role/state relations; `A.15.1` for dated Work; and `A.2.8`, `A.2.8.PER`, and `A.2.9` only through the single permission and authority branch in §3.
* **E.10 and E.10.MOVE relation-selection rule:** When source-relation, permission/authority, readiness, role/state, green-tile, generated/copy, provenance, dashboard, or move-like wording is being used as a reason for work or reliance, `E.10.MOVE` first repairs hidden work-entry/readiness wording and `E.10.ARCH` assigns the direct evidence, assurance, readiness, gate, constraint, boundary, role/state, work, publication, transfer, or explanation question. Permission/authority uses the single §3 branch. `A.15.4` starts only while the needed governing position is still hidden by the reliance appearance.
* **A.15 boundary relation:** use `A.15` directly when the remaining question under repair is role, method, plan, and work alignment rather than a reliance appearance being used as a reason for work or reliance.

### A.15.4:9.1 - C.29 mathematical-lens use relation

> If a mathematical lens appears in work-relevant appearance-based reliance repair, use `C.29` only to state why the lens helps expose or bound a reliance appearance such as generated wording, dashboard cue, copied phrase, publication form, MVPK face, publication carrier, rendering, `PublicationUnit`, or source-finding cue. `A.15.4` still governs the reliance appearance, governing pattern position named by value, return or reopen condition, reliance relation, and whether that appearance can guide work under a recovered relation. Method choice, plans, and performed work remain governed by `A.15` and `A.15.1` when those claims are being made; a `C.29` lens-use result does not turn a cue, rendering, or diagnostic phrase into source relation.

### A.15.4:9.2 - P2W Result-Related Source Boundary

When a P2W use under `E.18.1` produces result wording, use this pattern only when a reliance appearance such as publication, dashboard, generated explanation, copied statement, provenance mark, schema wording, API wording, or composed source-relation chain is about to justify result-related work or reliance by appearance. No generic `WorkResult` kind is admitted.

Recover the governing pattern position and project-side reference before relying on any result-related cue: result artifact, resource ledger, launch-values-bound record, substitution record, telemetry, acceptance record, quality-evaluation record, done-state update, feedback pin, result measurement, evidence relation, assurance claim, parity relation, refresh relation, or role-assignment enactability claim. If the governing pattern or relation is missing, use the reliance appearance only for orientation or source-finding and block only the unsupported result-related work or reliance.

### A.15.4:9.3 - Lowering, Repair, and Refresh Conditions

Lower an `A.15.4` use when the attempted work or reliance claim, governing pattern position, relying context/window, or one required evidence, gate, assurance, role/state, work, publication, boundary, or permission/authority object selected in §3 cannot be recovered. The lowered use is orientation, source-finding, contested use, bounded reversible probe, repair request, or blocked unsupported claim.

Repair the local `A.15.4` record when its appearance, source currentness, revocation, source order, dashboard/credential publication, copied/generated source relation, boundary wording, or work-result cue changes. Repair the recovered value through its direct evidence, assurance, gate, constraint, role/state, work, publication, boundary, or §3 permission/authority owner; A.15.4 does not absorb that owner's repair.

Refresh before allowing the reliance appearance to guide release, safety, compliance, delegated role-assignment or role-state, contested source relation, cross-context reuse, work-result reliance, external-impact reliance, or irreversible work. Stop the refresh at the smallest changed governing pattern value or source relation: reliance appearance, source `U.Episteme` for the current claim, `U.EpistemePublication` exposing the claim-bound source relation, governing pattern position, source-currentness relation, role-state record, credential-status record, context-state record, revocation record, gate relation, evidence relation, assurance relation, copied-source relation, generated-source relation, or work-governed relation.
