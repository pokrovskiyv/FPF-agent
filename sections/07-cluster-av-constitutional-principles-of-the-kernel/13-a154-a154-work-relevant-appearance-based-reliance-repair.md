## A.15.4 - Work-Relevant Appearance-Based Reliance Repair

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**At a glance.** Use `A.15.4` when work or reliance is about to proceed from a dashboard tile, credential-status view, copied approval, generated explanation, provenance mark, API response, publication face, source-finding pointer, or weak indication, but the FPF position that would actually carry the required claim has not yet been named. That position is not another generic item: it is a governing pattern position such as a slot, relation record, gate decision, evidence or currentness relation, speech-act ref, commitment ref, role-state or credential-status relation, `U.WorkPlan`, or dated `U.Work` occurrence. First decide which working moment is live: preserve an early cue, plan intended work, rely on a claim that work or a decision already happened, or use an operative relation now. Then write the local repair record with the reliance appearance, its actual kind, the work or reliance use being justified, the required claim or instituted effect before use, the FPF pattern and concrete claim/effect-carrying position, the project-side claim/effect reference, the allowed use now, and the appearance overread being blocked. The record does not make dashboards, copied approvals, generated explanations, credentials, publications, pointers, or weak indications one kind.

**Use this when.** Use this pattern when the acting user is ready to plan, start, continue, stop, or rely because a dashboard, credential view, copied text, generated explanation, publication face, API response, or similar publication/display/credential/source-finding case looks approved, current, safe, evidenced, delegated, released, or ready, but the work still needs a concrete governing position and project-side reference named by value. Typical recovered positions are gate decisions, evidence or currentness relations, role-assignment refs, role-state or credential-status records, speech-act refs, commitment refs, `U.WorkPlan`, and dated work occurrences; the local fields `ClaimOrEffectPositionKind`, `ClaimOrEffectPositionRef`, `ClaimOrEffectPatternRef`, and `ProjectSideClaimOrEffectRef` state which FPF position is current.

**First output.** One compact `A.15.4` local repair record:

  AllowedUseNow:

```

**First repair use in practice.** Name what the encountered display, publication face, copied text, credential view, API response, pointer, or indication may safely do now: keep attention oriented, help find the concrete governing record or relation - gate, evidence/currentness, speech act, commitment, role-state, credential-status, plan, or dated work occurrence - preserve a weak indication through `A.16.1`, support planning only through a `U.WorkPlan`, proceed inside a recovered relation, or block only the unsupported work or reliance claim.

**What goes wrong if missed.** The reliance appearance starts acting as if it already proves approval, gate passage, evidence, assurance, performed work, currentness, or release authorization. Work then proceeds or stops while the governing pattern position that should carry the claim is missing, stale, revoked, or contradicted.

**Primary EntityOfConcern in plain terms.** One local repair relation for one claim that is being used to guide intended work or reliance. This field names the current branch of the repair problem, not one new umbrella kind. The relation connects the reliance appearance, the work or reliance use being justified, the concrete FPF position that must carry the required claim or instituted effect before use, the project-side claim or effect reference, the safe current use, and the blocked appearance overread.

**First repair checks.**
1. Name the reliance appearance's actual kind and publication position without treating its appearance as the governing pattern position or source relation itself.
2. Decide the live working moment: early attention to preserve, intended work to plan, reliance on already-performed work or a decision, or another operative relation for action now.
3. Fill `WorkOrRelianceUseKind` and `WorkOrRelianceUseRef`: the use being justified can be intended work, reliance on a claim, reliance on a performed-work occurrence, a work-relevant P2W claim, or a P2W chain position.
4. Name `RequiredClaimBeforeUseRef` when the governing pattern must carry a claim before the work or reliance use is admissible.
5. Name `RequiredInstitutedEffectBeforeUseRef` when the governing pattern must carry an effect, such as a gate passage, role-state change, commitment, or speech-act effect. Leave it empty when no instituted effect is being relied on.
6. Fill `ClaimOrEffectPatternRef`, `ClaimOrEffectPositionKind`, and `ClaimOrEffectPositionRef`: the position kind is one of the already-governed positions such as slot, relation record, project reference, source-currentness relation, gate decision, evidence relation, speech-act ref, commitment ref, or work-occurrence ref.
7. Fill `ProjectSideClaimOrEffectRef` with the project-side reference that must be named by value for the work or reliance use.
8. Choose the lightest relation-governed disposition now: proceed inside the recovered relation, narrow the recovered use, preserve a cue pack, run a bounded reversible probe under `U.WorkPlan`, return to the source-currentness or governing pattern when freshness is the live claim, ask the holder, work-performing system, or project role holder identified by the relevant `RoleAssignmentRef` to expose or repair the missing position, or block only the unsupported claim or effect.

**Not this pattern when.** Stay in A.15 when the question under repair is only `U.Role`, holder, context, `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.WorkPlan`, and `U.Work` separation. Stay in `A.15.2` for WorkPlan construction, `A.15.3` for planned slot-filling baselines, and `A.15.5` when the question is full-kit condition or work-entry readiness rather than a reliance appearance being used as a reason for work or reliance. Stay in `A.16.1` and `C.2.4` when the honest current value is pre-articulation cue preservation and articulation level. Stay in `C.16.Q` when dynamic-quality or evaluative wording is the current claim. Stay in `A.6.A` when the current claim is action invitation. Stay in E.17 when the question under repair is only publication-face exposure or multi-view publication. Stay in A.10, B.3, A.20, A.21, A.2.8, A.2.9, A.6, or A.15.1 when evidence, currentness, engineering justification, gate-passage claim, `ConstraintValidity` status, commitment, speech act, boundary claim, or work occurrence already governs the current use directly.

**What this buys.** The acting engineer-manager can keep work moving without trusting appearances: use the reliance appearance for orientation or source-finding when that is all it can carry, proceed only inside the recovered relation when that relation exists, and turn repeated ambiguity into source-relation repair work rather than repeated manual reconstruction.

### A.15.4:1 - Problem Frame

Dashboards, credential views, generated explanations, copied approvals, provenance labels, green tiles, schema wording, API wording, and composed source-relation chains often look ready for work or reliance before the record or relation that carries the claim is visible. The practical problem is to decide what an engineer-manager may do now without turning appearance into approval, gate passage, evidence, assurance, performed work, role-assignment currentness, role-state or credential-status currentness, or release authorization.

**Plain recognition line.** Let the dashboard tile, credential view, copied approval, generated explanation, publication face, API response, or pointer lead to the governing pattern position that must be checked. Do not let the reliance appearance become the relation, slot filler, or project-side reference that authorizes work or reliance.

**Reliance-appearance and claim/effect-position discipline.** In this pattern, `source` is not a generic kind. The governing value for the work or reliance use is the concrete slot, direct relation record, decision record, state/status/currentness record, work plan, work occurrence, or project-side reference that carries the required claim or instituted effect before use. Source-finding pointers, publication faces, publication carriers, renderings, dashboards, copied wording, generated explanations, and weak indications remain reliance appearances unless they expose that governing position, relation, or project-side reference. If no governing pattern position can be named, keep the reliance appearance at orientation, source-finding, cue-pack preservation, repair request, or bounded-probe use.

**Ontological unpacking of the local repair relation.** `A.15.4` does not introduce `U.Source`, `U.RequiredValue`, `WorkReliancePremise`, a generic cue head, or a generic visible-thing kind. It governs one dependent repair relation among already-governed values:
- `RelianceAppearanceRef` names the dashboard tile, credential view, copied wording, generated explanation, publication face, carrier, display, API wording, source-finding pointer, or low-articulation indication whose appearance is tempting the work or reliance use. Its actual kind is named separately in `RelianceAppearanceKind`, so the record can distinguish an episteme, episteme publication, publication face, carrier, display, copied wording, generated explanation, API wording, source-finding pointer, or low-articulation indication without making them one kind. If the live value is a preserve-worthy early cue, use `U.PreArticulationCuePack` under `A.16.1`.
- `WorkOrRelianceUseKind` and `WorkOrRelianceUseRef` name the use being justified: intended work, reliance on a claim, reliance on performed work, a work-relevant P2W claim, or a P2W chain position. These fields select the current branch; they do not create a durable kind.
- `RequiredClaimBeforeUseRef` is filled when the governing pattern must carry a claim before the work or reliance use is admissible.
- `RequiredInstitutedEffectBeforeUseRef` is filled when the governing pattern must carry an effect before the work or reliance use is admissible, such as a gate passage, role-state change, commitment, or speech-act effect.
- `ClaimOrEffectPatternRef`, `ClaimOrEffectPositionKind`, `ClaimOrEffectPositionRef`, and `ProjectSideClaimOrEffectRef` name the direct FPF pattern, the position kind in that pattern, the exact position or relation to inspect, and the project-side reference required by that pattern.
- `AllowedUseNow` states what use remains admissible after repair, such as orientation, source-finding, bounded reversible probe, narrowed reliance, or proceed-inside-recovered-relation.
- `AppearanceOverreadBlocked` names the false use that the reliance appearance would create by appearance, for example treating a dashboard color as gate passage or a copied approval as a current speech act.
- `RecoveryOrStopCondition` names what blocks the work or reliance use and what newly exposed or repaired governing pattern value would reopen it.

Here `evidence relation`, `attestation relation`, and `currentness relation` mean `A.10` evidence-provenance, attestation, or currentness relations named by value. They are not work-procedure elements and do not carry authorization by their wording.

### A.15.4:2 - Problem - Cluster Boundary

A.15 remains the kernel for separating `U.Role`, holder and context, `U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.WorkPlan`, and dated `U.Work`. A.15.4 starts only when a reliance appearance begins to justify a work claim or reliance claim and the team needs to recover the governing pattern position and project-side reference that carry that claim or effect. If the governing pattern and project-side reference are already known, use them directly and keep A.15.4 as the bounded repair relation.

### A.15.4:2.1 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Work momentum vs. governing-position recoverability | Teams need to keep work moving, but a reliance appearance can make the wrong claim look like work authorization when the governing pattern position is still unnamed. |
| Cheap first note vs. high-impact reliance | Routine source-finding should stay light, while release, safety, compliance, role-assignment, credential-status, role-state, and gate cases need more fields. |
| Publication face vs. governing pattern value | The visible carrier may be useful for orientation, but the work or reliance claim belongs to the project-side FPF kind and reference named by value. |
| Neighboring governed claims vs. local repair | A.15.4 can recover the missing governing pattern position for the attempted work or reliance use, but evidence, gate, assurance, speech-act, commitment, boundary, credential-status, role-state, and work-occurrence claims must return to their governing patterns. |
| Repeated ambiguity vs. individual burden | Repeated ambiguity about the required claim, instituted effect, or governing position should become governing-position or source-relation repair work, not repeated manual reconstruction by every acting practitioner. |

### A.15.4:3 - Solution - Work-Relevant Appearance-Based Reliance Repair

#### Core stress-case rule

**Ordinary local repair record.** In ordinary use, do not build a full evidence, currentness, or provenance dossier. The first useful record is:

`RelianceAppearanceRef; RelianceAppearanceKind; WorkOrRelianceUseKind; WorkOrRelianceUseRef; RequiredClaimBeforeUseRef; RequiredInstitutedEffectBeforeUseRef; ClaimOrEffectPatternRef; ClaimOrEffectPositionKind; ClaimOrEffectPositionRef; ProjectSideClaimOrEffectRef; AllowedUseNow; AppearanceOverreadBlocked; RecoveryOrStopCondition`

The reliance appearance may be a tile, credential view, approval-looking memo, generated explanation, copied review, provenance mark, API wording, functional-description publication, or composed source-relation chain. The pattern asks whether the work or reliance use is currently carried by a claim/effect position and project-side reference named by value, not whether the reliance appearance is impressive, fluent, easy to inspect, or visually salient.

**Conditional governing pattern and position field set.** Use the fuller fields below only when `RequiredClaimBeforeUseRef` or `RequiredInstitutedEffectBeforeUseRef` falls in release, safety, compliance, role-assignment relation, credential-status, role-state, gate, assurance, contested source relation, external reliance, cross-context reuse, currentness, revocation, generated source relation, or copied source relation. These fields are local repair aids, not a new record kind.

| Field | Working question |
| --- | --- |
| subject or actor | Who or what would perform the work, rely on the appearance, hold the credential-status or role-state, or be affected by the claim? |
| role-assignment claim | Which `U.RoleAssignment` or role-context claim is being made? |
| intended work or work target | Is the user planning intended work, relying on a dated `U.Work` occurrence or result, or making another reliance claim? Name that branch and the governing pattern before the reliance appearance guides it. |
| affected resource or claim | Which resource, claim, gate, credential, credential-status, role-state, evidence, approval, or source-finding pointer with authority-reference relation is supposedly affected? |
| context | Which bounded context, environment, project slice, API setting, connector setting, protocol setting, or relying situation makes the claim applicable? |
| policy or gate version | Which policy, gate profile, constraint version, method version, or register edition is supposed to govern the claim? |
| time window | During which window is the claim, effect, source relation, or recovered-use boundary claimed to hold? |
| currentness or revocation field | Is the source relation current, stale, revoked, superseded, expired, contradicted, or unknown? |
| issuer or governing reference | Which issuer, project reference, register entry, source-currentness or credential-status record, speech act, gate decision, evidence relation, or work-occurrence record is required by the governing pattern for the current use? |
| verifier or relying context | Who is checking or relying on the claim, and in which context? |
| evidence or attestation relation | Which `A.10` evidence, provenance, or attestation relation, if any, justifies the claim without itself becoming approval, gate passage, assurance, or work occurrence? |
| sourceRelationClass | Which `E.17:5.1b` source-relation class or claim-use class applies to the reliance appearance and required claim or use? |
| unsupported effect | Which requested work claim, reliance claim, governing value, or downstream effect remains unsupported and needs narrowing, repair, reopening, probing, or blocking? |

Start with the A.15.4 first repair checks above when the reliance appearance is being used as a reason for intended work, reliance, or a work-relevant claim. If the issue under repair is only evidence, currentness, gate-passage claim, `ConstraintValidity` status, engineering justification, commitment, speech act, boundary wording, use-boundary wording, credential proof, source-currentness proof, credential-status proof, explanation, comparison, or publication-carrier or front-end behavior, use the pattern governing that issue directly. Use A.15.4 only when the governing pattern position and project-side reference must be recovered before role assignment, method, plan, work, work result, result measurement, or another work or reliance claim can proceed.

**When a reliance appearance seems to authorize work or reliance.** Use A.15.4 when a publication, display, credential view, wording, or explanation looks like permission, prohibition, readiness, or evidence for intended work or reliance. This is a recognition moment, not a new kind. The repair question remains: what does the user intend to do next, what claim or effect would make that intended work or reliance admissible, and which governing pattern position and project-side reference are required for it?

Here "authority-looking case" is only a recognition phrase for the encountered situation. The record, relation, slot filler, or project-side reference that authorizes, forbids, records, or carries the required relation is named by value under its FPF pattern. Use `E.17:5.1c` for the shared meanings of `orientation use`, `reliance use`, operative claim, unsupported downstream use, and `reopen trigger`; use `E.17:5.1d` when the primary question under repair belongs to another governing pattern.

The central behaviour is: name the work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, or P2W chain position under repair; name the governing pattern position and project-side reference that carry the required claim, effect, work occurrence, or currentness value; keep the `U.Episteme` or `U.EpistemePublication` distinct from publication form, MVPK face, publication carrier, rendering, and source-finding cue; choose the minimum sufficient recovered use; and do not raise the claim beyond the recovered relation, source relation, or recovered use boundary. If the named project record states the governing FPF relation, use that recorded relation directly rather than inferring it from wording.

**Positive repaired disposition.** An encountered `U.Episteme` publication, publication form, MVPK face, publication carrier, rendering, or source-finding cue may guide work or reliance only to the claim or effect carried by the recovered governing pattern position, acting holder, work-performing system, agent, `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned attribution is current, work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, P2W chain position under repair, affected work target, context, window, and project-side reference. The repaired outcome says what may happen next and which unsupported work claim or reliance claim stays blocked.

Reliance dispositions by recovered governing pattern relation:

| Work or reliance disposition | Use when | Minimum useful record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orientation or source-finding note | The reliance appearance is only a publication face, publication carrier, rendering, cue, retrieval cue, learning aid, or reversible local probe trigger. | `RelianceAppearanceRef; RelianceAppearanceKind; WorkOrRelianceUseKind; WorkOrRelianceUseRef; RequiredClaimBeforeUseRef or RequiredInstitutedEffectBeforeUseRef when current; ClaimOrEffectPatternRef; ClaimOrEffectPositionKind; ClaimOrEffectPositionRef; ProjectSideClaimOrEffectRef; AllowedUseNow; AppearanceOverreadBlocked; RecoveryOrStopCondition`. |
| Routine reliance note | The team needs ordinary bounded reliance without release, safety, compliance, delegated role-assignment claim, role-state claim, credential-status claim, contested source relation, or cross-context reuse. | Work or reliance use, required claim when current, instituted effect when current, acting holder, work-performing system, or agent; `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned authority or work attribution is current; affected work target, context, effective window; governing pattern position or project-side source relation exposed by the reliance appearance; and reopen trigger. |
| High-impact reliance disposition | The required claim or instituted effect is external-impact, irreversible, release-bearing, gate-bearing, compliance-bearing, safety-bearing, delegated, revoked, role-state-claim-bearing, credential-status-claim-bearing, generated-source-mediated, copied-source-mediated, provenance-mediated, contested, or cross-context. | Governing pattern and position field set with the `A.10`, `A.6`, `B.3`, `A.2.9`, `A.2.8`, `A.21`, `A.20`, or `A.15.1` fields required for that claim or effect. |

A small A.15.4 local repair record is enough for the first disposition:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `RelianceAppearanceRef` | Name the appearance being relied on by value, such as the dashboard tile, credential view, copied text, generated explanation, publication face, publication carrier, rendering, or source-finding cue. |
| `RelianceAppearanceKind` | Name the kind without granting authority by appearance: actual `U.Episteme`, actual `U.EpistemePublication`, publication form, MVPK face, publication carrier, rendering, `PublicationUnit`, dashboard tile, credential view, generated wording, copied wording, or source-finding cue. |
| `WorkOrRelianceUseKind` and `WorkOrRelianceUseRef` | Name the use being justified by value: intended work, reliance on a claim, reliance on a dated `U.Work` occurrence, method-family selection, selected method, method of work, work plan, planned work, work result, result measurement, release reliance decision, non-work reliance claim, work-relevant P2W claim, or P2W chain position. A planned baseline remains a `U.WorkPlan` or `U.WorkPlanning` plan record; performed work becomes `U.Work` only after it occurs and is recorded under `A.15.1`; work-result measurement belongs with the evidence relation or result-measurement record that carries it. |
| `RequiredClaimBeforeUseRef` | Fill when a claim must be carried by a governing pattern before the work or reliance use is admissible. Leave empty when the current reliance is only on an instituted effect. |
| `RequiredInstitutedEffectBeforeUseRef` | Fill when an effect must be carried by a governing pattern before the work or reliance use is admissible, such as approval act effect, gate passage, role-state change, credential-status effect, commitment, or speech-act effect. Leave empty when the current reliance is only on a claim. |
| `ClaimOrEffectPatternRef` | Name the direct FPF pattern that carries the required claim, required instituted effect, relation, slot filler, or source-currentness value. |
| `ClaimOrEffectPositionKind` and `ClaimOrEffectPositionRef` | Name the position kind explicitly, such as slot, relation record, project reference, source-currentness relation, gate decision, evidence relation, speech-act ref, commitment ref, role-assignment ref, role-state record, credential-status record, or work-occurrence ref. Then name the exact position or relation to inspect. |
| `ProjectSideClaimOrEffectRef` | Name the project-side FPF reference that must be current for the work or reliance use. |
| `AllowedUseNow` | State the safe current use: orientation, source-finding, cue-pack preservation, bounded reversible probe, narrowed reliance, governing-position repair request, proceed-inside-recovered-relation, or blocked unsupported use. |
| `AppearanceOverreadBlocked` | State the overread being blocked, such as treating display color as gate passage, copied approval as a current speech act, a credential screenshot as permission, or a generated explanation as evidence. |
| `RecoveryOrStopCondition` | State what blocks the work or reliance use and what would reopen it. |

**Borrowed episteme and publication discipline.** A.15.4 borrows the `C.2.1`, `E.17`, and `A.16.0` distinction rather than minting a new generic `U.*` kind. The claim-bearing FPF kind here is `U.Episteme`; `U.EpistemePublication` is used only when that episteme is available as a published episteme with MVPK-face references. Publication forms, MVPK faces, publication carriers, renderings, `PublicationUnit` instances, and source-finding cues are separate kinds or relation positions in the case. A planned baseline remains a `U.WorkPlan` or `U.WorkPlanning` plan record such as `SlotFillingsPlanItem`; launch values and finalization values remain their own project records, decision logs remain gate or decision records, performed-work evidence remains evidence, and dated work occurrences remain `A.15.1` or `U.Work` matters.

When the governing pattern position is incomplete, choose one relation-governed `A.15.4` disposition after naming the work or reliance use and the governing pattern position required for the required claim or instituted effect; pick the lightest disposition that preserves practical work and recoverability:

1. Use the reliance appearance only for orientation or source-finding.
2. Reopen the source `U.Episteme` for the current claim, the `U.EpistemePublication` that exposes the claim-bound source relation, register entry, governing record, or governing relation, or refresh source-currentness, credential-status, role-state, context-state, or another currentness relation.
3. Narrow the acting holder, work-performing system, agent, `RoleAssignmentRef` when current, requested operation or work class, affected work target, affected resource, affected claim, context, and effective window until the recovered record or relation really covers the recovered use.
4. Run a bounded reversible probe under an explicit `U.WorkPlan` when no external-impact reliance is being made.
5. Ask the holder, work-performing system, maintainer, verifier, issuer, or project role holder identified by the relevant `RoleAssignmentRef` or governing pattern relation to expose or repair the missing governing pattern position. `ClaimOrEffectPositionKind` may be a slot, record, or relation for the issuer, gate decision, evidence relation, role-assignment record, role-state record, credential-status record, context-state record, source-currentness relation, or boundary claim set.
6. Repair the `U.WorkPlan`, `U.MethodDescription`, dashboard label, source-relation link, or boundary wording that made the overread plausible.
7. Proceed only inside the recovered scope and window.
8. Block only the work claim or reliance claim that lacks the required relation.

#### Repair assignment rule

**Missing record or relation repair assignment.** If the required governing record or relation is unavailable to the acting user, assign only prospective repair work, request work, decision work, work-plan work, or source-relation gap work to the holder, work-performing system, maintainer, verifier, or project role holder identified by the relevant `RoleAssignmentRef` or governing pattern relation for the missing relation. The acting user records the blocked work claim or reliance claim, the missing relation, and the safe narrowed use now.

**Reliance-appearance kind check.** First name the actual kind of the reliance appearance: actual `U.Episteme`, actual `U.EpistemePublication`, publication form, MVPK face, publication carrier, rendering, `PublicationUnit`, dashboard tile, credential view, generated wording, copied wording, or source-finding cue. If the appearance exposes the governing record or relation, use that exposed value directly. If only the display face, publication carrier, wording, or cue is named, the A.15.4 disposition is orientation, source-finding, bounded reversible probe, repair request, or blocked unsupported reliance until the source relation named by value is recovered.

**Source-relation guard.** Release urgency, delegated-claim urgency, compliance concern, color, salience, copied wording, or generated wording does not replace the source relation named by value. A dashboard tile may guide release only as a current view of the relevant `GateDecision` plus evidence relation, currentness relation, scope, and window.

#### Governing-position lookup table

Governing patterns by required claim or effect kind:

- cue-only orientation: use only for attention, learning, source-finding, or a reversible local probe trigger; stay with `A.16`, `A.16.1`, or `A.6.A` when those claims are being made.
- issuing, approval, authorization, delegation, or revocation act: cite `A.2.9` `U.SpeechAct` or `SpeechActRef`, including act type, acting holder, work-performing system, or agent, `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned authority is claimed, affected work target or claim, judgement context, window, publication-carrier reference, evidence reference when currentness matters, and instituted effects if claimed. Because `U.SpeechAct <: U.Work`, it can evidence only that communicative act.
- deontic permission, obligation, prohibition, or recommendation-as-duty: cite `A.2.8` `U.Commitment` and the instituting `SpeechActRef` when provenance matters. If the word instead names claimed use boundary, gate passage, authorization act, role-assignment effect, role-state effect, credential-status effect, cue, or advice, use the pattern that carries that kind named by value.
- role-assignment, role-state, credential-status, or context-state reliance: cite `A.2.1`, `U.RoleAssignment`, a state-changing `U.SpeechAct`, a governing context-state record, a credential proof or credential-status result under `A.10`, or an `A.21` `GateDecision` when the state is gate-governed.
- boundary, policy, API, schema, "allowed", "authorized", "approved", "recommended", or "guaranteed" wording: split the statement through `A.6` or `A.6.B`; use `A.6.C`, `A.2.3`, `A.2.8`, and `A.2.9` for agreement-like guarantee, SLA, or promise wording before intended work or reliance.
- gate decision or gate passage: cite `A.21` `OperationalGate(profile)`, `GateDecision`, `GateDecisionRationale`, `DecisionLogRef`, gate profile, gate version, check set, scope, window, and replay or freshness pins.
- Flow constraint-validity witness: cite `A.20` `ConstraintValidity` status, witness, `GateCheckRef.aspect = ConstraintValidity`, `PathId` or `PathSliceId` when applicable, window, sentinel, and pins when those fields are needed for the claim.
- release, deployment, repair, inspection, or rollback work occurrence: cite `A.15.1` dated `U.Work` occurrence and the `A.10` evidence or provenance relation when reliance on occurrence is needed.
- evidence, provenance, authenticity, currentness, copied-source, or generated-source relation: apply `A.10` and name the claim-bound evidence relation, currentness relation, and relation-governed or blocked use.
- assurance, safety, compliance, trust, release confidence, or `R`, `F`, `G`, or `CL` increase: apply `B.3` and name the typed assurance claim plus its limitations and reopen condition. If the word `ready` names full-kit or work-entry readiness, use `A.15.5`; if it names a gate decision, use `A.21`.
- generated explanation: use `E.17.EFP` for explanation faithfulness or source-finding relation, then require `A.10` claim-bound source relation for every operative claim that will be relied on.
- ambiguous approval, permission, or authorization wording: choose among the rows above named by value by asking what effect is claimed now: speech act, commitment, claimed use boundary, gate passage, role-assignment effect, role-state change, credential-status change, evidence relation, assurance claim, or work occurrence.

| `A.2.8` | `U.Commitment` deontic relation with accountable holder, work-performing system, or agent, `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned accountability is claimed, referents, modality, scope, effective window, and instituting `SpeechActRef` or source relation when needed. | Use for deontic permission, obligation, prohibition, or recommendation-as-duty. |
| `A.15.1` | Dated `U.Work` occurrence plus `A.10` evidence or provenance relation when relied on. | Use for reliance on performed work. |
| `E.17.EFP` | Explanation class, source-finding relation, and faithfulness relation over the source `U.Episteme` or the `U.EpistemePublication` exposing that source relation. | Use for generated-explanation faithfulness and source-finding before operative reliance. |

High-impact work or reliance - especially external-impact, irreversible, release-bearing, role-assignment-bearing, role-state-claim-bearing, credential-status-claim-bearing, gate-bearing, compliance-bearing, safety-bearing, delegated, contested, or assurance-bearing claim or effect - may guide work only for the acting holder, work-performing system, or agent, the `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned capacity or attribution is current, the work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, P2W chain position under repair, affected work target or claim, audience, scope, environment, version, policy context, operational mode, and time window for which the required FPF-governed project-side source relation, evidence relation, gate decision, or assurance claim is recoverable. Cue-only, source-finding, learning, and bounded reversible probes stay lightweight and do not require a full evidence, currentness, or provenance dossier.
Quick dispositions:

| Encountered case | First `A.15.4` disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Release dashboard tile exposing a source relation | If the tile is a current dashboard view of `A.21` `GateDecision` or `DecisionLogRef` plus release scope or work target, environment, scope, window, gate profile, gate version, and `A.10` evidence relation, it may carry gate-passage reliance for that release and environment. |
| Release dashboard tile without current gate or evidence relation | Use the tile only for display or source-finding until the current `A.21` `GateDecision` or `DecisionLogRef`, release scope or work target, environment or scope, time window, gate profile, gate version, and `A.10` evidence relation are recoverable. Open `B.3` only when an assurance claim is being made. |
| Copied review summary or copied approval | Copied wording and copied-currentness cue at most; approval, authorization, deontic permission, commitment, or work occurrence needs the original `A.2.9` `SpeechActRef`, `A.21` decision, `A.2.8` commitment, or dated `A.15.1` work occurrence plus `A.10` evidence or provenance relation. |
| Delegation chain with forwarded approval | Each link names delegator, delegatee, delegated operation or work class, affected work target, affected resource, affected claim, scope, window, the delegation record or relation permitting delegation, subdelegation allowance if any, revocation relation, currentness relation, and evidence relation. A forwarded approval is not delegated authority by copy alone. |
| Role-assignment, revocation, role-state, or credential-status display | Resolve to role assignment, state-changing speech act, context-state record, credential proof or credential-status result, or gate decision with freshness field, revocation relation, or revocation record; visual display cannot defeat a higher-priority revocation or supersession relation. |
| Conflicting source relations | Do not resolve by color, visual salience, copied wording, or apparent recency. Name source-relation order, governing decision record, freshness policy, and supersession rule; the work claim, reliance claim, or effect is contested until resolved, while source-finding and bounded reversible probes remain available. |
| Credential badge or register-backed credential-status view | Use the display as a publication of a credential record, credential-status record, or role-state record, not the record or relation itself. Find the governing credential-status register, role-state register, or issuer, trust root, holder binding or subject binding, verifier context, relying context, proof or credential-status result, revocation, freshness, and effective window. If the governing register entry itself creates or changes role assignment, role-state, deontic permission, duty, or gate effect in the bounded context, cite that register or status record named by value and the `A.2.1`, `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, `A.6.B`, or `A.21` governing relation it depends on. Otherwise rely only on credential-currentness for that holder and context. |
| Rollback command-like cue | Treat as cue or `A.6.A`-governed invitation unless command record, authorization, work occurrence, performed-work result, or gate decision is recoverable. |
| Generated explanation says "authorized" | Explanation may help find source `U.EpistemePublication` refs, claim-bound source relations, or governing pattern positions; it does not issue, approve, revoke, commit, authorize, pass a gate, provide evidence for performed work, or raise assurance. A citation or source mention inside the explanation guides intended work or reliance only when the cited publication carrier carries that relied-on claim named by value in the relying context under `A.10`. |
| Extracted source publication, rewrite, representation shift, explanation, then gate or release claim | Return to the source `U.EpistemePublication`, source-bearing relation, transform record, evidence relation, explanation relation, or governing pattern position at the first lossy or non-commutative transformation operation; the gate claim or release claim waits for the required transform record, evidence relation, explanation relation, gate decision, or assurance claim. |
| Repeated green-tile failures without recoverable source relation | Treat recurrence as upstream source-relation repair work: expose decision refs, fix dashboard semantics, add claim-bound source relations and currentness, revise boundary wording, or add review cues so the acting user is not repeatedly forced to reconstruct missing source relation. |

### A.15.4:3.1 - Archetypal Grounding - Worked Dashboard And Approval Examples

Worked dashboard and approval slice:

A release dashboard shows a green approval-looking tile for `Release-2026.05.08-prod`. If the tile is a current view of the relevant `GateDecisionRef` plus evidence relation and currentness relation, it may carry bounded gate-passage reliance for that release scope and window. A claim that deployment happened still requires a dated `A.15.1` work occurrence plus the evidence or provenance relation needed for the relying context. If the gate reference is missing or stale, treat the tile as orientation and source-finding until the team can name the release-work claim under repair, release-work position under repair, governing pattern for the claim or effect, and governing-position fields for the gate decision, evidence relation, and currentness relation.

| Step | Required record or relation |
| --- | --- |
| Required project claim or effect kind | Release reliance, gate passage, compliance proof, assurance increase, evidence relation, or currentness relation. |
| Gate decision record | Cite the current `A.21` `GateDecision` or `DecisionLogRef`, gate profile, gate version, release scope or work target, scope, window, and replay or freshness pins. Without that record, the tile is not release authorization or gate passage. |
| Flow constraint-validity witness | Cite `A.20` `ConstraintValidity` status or witness only when the claim is about flow constraint validity, not about the gate decision itself. |
| Evidence and currentness relation | Use `A.10` for the dashboard query, publication-carrier integrity, evidence refs, time, window, freshness field, revocation relation or revocation record, verifier context, relying context, and rival explanation such as stale display or copied status. |
| Assurance claim | Use `B.3` only if the tile is being used to raise readiness, compliance, trust, safety, release confidence, `R`, `F`, `G`, or `CL`; otherwise no assurance tuple is being claimed. |
| Repaired gate-use reliance | With the decision and evidence relation recovered, rely on gate passage only for the named release scope or work target, environment, gate profile, gate version, time, and window; a claim that deployment happened still needs a dated `A.15.1` work occurrence plus the evidence or provenance relation needed for the relying context. |
| Blocked overreads | The dashboard color does not create approval, deontic permission, compliance proof, rollback success, work occurrence, or assurance by display. |

Approval memo green-tile case:

An approval memo may carry an approval claim when it exposes the `A.2.9` `SpeechActRef`, acting holder, work-performing system, or agent, `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned authority is claimed, affected release scope or work target, judgement context, time, window, publication-carrier refs, evidence refs, and instituted effect being claimed. That carries only the bounded approval use governed by `A.2.9`. It does not prove that release, deployment, rollback, or other work occurred; that performed-work claim still needs the dated `A.15.1` work occurrence plus any `A.10` evidence relation required for the relying context.

Credential-status and role-state green-tile case:

A credential, credential-status, or role-state response may carry holder reliance, credential-status reliance, role-state reliance, or currentness reliance only inside the issuer, governing credential-status register, governing role-state register, holder binding or subject binding, verifier context, relying context, proof result or credential-status result, revocation relation or revocation record, freshness field, and effective window that it exposes. It does not by itself carry release, work occurrence, gate passage, engineering justification, evidence for underlying operational facts, contextual deontic permission, or authorization; those uses require their own governing patterns and project-side references.

Situation viewpoint prompts:

| Viewpoint or repair concern | Prompt |
| --- | --- |
| Acting practitioner | What can I safely do next without turning the encountered episteme or episteme publication into unsupported work or reliance justification? |
| Release engineer | Which `A.21` gate decision, decision log, release scope, work target, and `A.15.1` work occurrence are separate here? |
| Issuer, gate, evidence, or role-assignment steward | Which source-currentness value, role-state value, credential-status value, decision ref, or evidence relation needs exposure or repair? |
| Audit or peer-review viewpoint | Which evidence relation, decision ref, speech-act ref, commitment, work occurrence, or assurance claim needs recoverability? |
| Boundary claimant | Which words need typed claim IDs before they can guide work or reliance? |
| Manager | Is repeated ambiguity governing-position repair work rather than another manual check for the acting practitioner? |
| LLM user or tool user | Which governing pattern position or source relation does the explanation help find, and which operative claims still need an `A.10` claim-bound source relation? |
| Security or compliance steward | Which revocation relation, currentness relation, proof, credential-status record, role-state record, source-relation order, or supersession relation needs exposure? |
| Model or data documentation steward | Which intended use, evaluation condition, version, window, limitation, and evidence relation bound the model or data documentation? |
| Assurance viewpoint | Which named claim actually has a `B.3` assurance claim, with what assurance tuple, evidence relation, limitations, and reopen condition? |

Search cues for A.15.4 include: approval, approval-looking display, authorization, authorization-looking display, permission, permission display, allowed wording, green dashboard, release tile, release readiness, model card, datasheet, data card, provenance, provenance mark, attestation, attestation label, credential, credential badge, generated explanation, copied review, copied approval, review summary, compliance-looking mark, delegation, delegation display, revocation, revocation status, gate passed, gate passage, rollback successful, rollback cue, and assurance label. These are retrieval cues only; decide the governing pattern position, governing pattern, and project-side reference from the work or reliance question under repair, not from the displayed word, publication-carrier name, or source name.

Work and reliance disposition table for authority-looking cases:

| Question under repair | Start in | First useful output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can this episteme publication, publication face, publication carrier, rendering, or cue guide work or reliance by appearance? | `A.15.4` | Work or reliance use, claim/effect position, project-side claim/effect reference, and minimum relation-governed use. |
| Is the problem boundary, policy, API, schema, or connector wording? | `A.6` or `A.6.B` | Typed `L-*`, `A-*`, `D-*`, and `E-*` claims before the work claim or reliance claim is used. |
| Is the problem evidence, currentness, provenance, credential-status, generated-source relation, copied-source relation, or source-chain recovery? | `A.10` | Claim-bound evidence relation, currentness relation, and relation-governed or blocked use. |
| Is the problem assurance, readiness, safety, compliance, trust, release confidence, or change in `R`, `F`, `G`, or `CL`? | `B.3` | Typed assurance claim, no-assurance-use disposition, or downgraded or rejected assurance use. |

Display guidance for bounded credential-status or role-state: a visible state label meant to guide work should expose source type, reference or link named by value, freshness, window, scope, unsupported work claim, unsupported reliance claim, and unsupported effect. For example, prefer `Gate check passed; GateDecisionRef; release scope; environment; window; not compliance proof, rollback success, or assurance increase` over a bare approval-looking label.

Incident-learning fields for authority-looking overread: encountered episteme or episteme publication, work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, or P2W chain position under repair, governing pattern and governing pattern position for the claim or effect, acting holder, work-performing system, or agent, `RoleAssignmentRef` when role-conditioned capacity or attribution is current, affected work target or claim, context, window, missing or stale source `U.Episteme` for the current claim, `U.EpistemePublication` exposing the claim-bound source relation, register entry, or project-side reference; governing FPF relation and, when role-conditioned repair responsibility is current, the `RoleAssignmentRef` identifying the holder or project role holder responsible for exposing or repairing that missing value, plausible overread, safe disposition used now, and upstream repair work for the source `U.Episteme`, dashboard, explanation, credential view, boundary wording, publication face, or publication carrier.

Contestability and redress relation: when an authority-looking case affects person or team role-state, credential-status, access, assignment, responsibility, release blockage, compliance claim, or safety-impacting work, name the review relation or redress relation before the work claim or reliance claim hardens. The relation should name the disputed source relation or claim, the holder, maintainer, verifier, or project role holder identified by the relevant `RoleAssignmentRef` for refreshing or correcting that relation or record, the evidence relation or state-currentness relation to reopen, the safe interim disposition, and the time and window for review.

Lintable overread cues:

| Lint signal | Governing relation named by value |
| --- | --- |
| `approved`, `authorized`, `allowed`, `recommended`, or `guaranteed` in boundary, API, schema, or policy wording | Split through `A.6` or `A.6.B` into `L-*`, `A-*`, `D-*`, and `E-*`; use `A.6.C`, `A.2.8`, and `A.2.9` for agreement-like wording when agreement, commitment, or speech-act claims are being made. |
| Dashboard tile, credential-status color, role-state color, or release tile used as release evidence or gate passage | Require `A.21` `GateDecision` or `DecisionLogRef` plus `A.10` evidence relation and currentness relation. |
| Credential screenshot or badge used as deontic permission, authorization, role-assignment relation, role-state relation, or credential-status relation | Require `A.10` issuer, holder, verifier, credential-status, currentness, and relying-context fields, then the `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, `A.2.1`, `A.6.B`, or `A.21` governing record or relation named by value for the required deontic permission, authorization, role assignment, role-state, credential-status, gate claim, or gate effect. |
| Generated explanation uses `authorized`, `approved`, or similar wording | Use `E.17.EFP` for explanation relation and source-finding relation and `A.10` claim-bound source relation; issue, approval, gate, and commitment claims still need `A.2.9`, `A.21`, or `A.2.8`. |
| Model card, datasheet, label, or note cited as readiness, safety, compliance, or release confidence | Require a typed `B.3` assurance claim, intended-use match, evaluation condition, limitations, and `A.10` evidence relation. Use `A.15.5` instead when the current claim is full-kit or work-entry readiness. |
| Provenance or attestation label cited as truth, safety, release, deontic permission, or authorization | Require `A.10` bounded provenance claim or process-trace claim plus separate evidence for truth, safety, release, deontic permission, authorization, or assurance. |
| Evidence, assurance, gate, or work-occurrence words without the governing pattern value that carries that claim or effect | Recover the `A.10` evidence relation, `B.3` assurance claim, `A.21` gate decision, or `A.15.1` work-occurrence record respectively before the work claim or reliance claim is used. |

Stress cases for practice:

| Case | Expected A.15.4 disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Green release dashboard tile with no `GateDecisionRef`. | Source-finding only; recover `A.21` decision or decision log plus `A.10` evidence before gate-passage reliance. |
| Copied approval from last month. | Recover original `A.2.9` `SpeechActRef`, currentness, freshness, and any `A.2.8` commitment or `A.21` gate decision record needed for the claim. |
| Credential badge screenshot after revocation. | Treat as contested credential-currentness; use `A.10` issuer, holder, verifier, credential-status, and revocation relation and do not infer deontic permission or authorization. |
| Generated explanation says `authorized by policy`. | Use `E.17.EFP` for explanation and source-finding and `A.10` claim-bound source relation; issuing, gate, and commitment claims still need the relevant `A.2.9` issuing act, `A.21` gate decision, or `A.2.8` commitment relation named by value. |
| Boundary wording says `guaranteed approved for production`. | Split through `A.6` or `A.6.B`; if agreement-like or promise-bearing, unpack through `A.6.C`, `A.2.8`, and `A.2.9`. |
| Dashboard says green while decision log says blocked. | Treat as conflicting source relations; name source-relation order, governing decision record, freshness policy, and supersession rule before the work claim or reliance claim is used. |
| CRISPR lab dashboard says the guide edit is ready. | Treat the dashboard as orientation or source-finding until the protocol publication or protocol record, approval record or gate record, role-assignment record, evidence relation, current lab context record, and `U.WorkPlan` for the intended edit are recoverable. If the question is full-kit or work-entry readiness for the intended edit, use `A.15.5`; the readiness tile still does not create biological-intervention authorization, deontic permission, safety, or performed work. |

### A.15.4:3.2 - Archetypal Grounding - High-Impact Reliance-Repair Slice

A lab manager sees a green tile for `CRISPR-guide-G42 ready` and a copied message saying the edit is approved. `A.15.4` does not ask the manager to decide whether the tile is a good UI. It asks what work or reliance claim is about to be made.

```text
A.15.4 local repair record:
  RelianceAppearanceRef: green guide-readiness tile plus copied approval-looking message
  RelianceAppearanceKind: dashboard display plus copied wording
  WorkOrRelianceUseKind: intended work
  WorkOrRelianceUseRef: proceed with the planned gene-editing work for sample batch B-17
  RequiredClaimBeforeUseRef: current protocol and current lab work plan for batch B-17
  RequiredInstitutedEffectBeforeUseRef: authorization for intervention when carried by an approval act or gate decision
  ClaimOrEffectPatternRef: A.2.9 or A.21 for authorization, A.2.1 for role assignment, A.10 for evidence and currentness, A.15.2 for the work plan
  ClaimOrEffectPositionKind: speech-act ref, gate decision, role-assignment ref, evidence relation, currentness relation, and work-plan record
  ClaimOrEffectPositionRef: positions named by the project records for batch B-17
  ProjectSideClaimOrEffectRef: current protocol publication, approval record or gate record when required, role assignment, evidence relation, currentness relation, and A.15.2 work plan
  AllowedUseNow: source-finding and source-relation refresh; no intervention until the required records and relations are named
  AppearanceOverreadBlocked: tile color and copied message do not authorize biological work or prove safety
  RecoveryOrStopCondition: reopen when the protocol, approval record or gate decision, evidence relation, role assignment, and work plan are current for batch B-17
```

### A.15.4:4.1 - Bias-Annotation

A.15.4 corrects appearance-based reliance. A publication face, dashboard tile, credential view, generated explanation, copied approval, provenance mark, schema wording, or API response can look ready for work before the governing pattern position and project-side FPF reference are named. The pattern keeps the reliance appearance separate from the source relation or other governing relation that carries the claim.

It also corrects over-repair bias. Not every reliance appearance being used as a reason for work or reliance needs a full dossier. The local repair record names the reliance appearance, work or reliance use, required claim or instituted effect, claim/effect position, allowed current use, blocked appearance overread, and recovery or stop condition at the smallest useful depth for the work or reliance question.

### A.15.4:4 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement (Normative Predicate) | Purpose and Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC-A15.4-1 (Work-relevant appearance-based reliance repair)** | Before an authority-looking case guides work or reliance, a conforming `A.15.4` use produces the ordinary local repair record: `RelianceAppearanceRef`, `RelianceAppearanceKind`, `WorkOrRelianceUseKind`, `WorkOrRelianceUseRef`, `RequiredClaimBeforeUseRef`, `RequiredInstitutedEffectBeforeUseRef`, `ClaimOrEffectPatternRef`, `ClaimOrEffectPositionKind`, `ClaimOrEffectPositionRef`, `ProjectSideClaimOrEffectRef`, `AllowedUseNow`, `AppearanceOverreadBlocked`, and `RecoveryOrStopCondition`. The record names the governing pattern and governing position that carry the requested claim or instituted effect; if that value is absent or stale, the disposition is limited to orientation, source-finding, contested use, governing-position repair request, bounded reversible probe, or blocked unsupported claim. | Prevents appearance-based reliance while keeping ordinary use cheap. |
| **CC-A15.4-2 (P2W publication use boundary)** | A principle scheme, functional diagram, scenario, screen, or explanation that exposes a P2W chain guides only the `A.15` work or planning kind selected by the project use: method-family selection, selected method, `U.WorkPlan`, dated `U.Work`, work-result record, or result measurement. Claims outside that selected use require their own governing pattern position or source relation named by value. | Keeps P2W publication use tied to the work use under repair instead of turning publication form into project authority. |
| **CC-A15.4-3 (Lowering and refresh)** | When the governing pattern, governing pattern position, source-currentness relation, revocation relation, affected work target, relying context, or time window cannot be recovered, the disposition for the work or reliance claim is orientation, source-finding, contested use, bounded reversible probe, repair request, or blocked unsupported claim. The record states the return or refresh condition for changes to source currentness, revocation, governing decision, evidence relation, role-state register, credential-status register, context-state record, copied-source relation, generated-source relation, or publication relation. | Keeps A.15.4 useful without admitting source as a new kind. |

### A.15.4:5 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

- **Appearance as source relation.** A dashboard tile, credential display, copied approval, generated explanation, provenance label, command-like cue, or composed source-relation chain is used as if presentation itself carried the work-relevant source relation. First name the work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, or P2W chain position under repair, then recover the governing pattern and governing pattern position for the requested claim or effect. If that value is missing, lower only the unsupported reliance.

### A.15.4:6 - Consequences

| Consequence | Trade-off and cost | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Work can continue at the lightest relation-governed level instead of stopping on every suspicious display. | The practitioner names the claim being made and governing pattern position or project reference before relying on the appearance. | Use the ordinary local repair record first; use fuller fields only for high-impact or contested reliance. |
| Appearance-based approval, evidence, assurance, gate, and work-occurrence overreads are blocked. | Some convenient dashboard or copied-text shortcuts become unusable until source-currentness relation is recovered. | Keep orientation, source-finding, and bounded reversible probes available when no external-impact reliance is being made. |
| Repeated ambiguity becomes governing pattern or source-relation repair work rather than repeated manual heroics. | The repair may reveal missing register entries, stale `U.EpistemePublication` records that expose source relations, or underspecified gate and evidence relations. | Assign only prospective repair work or source-relation gap work; do not backdate evidence, gate passage, work occurrence, or assurance. |

### A.15.4:7 - Rationale

A.15.4 exists because work often first meets a source expression, source `U.Episteme`, source `U.EpistemePublication`, source-bearing relation, or composed source-relation chain through a display, publication face, generated explanation, copied statement, credential view, dashboard tile, schema wording, or API wording before the governing pattern position and project-side reference are visible. The pattern protects work momentum and recoverability together: it lets the practitioner use the reliance appearance for orientation or bounded source-finding, while preventing that appearance from becoming approval, evidence, assurance, gate passage, performed work, release authorization, role-assignment currentness, role-state currentness, or credential-status currentness by appearance.

The pattern is deliberately a local repair relation, not a new authority relation. Once the evidence, gate, assurance, speech-act, commitment, role-assignment, role-state, credential-status, context-state, work-occurrence, publication, or boundary claim named by value is recovered, the pattern that governs that claim carries it directly.

### A.15.4:8 - SoTA-Echoing

**SoTA alignment rule.** Interpret each row here as source idea -> local FPF invariant -> practical local test -> popular shortcut rejected. A source citation governs nothing by reputation; it counts only when the cited idea is translated into the Solution, conformance checks, boundary rules, worked slices, and relations of this pattern.

| Claim need | Source idea and current named object | Current object or relation ref | Local FPF invariant and practical local test | Adopted invariant, adapted invariant, and rejected shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dynamic authorization or policy-response displays need requested operation named by value, affected resource or work target, context, and window relation. | Dynamic authorization practice separates subject, requested operation, affected resource or work target, context, and window before a relying use is allowed. | NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture; Cedar Policy Language Reference Guide v4.5; OpenFGA authorization-modeling docs; source maturity = current standards, specifications, and widely used technical practice. | The local repair record names the work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, or P2W chain position under repair, the affected resource or work target, affected claim when one is being made, policy version, context, and time window before treating a visible allow response, deny response, or policy response as a relation-governed source relation for work or reliance. | **Adopt, adapt, reject.** Adopt bounded currentness, source-relation, and relation-governed-use invariants; adapt them through FPF project records named by value; reject treating policy-looking output as permission or work-relevant source relation by display. |
| Credential or register-backed credential-status or role-state needs issuer, holder, verifier, currentness, and relying-context fields. | Credential and state practice separates issuer, holder binding or subject binding, verifier context, relying context, proof result or credential-status result, governing register entry, revocation, freshness, and effective window. | W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0 Recommendation and current digital identity or register-backed status practice; source maturity = current specifications and technical practice. | A credential view, credential-status tile, or role-state tile can carry only the holder claim, credential-status claim, role-state claim, or currentness claim whose issuer, register, proof result or credential-status result, revocation, freshness, and relying context are recoverable. | **Adopt, adapt, reject.** Adopt credential-currentness, role-state-currentness, and source-currentness separation; reject treating a badge, screenshot, or register excerpt as role assignment, deontic permission, gate passage, or work reliance without the governing pattern relation for that current use. |
| Provenance and attestation marks need source relation and process-trace relation without becoming truth, release, or work evidence. | Provenance and attestation practice separates origin relation, process traceability relation, build claim, supply-chain claim, and verification metadata from truth of downstream claims, release authorization, or deontic permission. | C2PA Specifications 2.4 content provenance and attestations; SLSA v1.2 provenance; in-toto Statement v1 attestations; source maturity = current standards, specifications, and widely used practice. | A provenance or attestation mark remains source relation or process-trace relation until `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `A.15.1`, or another source relation named by value carries the downstream claim. | **Adopt, adapt, reject.** Adopt source traceability and process traceability; reject provenance-mark-as-truth, release authorization, deontic permission, gate passage, assurance, or work occurrence. |
| Change, gate, release, and approval displays need decision, schedule, and performed-work separation. | Release and change practice separates approval acts, authorization acts, gate decisions, planned schedules, and performed work. | ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2023 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 life-cycle process separation; ITIL 4 Change Enablement and current release and change practice; source maturity = current life-cycle standards plus mature service-management practice. | A dashboard or approval-looking display supports reliance only when it exposes the `GateDecision`, `SpeechAct`, `Commitment`, `U.WorkPlan`, or dated `A.15.1` work occurrence that carries the claim named by value or effect, plus the evidence or provenance relation needed for reliance. | **Adopt, adapt, reject.** Adopt decision, schedule, and performed-work separation; reject a green tile, copied approval, or generated explanation as rollout, release, or work reliance by appearance. |

**Digital-identity and provenance boundary.** The W3C Verifiable Credentials, C2PA, SLSA, in-toto, Cedar-style, Zanzibar-style, NIST, and ITIL sources are used for currentness, credential-status, role-state, provenance, authorization source-relation fields, and change-practice fields. They do not turn a visible credential, provenance label, attestation, policy response, register excerpt, or dashboard display into work occurrence, gate passage, deontic permission, assurance, release, or project claim relation without the governing pattern relation required by `A.15.4`, `A.15`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, or `A.21`.

The nearest recovery references are the worked dashboard and approval examples, `CC-A15.4-1`, `CC-A15.4-2`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, `A.21`, `A.2.8`, `A.2.9`, and `A.15.1`. If a SoTA row cannot be recovered through those local checks, do not let the source citation stand in for the local `A.15.4` rule.

* **E.10 and E.10.MOVE relation-selection rule:** When `E.10` encounters source-relation, authority, permission, approval, readiness, role, role-state, credential-status, green-tile, generated-explanation, copied-review, credential, provenance, dashboard, or move-like wording that is being used as a reason for work or reliance, `E.10.MOVE` repairs move or readiness wording first when it hides pattern-use or work-entry-readiness claims, and `E.10.ARCH` selects `A.15.4` only after excluding or assigning direct evidence (`A.10`), assurance (`B.3`), work-entry readiness (`A.15.5`), gate (`A.21`), constraint (`A.20`), boundary or use-boundary wording (`A.6` and `A.6.B`), role-assignment or context-state relation (`A.2.1`), speech act (`A.2.9`), commitment (`A.2.8`), work occurrence (`A.15.1`), and publication-face, publication-use, source-transfer, or explanation questions (`E.17`, `A.16.0`, and `E.17.EFP`). `A.15.4` records the local repair relation and the governing pattern position needed for the work or reliance claim; it does not replace those governing patterns.
* **A.15 boundary relation:** use `A.15` directly when the remaining question under repair is role, method, plan, and work alignment rather than a reliance appearance being used as a reason for work or reliance.

### A.15.4:9.1 - C.29 mathematical-lens use relation

> If a mathematical lens appears in work-relevant appearance-based reliance repair, use `C.29` only to state why the lens helps expose or bound a reliance appearance such as generated wording, dashboard cue, copied phrase, publication form, MVPK face, publication carrier, rendering, `PublicationUnit`, or source-finding cue. `A.15.4` still governs the reliance appearance, governing pattern position named by value, return or reopen condition, reliance relation, and whether that appearance can guide work under a recovered relation. Method choice, plans, and performed work remain governed by `A.15` and `A.15.1` when those claims are being made; a `C.29` lens-use result does not turn a cue, rendering, or diagnostic phrase into source relation.

### A.15.4:9.2 - P2W Result-Related Source Boundary

When a P2W use under `E.18.1` produces result wording, use this pattern only when a reliance appearance such as publication, dashboard, generated explanation, copied statement, provenance mark, schema wording, API wording, or composed source-relation chain is about to justify result-related work or reliance by appearance. No generic `WorkResult` kind is admitted.

Recover the governing pattern position and project-side reference before relying on any result-related cue: result artifact, resource ledger, launch-values-bound record, substitution record, telemetry, acceptance record, quality-evaluation record, done-state update, feedback pin, result measurement, evidence relation, assurance claim, parity relation, refresh relation, or role-assignment enactability claim. If the governing pattern or relation is missing, use the reliance appearance only for orientation or source-finding and block only the unsupported result-related work or reliance.

### A.15.4:9.3 - Lowering, Repair, and Refresh Conditions

Lower an `A.15.4` use when the work or reliance claim under repair, work-relevant P2W claim under repair, P2W chain position under repair, governing pattern, governing pattern position, relying context, time window, source-currentness relation, revocation relation, evidence relation, gate decision, assurance claim, speech-act ref, commitment, role-assignment relation, role-state record, credential-status record, context-state record, or dated work-occurrence record cannot be named for the intended use. The lowered use is orientation, source-finding, contested use, bounded reversible probe, repair request, or blocked unsupported claim.

Repair the local `A.15.4` record when source currentness, revocation, source-relation order, governing decision record, evidence relation, copied-source relation, generated-source relation, dashboard publication, credential view, role-state register, credential-status register, context-state record, boundary wording, or work-result cue changes. Repair the recovered value through the evidence, assurance, gate, constraint, speech-act, commitment, role-assignment, role-state, credential-status, context-state, work-occurrence, publication, or boundary-wording pattern governing the recovered claim when that recovered claim belongs outside A.15.4.

Refresh before allowing the reliance appearance to guide release, safety, compliance, delegated role-assignment or role-state, contested source relation, cross-context reuse, work-result reliance, external-impact reliance, or irreversible work. Stop the refresh at the smallest changed governing pattern value or source relation: reliance appearance, source `U.Episteme` for the current claim, `U.EpistemePublication` exposing the claim-bound source relation, governing pattern position, source-currentness relation, role-state record, credential-status record, context-state record, revocation record, gate relation, evidence relation, assurance relation, copied-source relation, generated-source relation, or work-governed relation.
