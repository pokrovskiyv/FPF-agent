## A.15.2 - U.WorkPlan

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**At a glance.** Use `U.WorkPlan` when the current claim is intended work: horizon, planned window, intended role requirements, planned constraints, resource budgets, dependencies, acceptance targets, and baselines for subsequent variance against performed `U.Work`.

**Use this when.** Use this pattern when a schedule, calendar, rota, Kanban ticket, Gantt bar, shift plan, rollout plan, reservation, planning cue, or P2W preparation note is being treated as a method, method description, performed work, evidence, approval, gate result, publication cue, query-plan representation, or database access-path representation. `U.WorkPlan` is an episteme for intended `U.Work`; it can coordinate action, but it does not make work happen.

**First output.** One plan record or `PlanItem` naming horizon, cadence, target `U.Method`, method-description source when current, planned window, intended role requirements or proposed `U.RoleAssignment`, planned constraints, resource budgets, dependencies, acceptance targets, planned baseline, and the variance relation expected when `U.Work` occurs.

**First-use checks.**
1. Name the intended work occurrence or work family that needs planning.
2. Recover target method, method-description source when current, planned window, role requirements, planned resources, dependencies, acceptance targets, baseline, and context.
3. Decide whether the encountered record, cue, or plan element is a `U.WorkPlan`, a method description, performed `U.Work`, a `SlotFillingsPlanItem`, evidence, gate claim, source-restoration case, publication-use cue, or declarative representation.
4. Declare `PlanItem` decomposition, dependency relation, and planned-baseline policy before using the plan for coordination or variance.
5. When work occurs, connect the `U.Work` record back to the `PlanItem` and record variance rather than rewriting the plan as if it had happened.

**Ordinary use.** For simple coordination, a compact `PlanItem` with intended method, window, role requirement, resource budget, dependency, acceptance target, and baseline is enough.

**Reliance-bearing use.** Use the fuller WorkPlan record when cross-role coordination, budget reservation, delivery commitment, gate preparation, audit expectation, cross-context acceptance, release preparation, evidence-reference notes, source-currentness requests, or P2W carry-through depends on the plan.

**Stop condition.** Stop once the intended work is coordinated at the needed granularity or the encountered record, cue, or plan element is assigned to method, method description, performed work, evidence, gate, publication-use, declarative-representation, or source-restoration use without claiming to be a plan.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Teams treat calendars, tickets, reservations, or rollout notes as if work already happened, or treat a plan as method, evidence, gate result, approval, or publication authority.

**What this buys.** One intended-work record that keeps horizon, window, intended role requirements, constraints, budgets, dependencies, acceptance targets, baseline, and subsequent variance against performed `U.Work` inspectable.

**Not this pattern when.** Not this pattern when the current claim is a dated performed work occurrence (`A.15.1`), a `SlotFillingsPlanItem` (`A.15.3`), a visible source cue needing work-relevant restoration (`A.15.4`), a method (`A.3.1`), a method description (`A.3.2`), evidence or assurance (`A.10` or `B.3`), a gate or constraint decision (`A.20` or `A.21`), publication-use behavior (`E.17`), or a declarative representation overread as a work-control or method claim (`C.2.P.DR`).

### A.15.2:1 - Context (plain‑language motivation)

Operations happen in **time**. Even with perfect roles, abilities, and methods, nothing ships unless we **decide when and by whom** concrete runs **should** happen, under what **constraints** and **budgets**. Teams need a first-class concept for **plans and schedules** that does **not** get confused with:

* the **semantic “way of doing”** (that is `U.Method`),
* the **written recipe** (that is `U.MethodDescription`),
* the **performed work occurrence** (that is `U.Work`), or
* the **state laws** (that is `U.Dynamics`).

`U.WorkPlan` is that missing intended-work record.

### A.15.2:2 - Problem (what breaks without `WorkPlan`)

1. **“Workflow = schedule” conflation.** Flowcharts or code are used as calendars; resource clashes and SLA misses follow.
2. **Plan and run blur.** Gantt bars or Kanban tickets are reported as if the work already happened; audits and costing degrade.
3. **Specification and time leakage.** People and calendars creep into MethodDescriptions; reuse and staffing agility collapse.
4. **No variance model.** Without planned baselines, deviations in time, cost, and quality cannot be explained or improved.
5. **Structure entanglement.** BoM and org charts get baked into “process” views; plans become brittle and unmaintainable.

### A.15.2:3 - Forces (what we must balance)

| Force                              | Tension we resolve                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universality vs. domain idioms** | One plan concept that fits hospitals, fabs, data centers, and research labs—while honoring local terms. |
| **Commitment vs. flexibility**     | Plans must be firm enough to coordinate, yet easy to update as reality changes.                         |
| **Intended performer vs. performed-work assignee** | Plans may name intended performers; the assignment used for performed work must still be checked for the work interval. |
| **Budgets vs. actuals**            | Plans state targets and reservations; only `U.Work` records actual spend.                                   |
| **Decomposition vs. mapping**      | Plan tasks decompose conveniently; they do not force a shape on actual Work runs.                       |

### A.15.2:4 - Solution - `U.WorkPlan` as the time-bound intention for `U.Work`

#### A.15.2:4.1 - Definition

**`U.WorkPlan`** is an **`U.Episteme`** that **declares intended `U.Work` occurrences** over a horizon, with **planned windows**, **dependencies**, **intended performers** as role kinds or proposed `U.RoleAssignment`s, **resource budgets and reservations**, and **acceptance targets** within a `U.BoundedContext`.

> **Strict distinction (memory aid):**
> **Method** = *how in principle*. **MethodDescription** = *how it is written*.
> **WorkPlan** = *when, by whom in intent, under which constraints*.
> **Work** = *how it went this time*.

#### A.15.2:4.2 - `PlanItem` values (what a `WorkPlan` is made of)

A `U.WorkPlan` **contains `PlanItem` values** (think: scheduled tasks or operations), each of which typically states:

1. **Target Method and specification** — the **Method** to be enacted and the **MethodDescription** intended for enactment.
2. **Planned window** — e.g., earliest start and latest finish, timebox, recurrence (cron-like), blackout periods.
3. **Role requirements** — **role kinds** required (not people), optional proposed `U.RoleAssignment`s if pre-assignment is allowed in the context.
4. **Capability thresholds** — minimal abilities required of the performer, checked for the performed-work interval.
5. **Resource budgets and reservations** — planned energy, materials, machine slots, money, and reservations on assets.
6. **Dependencies** — precedence, overlap permissions, required gate references, and required approval references.
7. **Acceptance targets** — quality windows and SLA targets to be judged when Work completes.
8. **Location and asset constraints** — where the run is expected to take place.
9. **Links to Service promises** (if any) — external commitments that this plan aims to satisfy.

> **Didactic guardrail:** **No logs or actuals** belong in a WorkPlan; **no step logic** or solver internals either - that is the Method or MethodDescription.

#### A.15.2:4.3 - Clear distinctions for schedule, process, and workflow wording

| If you say…                                 | In FPF it is…                                        | Why                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| "The **schedule** for tomorrow's surgeries" | **`U.WorkPlan`**                                     | Calendar of intended runs with who and when constraints. |
| "The **workflow** for appendectomy"         | **`U.MethodDescription`** and `U.Method`             | Recipe and semantic way, not a calendar.          |
| "The **process** already ran at 10:00"      | **`U.Work`**                                         | A dated run with resources and outcomes.          |
| "The **thermodynamic trajectory**"        | **`U.Work`** occurrence plus **`U.Dynamics`** model  | A realized trajectory plus its model, not a plan. |
| "The **plan** assigns Dr. Lee"              | **WorkPlan** naming an intended `U.RoleAssignment`   | Assignment is still checked for the work interval.        |
| "The **budget** for Shift-B"                | **WorkPlan** (planned ledger)                        | Actual costs land on **Work**, not on the plan.   |

> **Schedule-word guard.** Schedule-like words do not determine the kind by themselves. Use `U.WorkPlan` only when intended work, horizon or window, role constraints, resource constraints, dependencies, acceptance target, and baseline are current; otherwise recover method, method description, work, evidence, gate, publication-use, or declarative-representation claims separately.

#### A.15.2:4.4 - Plan mereology (composition of plans ≠ composition of methods or runs)

Keep three separations crystal‑clear:

* **Method composition** (design-time semantics) -> produces **new Methods**.
* **Work composition** (run-time occurrences) -> produces **parent and child runs** with overlaps and episodes.
* **Plan mereology** (epistemic structure) -> organizes **`PlanItem` values** for coordination (phases, sprints, shifts), with **precedence** and **resource reservations**.

**Common relations among `PlanItem` values:**

* **`Precedes_pl` or `DependsOn_pl`** — start and finish constraints and gates.
* **`MayOverlap_pl` or `MutuallyExclusive_pl`** — allowed overlaps versus exclusive windows.
* **`Refines_pl`** — a child `PlanItem` tightens windows and budgets of a parent.
* **`Alternative_pl`** — planned alternatives (e.g., backup rig, backup team).

**Didactic rule:** A `PlanItem` **does not force** an identical Work shape; mapping is via **fulfilment** and **variance** (see §6).

#### A.15.2:4.5 - How `WorkPlan` Meets `Work` (Fulfilment and Variance)

When reality happens, each `U.Work` may:

* **Fulfil** a `PlanItem` — link `plannedAs → PlanItem`.
* **Partially fulfil** — multiple Work instances share one `PlanItem` (e.g., split run), or one Work fulfils several `PlanItem` values (e.g., consolidated batch).
* **Deviate** - occur with method or method-description substitution, different window, different performer, or policy exception.
* **Be unplanned** — Work with no `PlanItem` (emergency or ad hoc); must be labeled as such.

**Variance dimensions** the plan expects to report on:

* **Schedule variance (Δt):** early or late versus planned window.
* **Cost variance (Δc):** actual resource spend vs budget.
* **Scope variance:** different Method or MethodDescription than planned (with justification).
* **Quality variance:** acceptance verdict vs target.
* **Assignment variance:** intended versus actual `U.RoleAssignment`.

> **Manager’s view:** A plan that cannot report variance is a calendar picture, not a management tool.

### A.15.2:5 - What a good `WorkPlan` states (review checklist)

Use this as a human-facing checklist (not a rigid schema):

1. **Horizon & cadence** (e.g., “W36 surgeries, daily ETL”).
2. **`PlanItem` values** with: target Method and MethodDescription, planned windows, dependencies.
3. **Role requirements** (kinds) and **intended assignments** (optional, context‑lawful).
4. **Capability thresholds** and **safety envelopes**.
5. **Resource budgets** and **reservations** on assets.
6. **Acceptance targets** (SLA and quality windows).
7. **Bridges** if plan spans **multiple contexts** (operations, audit, or regulatory).
8. **Baseline and version** plus **change notes** (so variance is attributable).
9. **Policy pointers** (episode policy, overlap policy for Work roll‑ups if needed for KPIs).
10. **Exception relation** (how ad hoc or emergency work is related back to planning, if that relation is needed).

### A.15.2:6 - Archetypal grounding (parallel domains)

#### A.15.2:6.1 - Hospital OR day plan (shift rota + cases)

* **WorkPlan:** `OR_DayPlan_2025‑08‑12`.
* **`PlanItem` values:** `Case#1 Appendectomy`, `Case#2 Hernia`, with windows, context assignments, and surgeon **role kinds**; anesthetist intended `U.RoleAssignment` provided.
* **Budgets:** OR time blocks, consumables envelopes.
* **Fulfilment:** Each surgery Work links to its `PlanItem`; variances computed (over-run time, substitutions).

#### A.15.2:6.2 - Fab maintenance weekend (asset reservations)

* **WorkPlan:** `Fab_Maintenance_W36`.
* **`PlanItem` values:** `Tool_42 chamber clean`, `Tool_13 calibration`; **MutuallyExclusive\_pl** with production slots.
* **Reservations:** nitrogen, DI water, metrology window.
* **Fulfilment:** Actual clean Work happens earlier; variance logged as **early** with cost underrun.

#### A.15.2:6.3 - Data‑center rollout (multi‑context plan)

* **WorkPlan:** `DC_Rollout_Phase‑2`.
* **Bridges:** Ops context ↔ Security Audit context (different acceptance targets).
* **`PlanItem` values:** `Deploy Service A`, `Pen-test A`; dependencies across contexts.
* **Fulfilment:** Deployment Work passes ops targets; audit Work passes after the deployment work, with variance reported per context.

### A.15.2:7 - Bias‑Annotation (as in E‑cluster)

* **Lenses tested:** `Did`, `Prag`, `Arch`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; meanings of windows, budgets, and permissions are **context-local** via `U.BoundedContext`.
* **Rationale:** Elevates **planning and scheduling** to a first-class episteme that coordinates Methods, `U.RoleAssignment`s, and Work without conflation.

### A.15.2:7a - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement | Practical test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CC-A15.2-1 | A conforming `U.WorkPlan` names intended `U.Work`, not performed work. | The record can state planned windows and baselines without claiming actuals. |
| CC-A15.2-2 | Each reliance-bearing `PlanItem` names target `U.Method`, method-description source when current, planned window, role requirement, planned resource budget, dependencies, and acceptance target. | A performer can prepare the intended work without treating the plan as performed work. |
| CC-A15.2-3 | Proposed `U.RoleAssignment`s remain intended assignments until checked for the performed-work interval by A.15 and A.15.1. | The plan does not accept the role assignment for that interval by publication alone. |
| CC-A15.2-4 | Actual cost, resource use, launch values, substitutions, telemetry, and outcomes belong to performed `U.Work`. | The plan points to the work record for actuals and variance. |
| CC-A15.2-5 | `PlanItem` decomposition does not force the same shape on performed work. | Fulfilment and variance relations explain split, consolidated, emergency, or substituted work. |
| CC-A15.2-6 | Cross-context planning names bridges before reusing planned windows, budgets, or acceptance targets across contexts. | Audit, regulatory, operations, and delivery contexts can judge the plan without hidden equivalence. |
| CC-A15.2-7 | Evidence, assurance, gate, launch-value, and result-measurement claims stay in the patterns that govern those relations. | The WorkPlan may state evidence-reference notes or requests, but it does not become evidence, assurance, gate passage, or result measurement. |

### A.15.2:7b - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

- **Plan-as-actual.** Do not treat a Gantt bar, Kanban ticket, shift rota, or calendar booking as performed work; create or cite the `U.Work` occurrence when work happens.
- **Workflow-as-schedule.** Do not treat a method description or flowchart as a plan; make a `U.WorkPlan` only when intended windows, constraints, role requirements, and baselines are current.
- **Assignment-by-plan.** Do not treat an intended performer in the plan as a `U.RoleAssignment` satisfying the governing role, holder, and bounded-context constraints for the work interval; validate assignment when the work occurrence is prepared or recorded.
- **Budget-as-cost.** Do not book planned budgets as actual resource use; actuals belong to `U.Work`.
- **Plan-shape overreach.** Do not force performed work to match plan decomposition; use fulfilment and variance relations.
- **Evidence-note-as-claim.** Do not treat evidence-reference notes, gate-preparation notes, or source-currentness requests as evidence, gate passage, assurance, or release permission.

### A.15.2:7c - Consequences

| Benefit | Trade-off and mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Plans become inspectable without being confused with performed work. | More explicit records; mitigate by using compact `PlanItem` values for ordinary coordination. |
| Variance becomes meaningful because planned baseline and performed work stay separate. | Requires discipline around baselines; keep baseline and version visible on the plan. |
| Cross-role and cross-context coordination becomes safer. | Requires bridge checks when contexts differ; name only the bridge needed for the planned use. |
| P2W carry-through can prepare work without pretending work already happened. | Use `A.15.1`, `A.15.3`, `A.15.4`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `A.20`, or `A.21` only when the performed-work, planned-baseline, source-restoration, evidence, assurance, gate, or constraint relation becomes current. |

### A.15.2:7d - SoTA Alignment

| Source tradition | Local invariant adopted | Shortcut rejected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operations planning, scheduling, and project-control practice | Planned windows, dependencies, budgets, and baselines are declared before work occurs and compared against actuals after work occurs. | Treating schedule presence as evidence that work occurred. |
| Lean, maintenance, and service-management planning practice | Plans coordinate role requirements, assets, constraints, and reservations while leaving performed work and variance to work records. | Treating a plan as a method, a gate, or a result. |
| Case-management and adaptive-work practice | Emergency and ad hoc work can be related back to planning through exception, fulfilment, and variance relations. | Forcing every performed work occurrence into the original plan shape. |
| Audit and quality-management practice | Baseline, version, acceptance target, and change note remain explicit so deviations can be explained. | Changing the plan after the fact to make variance disappear. |

### A.15.2:7e - Relations

* **Builds on:** `A.15` Role-Method-Work Alignment, `A.15.1` `U.Work`, `A.2.1` `U.RoleAssignment`, `U.Method`, and `U.MethodDescription`.
* **Coordinates with:** `A.15.3` for `SlotFillingsPlanItem` values, `A.15.4` for work-relevant source restoration, `A.10` for evidence-provenance relations, `B.3` for assurance, `A.20` and `A.21` for gates and constraint decisions, and `E.17` for publication-use questions.
* **Used by:** P2W carry-through when principle-to-work reasoning reaches WorkPlanning and must keep plan, performed work, evidence, gate, and result-measurement relations separate.

### A.15.2:8 - P2W WorkPlanning Use Relation

When `E.18.1` reaches WorkPlanning, `U.WorkPlan` states intended work occurrences, planned windows, intended role requirements, planned constraints, resource budgets, acceptance targets, evidence-reference notes, source-currentness requests, and `PlanItem` values.

If the same P2W source material also makes a performed-work, launch-value, evidence, gate, result, measurement, publication-use, source-restoration, or refresh claim, write that meaning as a separate current relation before using the plan.

### A.15.2:9 - Launch-Value Boundary For P2W

For P2W use, `U.WorkPlan` may state planned values, planned fillers, constraints, reservations, intended performers, and evidence-reference notes. Launch values are finalized only at performed-work entry under the current gate relation and performed-work pattern and are recorded with the performed `U.Work` and related gate and provenance records when current.

### A.15.2:10 - Lowering, Repair, and Refresh Conditions

Lower a candidate `U.WorkPlan` claim when horizon, planned window, target method, method-description source when current, role requirement, planned constraint, resource budget, dependency, acceptance target, or baseline cannot be named at the granularity required by the next planning move. The acceptable lowered result is a planning cue, method-description note, source-gap note, source-restoration request, publication-use cue, declarative-representation note, or evidence-reference note, not a conforming WorkPlan.

Repair the WorkPlan when a subsequent source changes the intended method, planned window, role requirement, planned resource budget, dependency, acceptance target, baseline, version, bridge, or exception policy. Repair the plan; do not rewrite performed `U.Work` unless the work record itself changed, and do not make the repaired plan into evidence that the work occurred.

Refresh before relying on a WorkPlan for cross-context coordination, budget reservation, release preparation, gate preparation, evidence-reference use, performed-work entry, result measurement, or P2W carry-through. If the claim being made after refresh is performed work, evidence, assurance, gate passage, publication use, declarative representation, or source restoration, use the governing pattern for that relation and keep only the returned WorkPlan relation here.

### A.15.2:End
