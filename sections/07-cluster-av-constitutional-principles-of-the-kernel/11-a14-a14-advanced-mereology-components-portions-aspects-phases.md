## A.14 - Advanced Mereology: Components, Portions, Aspects & Phases
> **Type:** Kernel mereology and part-whole relation discipline pattern
> **Status:** Stable

**At a glance.** Use A.14 when a part-whole claim must distinguish component, member, portion, aspect, or phase before downstream architecture, work, assurance, or U-kind admission relies on that claim.

**Use this when.** Use this pattern when a text says that something is part of something else, a collection member, some amount of the same stuff, an aspect of one holon, or the same holon during a time interval, and a wrong relation kind would change identity, aggregation, responsibility, evidence, or structural grounding.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Teams count members as components, portions as components, aspects as separate wholes, or phases as separate objects; constructive traces and Working-Model relation claims then ground the wrong EntityOfConcern.

**What this buys.** One human-facing mereology catalogue that lets B.3.5 and C.13 ground structural claims without inventing a new public relation vocabulary.

**Not this pattern when.** Not this pattern when the current question is only a constructive trace (`C.13`), Working-Model assurance grounding (`B.3.5`), meta-holon transition (`B.2`), temporal dynamics without a phase-of claim, or a general U-kind admission question (`E.24.UK`).

### A.14:1 - Problem frame - why an advanced mereology?

FPF’s holonic modelling relies on **part–whole** relations to build *structural* and *conceptual* holarchies for admitted holons such as systems, epistemes, work occurrences, bounded contexts, disciplines, and methods. But `U.Holon` is **not** a synonym for every bounded object. `U.Role` is a governed root U-kind, not an admitted holon kind. `U.Method` is a non-agentive holon kind, but submethod assembly is owned by method-composition patterns, not by A.14 structural component mereology. Role relation structures, method relation structures, method descriptions, work plans, and work occurrences enter A.14 only through their direct governing patterns and admitted carriers. Early drafts distinguished structural vs. conceptual parthood (e.g., **ComponentOf**, **ConstituentOf**) but practical modelling kept hitting two recurrent gaps:

1. **Quantities vs. parts.** Engineers routinely need “some of the fuel”, “the first 10 pages”, “a 30% subset of data”. This is not a component; it is a **portion** of a stuff‑like whole, governed by measures and conservation.

2. **Change vs. replacement.** Authors need to say “the prototype **before calibration**”, “v2 of the spec”, “shift 1 vs. shift 2 of the same run”. That is not a new whole; it is a **phase** of the same carrier across time.

This section introduces two **normative** sub‑relations of `partOf` that close those gaps and lock them to the rest of the kernel:

* **PortionOf** — metrical, measure‑preserving parthood of stuffs and other measurables.
* **PhaseOf** — temporal parthood of the *same* carrier across an interval.

It also restates guard‑rails that keep **role values** outside holon mereology and keep **method values** outside A.14 structural component mereology, while allowing method holarchy through method owners such as `A.3.1` and `B.1.5`. Describing epistemes such as `U.MethodDescription` and `U.WorkPlan` use ordinary episteme parthood and versioning like any other `U.Episteme`. It also clarifies how **MemberOf** fits: membership and collection-as-whole grounding start with A.14, C.13, and B.3.5 as appropriate; acting collective systems require `U.System` admission plus role, method, work, and evidence owners; whole reidentification uses B.2 only when existing-whole explanations fail.

**Publication note (Working-Model first).** Read A.14 together with **E.14 Human-Centric Working-Model** and **B.3.5 CT2R-LOG**: publish the direct relation claim in the **Working-Model** layer and, when assurance is sought for a structural claim, link that assertion downward to one current C.2.1 construction-trace episteme in the **Compose-CAL Γ_m** `sum`, `set`, or `slice` form. The trace reports exact participants, direct relation occurrences, the applicable construction rule, and identity or reidentification conditions. It creates none of them; order and time remain outside mereology.

### A.14:2 - Problem — what breaks without these distinctions?

If we only have “generic partOf” (plus Component/Constituent), four classes of errors appear:

1. **Conservation errors.** Treating “20 L of fuel from Tank A” as a component leads to nonsense: adding and removing such “components” does not respect quantities; Γ\_sys proofs violate Σ‑balance.

2. **Temporal smearing.** Flattening “before/after”, or “v1/v2” into one timeless whole collapses history; Γ\_time and Γ\_method cannot justify order‑sensitive properties; audits cannot reproduce conditions.

3. **Identity confusion.** Modelling “new version” as “new component” either breaks identity (it is still the *same* holon evolving) or hides a **Meta‑Holon Transition** when identity really changes.

4. **Role leakage.** Functional/organisational roles sneak into part trees (“the PumpRole is part of the plant”), violating A.15 and making structural reasoning brittle.

### A.14:3 - Forces

| Force                              | Tension                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expressiveness vs. Parsimony**   | We need new relations (Portion, Phase) ↔ we must keep the catalogue minimal and orthogonal.                     |
| **Universality vs. Domain nuance** | One set of rules must serve physical systems and epistemes ↔ measurement and time behave differently by domain. |
| **Identity vs. Change**            | Preserve “the same carrier through change” ↔ allow explicit re‑identification when invariants fail.             |
| **Static structure vs. Histories** | Part trees should be simple ↔ real work requires phased histories and measured slices.                          |

### A.14:4 - Solution — extend the mereology catalogue, keep it clean

**A.14 defines two additional sub‑relations of `partOf`** and **re‑affirms the firewall** between mereology and the role/recipe layer:

1. **PortionOf** — for *measured* parts of a whole (stuffs and other extensives).
2. **PhaseOf** — for *temporal* parts of the same carrier.
3. **No role values in holon mereology; no method values in structural component mereology.** `U.Role` is not an admitted holon kind. `U.Method` is a method holon, but its submethod assembly is governed by method-composition owners, not by A.14 `ComponentOf` or structural `partOf`. A `U.MethodDescription` is an **Episteme** and may be versioned or structured; `U.Work` occurrences may have work-occurrence parts under A.15.1; neither case replaces method holarchy.
4. **MemberOf stays, but collection identity and acting-collective claims use direct owners.** `MemberOf` remains available to state exact collection-membership occurrences. After the collection, its identity rule, and those memberships are independently grounded, `Γ_m.set` may narrate their construction account and B.3.5 may link that account when publication assurance is current. Neither the gathering narrative nor its trace creates a membership. An acting collective system uses `U.System` admission plus role, method, work, and evidence owners. Whole reidentification uses B.2 only when existing-whole explanations fail.

The classical pair **ComponentOf** (structural, discrete) and **ConstituentOf** (conceptual, logical/epistemic) remain as in the kernel; A.14 only clarifies **how to tell them apart from Portion/Phase** (§ 6).

### A.14:5 - Formal cores (normative semantics)

#### A.14:5.1 - PortionOf — metrical part of a measurable whole

**Intent.** Capture “some of the same stuff/extent”, governed by a measure that adds up.

**Applicability.** Any `U.Holon` that carries an **extensive** measure μ on the chosen scope
(examples: mass, volume, length‑of‑text, byte size, wall‑time budget).

**Primitive.** `PortionOf(x, y)` means: *x is the same kind of stuff/content as y, but less*.

**Axioms (A14‑POR‑\*)**

* **POR‑1 (Partial order).** PortionOf is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive on its domain.
* **POR‑2 (Metrical dominance).** If `x ProperPortionOf y` then `0 < μ(x) < μ(y)` for the agreed μ.
* **POR‑3 (Additivity on disjoint portions).** If `x ⟂ y` (no overlap) and both PortionOf y, then `μ(x ⊔ y) = μ(x)+μ(y)` and `x ⊔ y PortionOf y`.
* **POR‑4 (Kind integrity).** x and y must share the same **measure kind** and **unit** (or a declared conversion).
* **POR‑5 (Boundary compatibility).** For physical wholes, the whole’s boundary encloses the union of its portions; cross‑boundary “leaks” are interactions, not portions.

**Didactic tests.**
✔ “5 kg from a 20 kg billet” — PortionOf.
✔ “Pages 1–10 of the report” — PortionOf (μ = page or token count).
✘ “The pump module of the plant” — **ComponentOf**, not PortionOf.
✘ “The Methods section of the paper” — **ConstituentOf**, not PortionOf.

#### A.14:5.2 - PhaseOf — temporal part of the same carrier

**Intent.** Capture “the same holon during a sub‑interval”, preserving identity through change.

**Applicability.** Any `U.Holon` that persists across time with a recognised **carrier identity**.

**Primitive.** `PhaseOf(x, y)` means: *x is y restricted to a proper time interval*.

**Axioms (A14‑PHA‑\*)**

* **PHA‑1 (Partial order).** PhaseOf is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive (on the same carrier).
* **PHA‑2 (Coverage).** The whole is the union of its maximal, non‑overlapping phases over its lifetime interval.
* **PHA‑3 (No paradoxical overlap).** Phases of the **same carrier** do not overlap in time; overlapping variants require `PhaseOf` on *aspects* or different carriers.
* **PHA‑4 (Identity through change).** Properties may vary between phases, but the carrier’s identity criteria hold continuously (e.g., same serial number, same legal identity, same theorem statement).
* **PHA‑5 (Escalation to MHT).** If identity criteria break (e.g., metamorphosis with new objectives), **declare a Meta‑Holon Transition (B.2)** rather than a PhaseOf.

**Didactic tests.**
✔ “PumpUnit\#3 **before** calibration” — PhaseOf(Pump\#3\_pre, Pump\#3).
✔ “Spec v2” — PhaseOf(Spec\_v2, Spec), on the **MethodDescription** episteme.
✔ “Shift 1 of the same batch run” — PhaseOf(Work\_shift1, Work).
✘ “Prototype vs. production unit” — likely **different carriers**; use ComponentOf/ConstituentOf or MHT per criteria.

#### A.14:5.3 - CT2R‑LOG & Compose‑CAL handshake *(normative link)*

* A **structural relation claim** published in the Working-Model layer **SHALL**, when assurance is required, link through `tv:groundedBy` to one current C.2.1 construction-trace episteme in the `Γ_m.sum | Γ_m.set | Γ_m.slice` form (see **B.3.5** and **C.13**). The direct relation pattern decides whether the occurrence obtains and how it is identified; the candidate's direct identity or reidentification rule decides continuity. The trace only reports that basis.
* **PhaseOf** is **temporal parthood**; it **SHALL NOT** be grounded through `Γ_m`. Its assurance follows identity-through-time criteria (CC-PHA-1..3) and `Γ_time` ordering (B.1.4).
* **MemberOf** remains **non-mereological** (CC-MEM-2). A `set` trace is truthful only after one exact collection, its identity rule, and the exact direct membership occurrences are grounded; no **ComponentOf** inference follows.

Two quick identity tests apply before relying on a trace. The same listed constituents can form a different whole when their direct assembly relations or rule differ. Conversely, a permitted constituent replacement can preserve the same whole. An equal input list, a repeated trace, or `validationMode=axiomatic` decides neither case.

### A.14:6 - Choosing the right relation (decision table)

| You want to say…                                             | Use                  | Why                                                                                |

| “This is a *piece* of the same stuff (lower amount/extent).” | **PortionOf**        | Governed by a measure μ and conservation (Σ‑additive).                             |
| “This is a *discrete part* that sits *inside* the whole.”    | **ComponentOf**      | Structural parthood; boundary‑respecting, not measured by μ.                       |
| “This is a *logical part* in a conceptual whole.”            | **ConstituentOf**    | Sections, lemmas, clauses, conceptual assembly.                                    |
| “This is the *same entity* during a *sub‑interval*.”          | **PhaseOf**          | Temporal slicing with identity continuity.                                         |
| “This *item belongs to that collection/collective*.”         | **MemberOf**         | State the exact membership occurrence and the collection's identity rule. If assurance is current, C.13 may narrate the already grounded collection in a `Γ_m.set` trace and B.3.5 may link it; the gathering account does not create membership or component integration. |
| “This system *plays a Role or position*.”          | **playsRole** (A.15) | Roles are contextual masks, never parts.                                           |

> **Firewall reminder.** If your sentence is about *who does what*, *how it is done*, or *what happened when* (role, method, or run), you are likely in **A.15**. If it is about the **document or carrier** (its pages/sections/versions), you may still be in **A.14** (Episteme mereology).

### A.14:7 - Archetypal Grounding

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PortionOf**                  | 50 L from a 200 L fuel tank (μ = volume).              | Pages 1–10 from a 120‑page report (μ = page/token count).   |

| **PhaseOf**                    | PumpUnit\#3 *before*/*after* calibration (same serial). | Spec v1 → v2 (same document lineage).                       |
| MemberOf (for reference) | “is an element of a collection/collective”; use only after the exact collection, its identity rule, and the direct membership occurrence are grounded. A C.13 `Γ_m.set` trace can report that construction and B.3.5 can link it for assurance; neither the trace nor a gathering act creates membership. Acting-collective claims require separate `U.System` admission plus role, method, work, and evidence owners. | The same rule applies to collections of epistemes; listing or publishing them supplies no membership occurrence by itself. |

### A.14:8 - Bias-Annotation

A.14 corrects parthood bias: ordinary words such as part, member, phase, aspect, section, version, module, function, role, and ingredient can all sound like "part of" while naming different relation kinds. The repair is not a larger part tree. Recover the EntityOfConcern and choose the relation kind: component, constituent, portion, phase, member, role assignment, method description, work occurrence, evidence relation, or transformation relation.

It also corrects representation bias. A BoM row, figure, graph edge, table row, document section, dashboard item, or architecture view may publish a part-whole claim, but the publication form is not the part-whole relation itself. The live A.14 claim is about the relation between holons, epistemes, carriers, portions, phases, or collection members, with mathematical or publication descriptions kept in their own slots.

If another pattern admits a different carrier, such as a method description, work occurrence, role assignment record, role relation structure, method relation structure, or episteme, name that carrier and governing pattern. | Keeps role values out of holon mereology and keeps method holarchy out of structural component mereology while preserving admitted carriers. |
| **CC‑A14‑0a** | `U.MethodDescription` / `U.WorkPlan` and other describing epistemes **MAY** participate in `partOf` only as `U.Episteme` nodes (e.g., `ConstituentOf`, text `PortionOf`, version `PhaseOf`); they **MUST NOT** be asserted as `ut:StructPartOf` of any `U.System`. | Allows document structure/versioning without smuggling Methods into structure. |
| **CC‑A14‑0b** | `MemberOf` **MUST NOT** imply, entail, or be auto‑rewritten into any `partOf` sub‑relation. | Separates collections/collectives from parthood.        |
| **CC‑A14‑0c** | `SerialStepOf` / `ParallelFactorOf` **MUST NOT** appear in any `partOf` chain or table in A.14; model order and concurrency potential via **A.15** and direct method-composition owners such as `B.1.5`.

| ID                 | Requirement                                                                                                                                                              | Purpose                                                                                 |

| **CC-A14-10**      | A published structural Working-Model assertion **SHALL** set the author-declared assurance posture `validationMode=axiomatic` and link to one current C.2.1 construction-trace episteme with `tv:groundedBy -> Γ_m.sum\|set\|slice`. The direct relation and reidentification tests remain decisive; the trace and mode create neither occurrence nor identity and guarantee no timelessness. | Aligns A.14 with B.3.5 and C.13 while keeping ontology, identity, assurance posture, and currentness distinct. |
| **CC‑A14‑11**      | **PhaseOf** edges **SHALL NOT** use Γ_m for grounding. The relation record **SHALL** provide identity criteria and non‑overlap per **CC‑PHA‑1..3** and reference **Γ_time** when ordering matters. | Keeps temporal parthood distinct from construction; preserves the plane firewall.       |

### A.14:9.1 - Relation-use decision procedure

**Step 0 — Firewall check.**
If your sentence is about *who does what*, *how it is done* (role or method), or *what happened when* (run or work occurrence), you are **not** in A.14 merely because ordinary speech names a thing. Use the role, method, work, or evidence owner. If it is about the **carrier episteme** (pages/sections/versions of an SOP/algorithm/spec), or about a dated work occurrence with recovered work-part relation, A.14 may participate through that admitted carrier.

**Step 1 — Is it measured stuff?**
If yes, pick **PortionOf**. Confirm μ is declared (CC‑POR‑1/2). Test additivity on a toy split (CC‑POR‑3). If flows cross a boundary, remodel as interactions, not portions (CC‑POR‑4).

**Step 2 — Is it a discrete inside part?**
If yes, pick **ComponentOf** (physical) or **ConstituentOf** (conceptual). Do **not** use PortionOf here.

**Step 3 — Is it the same carrier at a time slice?**
If yes, pick **PhaseOf**. Verify identity criteria and non‑overlap (CC‑PHA‑1/2/3). If criteria break, escalate to **B.2** (CC‑PHA‑4).

**Step 4 — Is it a membership statement?**
Use **MemberOf** only; avoid any part‑inferences (CC‑MEM‑2). If you need a **collection as a whole**, use **C.13** (`Γ_m.set`) and **B.3.5** when assurance grounding is current. If you need **collective action**, first admit an acting collective `U.System`, then use the role, method, work, and evidence owners.

**Quick spot-tests.**

| Smell                          | Likely error                      | Fix                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “20% of the chassis”           | Treating structure as stuff       | Use **ComponentOf**; if truly laminar material, PortionOf applies to **material stock**, not the assembled chassis.          |
| “Chapter 2 is 15% of the book” | Mixing measures and constituents  | Use **ConstituentOf**; the 15% is **length‑of‑text** as a separate statement.                                                |
| “Spec v2 overlaps v1”          | Overlapping phases on same aspect | Use `PhaseOf(Spec_v2, Spec)` with non‑overlap; represent drafting as **Work** episodes (A.15) rather than overlapping specs. |
| “Team is part of the project”  | Member vs part confusion          | Use **MemberOf(Team, ProjectCollective)**, not partOf.                                                                       |

### A.14:9.2 - Interplay with Γ‑flavours (how these relations behave under aggregation)

| Γ‑flavour                    | Mereological hooks (what A.14 supplies)                                                                                                                | Key effect                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Γ\_sys (B.1.2)**          | Treat **PortionOf** as Σ‑additive stocks; **ComponentOf** must respect boundary integration; **PhaseOf** is not aggregated here.                       | Conserves extensive measures and keeps structural WLNK (weakest‑link) on components.          |
| **Γ\_epist (B.1.3)**         | **PortionOf** of texts/data uses μ = token/byte count; **ConstituentOf** composes arguments/sections; **PhaseOf** versions MethodDescriptions/documents.      | Preserves provenance and avoids trust inflation by keeping constituents vs portions distinct. |
| **Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time (B.1.4)** | **PhaseOf** provides the legal slicing for time; order/dependencies live in **Γ\_ctx** and method graphs (A.15/B.1.5). **PortionOf** is orthogonal (quantities inside steps/runs).                                      | Ensures chronological consistency and monotone coverage.                                      |
| **Γ\_method (B.1.5)**          | Recipes are **MethodDescription** graphs (not parthood). When a recipe refers to stuff‑like inputs, those are **PortionOf** statements on resources.          | Separates recipe composition from structure.                                                  |
| **Γ\_work (B.1.6)**          | Only **Work** carries resource deltas; when logging “consumed 5 kg from Tank A”, model it as **PortionOf** relation to the stock prior to consumption. | Makes Σ‑balance explicit; aligns with CC‑POR‑3/4.                                             |

### A.14:10 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* **Member as component.** A person, team, document, or object belongs to a collection and is then counted as if it were structurally integrated into the whole.
* **Role as part.** A system plays a role, and the role label is placed inside a part tree.
* **Method as part.** A method value, recipe, or algorithm is treated as a component instead of using method, method-description, work, or transformation owners.
* **Portion without measure.** Some amount of fuel, data, time, or text is named as a portion without a measure kind, unit, and additivity condition.
* **Phase as replacement.** A version or time slice is treated as a new component when the carrier identity continues, or as the same phase when the identity criteria fail.
* **Diagram or trace as relation.** A visual breakdown, graph, table, construction trace, or `validationMode` is used as proof that parthood obtains or that the whole has one fixed identity. Recover the direct relation occurrence and the candidate's identity or reidentification rule first; use the publication and trace only as inspectable accounts.

### A.14:11 - Pedagogy aids (non-normative)

**Two‑minute checklist for practitioners**

1. Do I see "process", "procedure", "policy", or "script" used to mean enactment? — then **A.15**. If it names a **carrier episteme** whose structure/version is being discussed, **A.14** may apply.
2. Does every PortionOf have a declared μ and unit?
3. Do phases cover a lifetime without overlap for the same aspect?
4. Are any roles/recipes appearing as parts? If yes, stop and refactor.

### A.14:12 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Predictable composition.** Σ‑additivity for portions and identity‑through‑time for phases make Γ‑proofs straightforward.
* **History without confusion.** Temporal slicing is explicit and audit‑ready; no paradoxical overlaps.
* **Cleaner integration with roles and recipes.** The firewall prevents “functional object” creep into structure.
* **Compatibility with engineering practice.** Mirrors *product breakdown* (components) vs *functional breakdown* (roles) vs *material stocks* (portions) vs *versioning* (phases).

**Trade‑offs / mitigations**

* **Modelling energy.** Authors must pick μ and declare units; provide a short μ‑catalog per project.
* **More relation names.** Two extra sub‑relations increase vocabulary; mitigated by the decision table (§ 6) and spot‑tests (§ 9).
* **Escalation discipline.** Deciding PhaseOf vs MHT requires judgement; A.14 provides criteria, and B.2 captures true re‑identification.

### A.14:13 - Rationale

A.14 exists because part-whole words carry identity, aggregation, measure, time, and assurance commitments. The pattern keeps those commitments in the relation kind instead of letting everyday nouns, diagrams, or breakdown tables decide ontology. Component, constituent, portion, phase, and member claims can then support holon, episteme, architecture, and evidence work without smuggling role, method, work, or publication claims into mereology.

### A.14:14 - SoTA-Echoing

* **Metrical mereology** advances (e.g., recent work on quantity‑based parthood and additivity) motivate **PortionOf** with explicit μ and Σ‑laws, preventing the classic “stuff as components” fallacy.
* **Temporal parts & identity through change** (renewed treatments in analytic metaphysics and formal ontology) motivate **PhaseOf** with coverage/non‑overlap and escalation when identity criteria fail.
* **Engineering ontologies (BORO lineage, Core Constructional practice, ISO 15926 family)** keep a strict separation between **functional breakdowns** (our Roles) and **product breakdowns** (our Components), with **stock/consumable** modelling (our Portions) handled by quantities, not by component trees.
* **Knowledge-episteme edition histories** in contemporary MBSE and open-science practice use explicit versioning (our PhaseOf) and provenance-preserving composition (our ConstituentOf).
* The net effect is a **minimal‑sufficient** catalogue: two added sub‑relations close real modelling gaps while preserving **parsimony**, **didactic clarity**, and **Γ‑compatibility** across domains.

### A.14:15 - Relations

- **Builds on:** `A.1`, `A.7`, `B.1`, `B.2`, `C.13`, and `B.3.5` for holon identity, strict distinction, gamma-flavour separation, meta-holon transition, constructive grounding, and Working-Model assurance.
- **Coordinates with:** `A.15`, `A.15.1`, `A.3.1`, `A.3.2`, and `A.3.4` when the source wording is about role assignment, method, work, or transformation rather than parthood.
- **Used by:** architecture, description, evidence, and U-kind admission patterns when their structural claim depends on a clean parthood relation.
