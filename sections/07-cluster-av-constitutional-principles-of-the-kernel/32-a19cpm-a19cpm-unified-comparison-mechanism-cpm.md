### A.19.CPM:0 - At a glance (didactic, informative)

CPM is the CHR comparison kernel: it compares two admitted profiles under an explicit, admissibility‑gated comparator and returns a **set‑valued** comparison outcome.

**One-screen purpose (manager-first).** CPM answers: "Given two admitted profiles and an explicit comparator, what relation holds under the declared admissibility frame?" It does **not** answer: "Which one should we pick?" (selection) nor "What is the score?" (scoring).

**Use this when.** Use CPM when the current project question is comparison under one declared comparator, not scoring, folding, selection, publication, or work authorization.

**What this buys.** The practitioner gets a comparison relation that can be audited and later consumed by selection without turning partial order, incomparability, missing evidence, or scale limits into a hidden scalar winner.

**First output.** Write or cite one `ComparisonResultSlot` carrying the relation or poset tokens, comparator ref, admissibility frame, and evidence and currentness pins needed for replay.

**Manager quick checklist (before you trust a comparison):**
* **Comparator is explicit:** do we have a `ComparatorSpecRef`, and is it admitted by `CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet`?
* **Admissibility is declared:** do we cite `CG‑Spec` (and `SCP` when numeric ops exist) and treat violations as `degrade|abstain`?
* **Evidence is not faked:** are missing or unknown inputs treated as `degrade|abstain` under the effective MinimalEvidence policy (never as `pass`)?
* **Partiality is preserved:** are we willing to accept incomparability and ties as first‑class outcomes (set‑valued result), rather than forcing a winner?

* **Suite stage:** `compare` (pipeline order lives in `A.19.CHR:4.5`, not in the `mechanisms[]` enumeration).
* **Input (conceptual):** left profile, right profile, `CN‑Spec`, `CG‑Spec`, an explicit `ComparatorSpec`, context slice; optional explicit `MinimalEvidence` override.
* **Output (conceptual):** `ComparisonResultSlot` as a **set of relation or poset tokens** (not a single scalar, and not an embedded selection decision).
* **Planned slot fillings:** concrete `ComparatorSpecRef.edition` and any policy ids are planned fillers **only** under the `A.15.3` planned slot-filling ontic and are carried by `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows (A.15.3 + `A.19.CHR:4.7.2`). CPM's kernel does **not** fill project-specific slots; executions record the **effective** refs and pins in `Audit`.
* **Reproducible comparisons:** for parity and benchmark style runs that require a stable run package plus report record (editions, windows, parity pins), use `G.9` (Parity and Benchmark Harness). CPM stays kernel-only.
* **What CPM does not do (strict distinction):**

  * does **not** normalize (`UNM`);
  * does **not** choose indicators (`UINDM`);
  * does **not** score (`USCM`);
  * does **not** fold or aggregate (`ULSAM`);
  * does **not** select (“pick best”) — that is `SelectorMechanism`.
* **Core safety commitments:** admissibility gate via `CG-Spec.ComparatorSet` + `CG-Spec.SCP` + CSLC; tri-state admissibility (`pass|degrade|abstain`); unknown never coerces to “pass” or to a fabricated outcome; no silent scalarization or totalization.
* **Where method details live:** in editions of `ComparatorSpec` and their SoTA wiring (Part G packs and extensions), not inside CPM’s kernel semantics.
* **Quick rule of thumb:** if you need **numbers**, that’s `USCM`; if you need a **selection or selected-set result**, that’s `SelectorMechanism`. CPM’s job is only: **compare → relation tokens**.

### A.19.CPM:1 - Problem frame

FPF's Characterization (CHR) suite treats comparison as a **distinct** mechanism stage (`compare`) with suite‑wide obligations that forbid hidden scalarization or totalization, require tri‑state guards, and enforce admissibility declarations for numeric operations. Comparison must therefore be described as:

* a **mechanism** (in the `U.Mechanism.Intension` sense, per `A.6.1` and slot discipline `A.6.5`),
* that is **suite‑conformant** (per CHR obligations and protocol closure in `A.19.CHR`),
* and **governing-spec-ref-respecting** (comparability and admission are governed by `CN-Spec` and admissibility is gated by `CG-Spec` rather than re-invented locally).

Within suite protocols, CPM appears as the explicit `compare` stage: it consumes admitted left and right profiles (scores and folded measures **when** those upstream stages are present) and produces an admissible, auditable **comparison relation** that downstream selection can consume without CPM smuggling selection or scoring semantics into “comparison”.

### A.19.CPM:2 - Problem

Engineering teams frequently need to compare two options (designs, methods, vendors, trajectories, hypotheses, etc.) across multiple measures and under incomplete evidence. Without a canonical comparison mechanism, teams predictably fall into one or more of these failure modes:

* **Hidden scalarization:** forcing a single number (or a single winner) from multi‑criteria reality, erasing incomparability and ties.
* **Silent totalization:** inventing an implied total order by convenience tie‑breakers or implicit thresholds, even when only a partial order is warranted.
* **Inadmissible arithmetic:** comparing across measures using operations that are not scale-admissible (CSLC‑violating) or not admitted by the declared admissibility frame.
* **Comparator drift:** “the comparator” exists only as prose or code intuition; different teams compare the same option set and measure set differently because the comparator spec is not explicit and edition‑pinned.
* **Unknown coercion:** missing or unknown evidence is coerced into an outcome (e.g., “treat missing as equal”, “treat unknown as worse”), producing comparisons that look decisive but are epistemically unsafe.
* **Cross‑context leakage:** comparing across contexts or planes without explicit bridges, CL references, or penalty discipline, producing misleading outcomes that ignore transport costs and reference plane constraints.

CPM exists to make the comparison act explicit, admissibility‑gated, set‑valued, and auditable -- so downstream selection can remain a separate, policy‑bound step.

### A.19.CPM:3 - Forces

1. **Usability vs correctness:** engineers want a "simple compare" function; correctness demands explicit admissibility, explicit comparator choice, and explicit handling of incomparability and unknown evidence.
2. **Total order convenience vs partial order truth:** total orders simplify downstream selection; partial orders are often the faithful representation (especially in multi‑criteria settings).
3. **Evolvability vs stability:** comparator methods evolve (SoTA churn); kernel semantics and slot field sets must remain stable and wiring‑friendly.
4. **Auditability vs speed-of-discussion:** teams want fast decisions; FPF requires audit pins and explicit edition and policy references for reproducibility.
5. **Cross‑context reasoning vs transport discipline:** comparisons across contexts are valuable, but they require bridge‑only crossings and explicit penalty assignment, not implicit “normalization by hand”.
6. **Avoiding “second centers of gravity”:** mechanism semantics must have a governing pattern; otherwise the suite, `A.6.1` archetypes, and Part‑G wiring drift apart.

### A.19.CPM:4 - Solution

CPM is specified as a canonical `U.Mechanism.Intension` whose core commitments are:

* **Comparator admissibility is declared and gated** (`CG-Spec.ComparatorSet`, and `CG-Spec.SCP` when numeric operations are involved; scale admissibility via CSLC).
* **Results are set‑valued relation or poset tokens**; partial orders remain partial; no silent scalarization or totalization.
* **Admissibility is tri‑state and fail‑closed** on missing admissibility and evidence; unknown never coerces into a fabricated outcome.
* **Comparison remains distinct from selection**; CPM produces relation outcomes; `SelectorMechanism` consumes them.

This pattern defines (governing-pattern, wiring‑friendly):
1. a **stable mechanism boundary** for admissible comparison: `Compare(...) → ComparisonResultSlot` plus a tri‑state `CompareEligibility` guard;
2. a **stable SlotKind field set** (by suite lexicon tokens) that downstream selection and Part‑G wiring can rely on without SlotKind drift;
3. an **admissibility and evidence responsibility split**: admissibility is gated by `CG-Spec` (and CSLC), while admission and comparability relations are cited from `CN-Spec`;
4. a minimal **audit-pin requirement**: what pins and editions MUST be recorded to make a comparison replay‑grade;
5. explicit **planned slot-filling separation**: `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows carry planned edition and policy fillers; CPM records effective refs and pins in `Audit`.

#### A.19.CPM:4.1 - Mechanism.Intension (canonical; normative)

This is the canonical `U.Mechanism.Intension` for `CPM.IntensionRef`. It is intended to be cited by CHR suite publications and by any wiring layers.

* **Scope note:** this intension is an **instance** authored to the `U.Mechanism.Intension` shape (`A.6.1`). It does **not** publish telemetry, does **not** publish `GateDecision` or `DecisionLog` records (gate‑only), and does **not** embed selection. It emits `Audit` pins and a tri‑state guard only (per suite obligations).
  * **Planned slot fillings:** this intension does **not** fill project-specific slots for editions, policy ids, bridge ids, or similar pins. Planned fillers live in `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows (A.15.3 + `A.19.CHR:4.7.2`); executions record effective refs and pins in `Audit`.

* **IntensionHeader:** `id = CPM`, `version = 1.0.0`, `status = stable`.

* **IntensionRef:** `CPM.IntensionRef` (canonical target for the suite member named in `A.19.CHR:4.2`).

* **SignatureManifest (optional; importability):** if a CPM publication is intended for reuse beyond the CHR suite, author SHOULD publish a `SignatureManifest` that records (i) the declared `Compare` stage‑op signature, (ii) the SlotKind field set (by lexicon tokens), and (iii) the explicit set‑valued output commitment (no silent scalarization or totalization).

* **Tell.** Lawful comparison producing **set‑valued** parity or poset outcomes (not a single scalar).

* **Purpose:** admissible comparison producing **set‑valued** parity or poset outcomes (not a single scalar).

* **Imports:** `G.0 (CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet, CG‑Spec.SCP, CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence)`, `A.18 (CSLC)`, `A.19.CN (comparability and admission declarations)`, `A.19.CHR:4.2.1 (CHR SlotKind Lexicon)`.

* **SubjectBlock:**

  * **SubjectKind:** `Comparison`.
  * **GovernedValueDomain:** CHR-typed measures in a CG-Frame (see `CG-Spec.ComparatorSet`).
  * **SliceSet:** `U.ContextSliceSet`.
  * **ExtentRule:** comparison ranges over admitted left and right profiles under the active context slice, using a declared comparator from `CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet`.
  * **ResultKind?:** `U.Set` (relation or poset token set; set‑valued by default).

* **SlotIndex** (derived projection from `SlotSpecs` and guard SlotSpecs; uses `A.19.CHR:4.2.1` SlotKind tokens; no independent semantics):

  * `LeftProfileSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (of U.Measure), refMode = ByValue⟩`,
  * `RightProfileSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (of U.Measure), refMode = ByValue⟩`,
  * `CNSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CN‑Spec, refMode = CNSpecRef⟩`,
  * `CGSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CG‑Spec, refMode = CGSpecRef⟩`,
  * `ComparatorSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = ComparatorSpec, refMode = ComparatorSpecRef⟩`,
  * `ContextSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.BoundedContext, refMode = U.BoundedContextRef⟩`,
  * `MinimalEvidenceSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = MinimalEvidence, refMode = MinimalEvidenceRef⟩` (optional override; otherwise cite `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`),
  * `ComparisonResultSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (relation or poset tokens), refMode = ByValue⟩`.

* **OperationAlgebra** (suite stage = `compare`, per `A.19.CHR:4.5`; canonical stage‑op = `Compare`):

  * `Compare(LeftProfileSlot, RightProfileSlot, CNSpecSlot, CGSpecSlot, ComparatorSpecSlot, ContextSlot, MinimalEvidenceSlot?) → ComparisonResultSlot`.

* **LawSet** (minimum; set‑valued comparison, no hidden scalarization):

  1. **ComparatorSet gate:** `ComparatorSpecSlot` MUST be an element of `CGSpecSlot.ComparatorSet` (admissibility gate; cite `G.0`).
  2. **Set‑valued semantics:** `ComparisonResultSlot` is set‑valued (parity or poset tokens); partial orders remain partial — no silent totalization or scalarization.
  3. **CSLC+SCP admissibility:** any numeric ops implied by the comparator MUST be admissible under `CGSpecSlot.SCP` and CSLC-admissible (cite `G.0` + `A.18`).
  4. **Unknown is not coerced:** missing or unknown evidence MUST NOT be mapped to a comparison outcome; use tri‑state guards.
  5. **No hidden thresholds or tie‑breakers:** any thresholds, epsilons, priority orders, or tie‑break logic MUST live in the declared `ComparatorSpecSlot` (or in `CNSpecSlot.acceptance` as explicit acceptance clauses), edition‑pinned and auditable; CPM MUST NOT smuggle constants.
  6. **No implicit UNM:** CPM MUST NOT perform normalization or alignment internally. If `CNSpecSlot.comparability` declares normalization‑based invariants for comparison, `CompareEligibility` MUST treat “inputs are already normalized to the declared invariants” as a precondition for `pass` (otherwise `degrade|abstain` per policy). Any UNM dependence MUST be explicit upstream and auditable.

* **AdmissibilityConditions** (tri‑state guard; fail‑closed on missing admissibility and evidence):

  * `CompareEligibility(LeftProfileSlot, RightProfileSlot, CNSpecSlot, CGSpecSlot, ComparatorSpecSlot, ContextSlot, MinimalEvidenceSlot?) → GuardDecision ∈ {pass|degrade|abstain}`.
  * `pass` requires: (i) `ComparatorSpecSlot ∈ CGSpecSlot.ComparatorSet`, (ii) any comparator‑implied numeric ops are admissible under `CGSpecSlot.SCP` and CSLC-admissible for the effective measure scales, (iii) both profiles are admitted and comparable under `CNSpecSlot.comparability` and `CNSpecSlot.acceptance` for the given `ContextSlot`, and (iv) evidence satisfies the **effective** MinimalEvidence policy (explicit override via `MinimalEvidenceSlot?`, otherwise `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`).
  * If `CNSpecSlot.comparability` is normalization‑based (compare‑on‑invariants), `pass` additionally requires that the inputs are already in the required invariant and normalization regime; CPM MUST NOT “make them comparable” by silent normalization.
  * If `MinimalEvidenceSlot` is absent, the guard MUST evaluate evidence against `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence` (by explicit rule), and MUST NOT return `pass` when evidence is missing or unknown **or** fails the effective MinimalEvidence gate.

* **Applicability:**

  * Intended to be used as the CHR stage `compare`: it may follow indicatorization or scoring and optional folding **when those stages are present**, and it precedes selection wherever selection occurs; MUST remain distinct from selection (no embedded “pick best”).
  * Applicable only when admissibility and evidence declarations are present via `CGSpecSlot` (fail‑closed otherwise).
  * When used inside the CHR suite, stage ordering and optionality are determined only by `A.19.CHR:4.5 (suite_protocols)`; CPM does not infer order from `mechanisms[]`.

* **Transport:** Bridge, CL, and ReferencePlane only; penalties are assigned to **`R_eff` only**.

* **Γ_timePolicy:** `point` by default (no implicit “latest”).

* **PlaneRegime:** values live on **episteme ReferencePlane**; on plane crossings apply **CL^plane** policy; penalties → **`R_eff` only**.

* **Audit:**

  * MUST record: `CNSpecRef.edition`, `CGSpecRef.edition`, and the effective comparator (`ComparatorSpecRef`).
  * When `MinimalEvidenceSlot?` is present, MUST record `MinimalEvidenceRef`; otherwise MUST cite `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence` as the effective evidence policy.
  * SHOULD record: the realized `GuardDecision` for `CompareEligibility`, and (when `degrade`/`abstain`) any referenced failure-behavior or downstream-handling policy ids (e.g., a SoS‑LOG branch id) when such policies are in scope.
  * If `CNSpecSlot.comparability` declares normalization‑based invariants for comparison, Audit MUST record the effective upstream normalization dependency (e.g., the relevant UNM intension, edition, or other explicit normalization witness), or explicitly record that the comparison abstained or degraded because normalization admissibility is missing.
  * SHOULD record: a stable description of `ComparisonResultSlot` and any Bridge, CL, and ReferencePlane ids when `Transport` was used.

#### A.19.CPM:4.2 - Interpretation notes — informative

* **Set‑valued output is the default, not a loophole.** “Set‑valued” means CPM preserves incomparability, ties, and partiality as first‑class outcomes; it does not authorize silent post‑processing into a scalar or a single winner.
* **Total orders are allowed only if declared by the comparator.** If a `ComparatorSpec` defines a total order, CPM still outputs a (singleton) set of relation tokens; the totalization is a property of the declared comparator, not an implicit kernel default.
* **Normalization is not smuggled into comparison.** If `CN‑Spec.comparability` declares normalization‑based invariants for comparison, that dependence must be represented explicitly via the suite protocol and, where needed, explicit Uses contours (CPM consumes admitted profiles; it does not silently normalize them).
* **Thresholds and tie‑breakers are never “kernel constants.”** If thresholds exist, they belong to explicit policies or specs (e.g., `ComparatorSpec`, `AcceptanceClauses`), edition‑pinned and auditable; not to hidden constants inside CPM.

### A.19.CPM:5 - Archetypal Grounding — informative

#### A.19.CPM:5.1 - Tell

Think of CPM as an **auditable relation‑builder**:

* Input: "two admitted profiles + an explicit comparator spec + declared admissibility and evidence declarations"
* Output: “a **set‑valued** relation outcome that preserves incomparability and uncertainty”

The key didactic boundary is: **CPM compares; it does not decide.**

#### A.19.CPM:5.2 - Show (U.System) — comparing two supplier options without faking a total order

A program manager compares Supplier‑A vs Supplier‑B for a safety‑critical component. The team tracks a profile of measures (cost, lead time, defect rate, assurance, sustainability), but not all measures are strictly comparable across regions (different reporting regimes, different units).

* The project has a declared `CN‑Spec` (admission and comparability declarations) and a declared `CG‑Spec` that lists admissible comparators in `ComparatorSet` and evidence rules in `MinimalEvidence`.
* The comparator chosen is explicit: `ComparatorSpecSlot = ParetoDominanceComparatorSpecRef@edition` (declared in `CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet`).
* CPM runs `Compare(...)`.

  * If Supplier‑A is better in cost but worse in defect rate and incomparable on assurance due to missing evidence, CPM does **not** invent “A wins” or “A loses”.
  * The guard returns `degrade` or `abstain` (per evidence policy), and the `ComparisonResultSlot` preserves the partial nature of the relation.
* The downstream `SelectorMechanism` can then return a selected set (e.g., keep both suppliers in the candidate set) rather than forcing a single winner by hidden tie‑break rules.

#### A.19.CPM:5.3 - Show (U.Episteme) — uncertainty‑aware comparison with set‑valued outcomes

A research lead compares two proposed methods for a system component. Both methods have performance estimates with uncertainty bounds (e.g., distributions or prediction intervals). The team uses a SoTA uncertainty quantification package (post‑2015 conformal families are a common example) to avoid overstating confidence.

* `USCM` produces score profiles that are interval‑valued (or otherwise uncertainty‑annotated) rather than point estimates.
* The chosen comparator is uncertainty‑aware and declared as a `ComparatorSpec` (edition‑pinned) in `CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet`.
* CPM compares the two profiles and returns a set of relation tokens (e.g., “not worse”, “incomparable under evidence”, “abstain”), rather than forcing a numeric margin.
* The audit records the effective comparator edition and evidence policy, so later readers can reproduce *why* a comparison abstained or degraded (instead of mistaking “missing evidence” for “equality”).

### A.19.CPM:6 - Bias-Annotation — informative

CPM is a comparison *kernel*; it does not remove bias by itself, but it prevents the most common bias‑amplifying failure modes (hidden thresholds, hidden tie‑breakers, unknown coercion).

Typical bias risks and mitigations:

* **Comparator choice encodes value judgments.** Weights, priority orders, thresholds, and “tie‑break” conventions can encode organizational bias. CPM forces these to live in explicit, edition‑pinned `ComparatorSpec` records or policy records rather than in invisible code or informal reasoning.
* **Missing evidence is rarely random.** If evidence is systematically missing for certain contexts or groups, naive “unknown → worse” is a bias amplifier. CPM’s tri‑state guard avoids coercion; but teams must still define policy‑bound failure behavior and be explicit when abstention is acceptable.
* **Cross‑context comparisons can embed structural unfairness.** CPM enforces bridge‑only transport and penalty assignment (`R_eff` only), making “comparisons across worlds” explicit instead of silently assuming commensurability.
* **Overconfidence via scalarization.** Collapsing partial orders into scalars often overstates certainty and hides tradeoffs. CPM makes set‑valued outcomes first‑class, so the human or managerial decision can remain honest about tradeoffs.

### A.19.CPM:7 - Conformance Checklist

A CPM publication or use is conformant if it satisfies the checks below (these complement `CC‑UM.*` and the CHR suite obligations in `A.19.CHR:4.3`):

| Check Id | Requirement (normative) | Notes (didactic and evidence) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑0** | **Mechanism.Intension completeness.** The publication includes the full intension shape (header, imports, subject, slot index, operation algebra, laws, admissibility, applicability, transport, time, plane, and audit) and uses tri‑state guards. | SlotIndex is **derived**; see `A.6.5` + `CC‑UM.*`. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑1** | **Single governing pattern.** The canonical CPM intension is governed here (`A.19.CPM:4.1`); other descriptions cite this section rather than restating the kernel law. | Prevents near-duplicate comparison semantics from drifting. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑2** | **Suite stage alignment.** `Compare` is the canonical stage‑op for CHR stage `compare`; ordering and optionality are taken only from `A.19.CHR:4.5`. | Never infer order from `mechanisms[]`. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑3** | **SlotKind discipline.** SlotKind tokens follow the suite lexicon (`A.19.CHR:4.2.1`). | No SlotKind drift across specializations and wiring. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑4** | **Comparator admissibility gate.** `ComparatorSpecSlot ∈ CGSpecSlot.ComparatorSet` is enforced (fail-closed otherwise). | Admissibility is declared, not improvised. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑5** | **Scale admissibility.** Any numeric operations implied by the comparator are admissible under `CGSpecSlot.SCP` and CSLC-admissible. | “Weighted sum” etc must be explicitly admissible. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑6** | **Set‑valued semantics.** Outputs remain set‑valued; no silent scalarization or totalization is introduced. | Incomparability and ties are first‑class outcomes. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑7** | **Tri‑state admissibility (fail‑closed).** `CompareEligibility(...) → {pass|degrade|abstain}` exists and does not return `pass` on missing admissibility and evidence. | Unknown never coerces to `pass`. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑8** | **MinimalEvidence defaulting is explicit.** If `MinimalEvidenceSlot?` is absent, the effective evidence policy is `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence` by explicit rule. | Avoid “implicit evidence policy.” |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑9** | **Gate and guard separation + lexeme discipline.** CPM does not publish `GateDecision` nor `DecisionLog`; mechanism predicates use `…Eligibility` (not reserved gate `…Guard`). | Aligns with suite obligations (`gate_decision_separation`, `guard_lexeme_reservations`). |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑10** | **Transport and plane discipline.** Crossings are Bridge, CL, and ReferencePlane only; penalties are assigned to `R_eff` only; plane crossings use `CL^plane` when needed. | Keep cross‑world comparisons explicit. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑11** | **Audit completeness.** Audit records `CNSpecRef.edition`, `CGSpecRef.edition`, effective `ComparatorSpecRef@edition`, and the effective evidence policy (override or cited default). | SHOULD record GuardDecision + crossing ids. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑12** | **Planned slot-filling separation.** Editions and policy ids are planned fillers only in `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows; CPM records effective refs and pins in Audit and does not fill those slots. | Planned baseline = A.15.3 + suite PlanItem. |
| **CC‑A19CPM‑13** | **No implicit UNM.** CPM never performs silent normalization; normalization‑based comparability requires explicit upstream UNM witness (or `abstain` or `degrade`). | Keeps “compare‑on‑invariants” explicit. |

### A.19.CPM:8 - Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* **Anti‑pattern: “Comparison returns a score.”**
  *Symptom:* `Compare(x,y)` returns a numeric margin or a single rank position.
  *Avoid:* keep numeric scoring in `USCM`; CPM returns relation tokens (set‑valued). If a numeric comparator is desired, it must be an explicit `ComparatorSpec` and still yields relation tokens as the kernel output.

* **Anti‑pattern: “CPM picks the winner.”**
  *Symptom:* comparison logic embeds winner selection or selected-set truncation.
  *Avoid:* CPM only compares; selection is `SelectorMechanism`, which consumes comparison outcomes and remains policy‑bound.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Comparator by prose or code default.”**
  *Symptom:* comparator choice is implicit (e.g., “we usually do lexicographic by safety then cost”), not edition‑pinned.
  *Avoid:* require an explicit `ComparatorSpecRef` from `CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet` and record it in Audit.

* **Anti‑pattern: “GateDecision leakage.”**
  *Symptom:* the `compare` step emits or assumes GateDecision, GateLog, or DecisionLog records as part of suite closure, or uses reserved gate‑lexemes (`…Guard`) for mechanism‑level predicates.
  *Avoid:* keep CPM at guard+audit level (`…Eligibility → GuardDecision ∈ {pass|degrade|abstain}`); assign gate decisions to their proper governing patterns or gate records and keep publication and telemetry outside suite closure.

* **Anti‑pattern: “SlotKind drift.”**
  *Symptom:* renaming or re‑purposing `LeftProfileSlot`, `RightProfileSlot`, `ComparatorSpecSlot`, or `ComparisonResultSlot` across specializations or across CHR layers.
  *Avoid:* use the suite SlotKind lexicon (`A.19.CHR:4.2.1`) and keep SlotIndex as a derived projection.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Smuggling plan‑binding into CPM.”**
  *Symptom:* hard‑coding comparator editions, policy ids, or “launch values” inside the CPM intension or pattern prose.
  *Avoid:* put edition and policy fillers only in `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows; keep CPM refs-only and record effective refs and pins in `Audit`.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Tie‑breakers as hidden constants.”**
  *Symptom:* forced total order via untracked thresholds, epsilons, or “if equal then compare cost” logic.
  *Avoid:* make tie‑break policy part of explicit comparator and acceptance policies; pin editions; audit.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Unknown coerces to outcome.”**
  *Symptom:* missing evidence treated as equal, zero, or worse, producing decisive comparisons from absent information.
  *Avoid:* tri‑state guard; fail‑closed on missing evidence; explicit failure behavior via evidence policy.

* **Anti‑pattern: “Cross‑context compare without transport.”**
  *Symptom:* comparing profiles across contexts or planes without Bridge, CL, and ReferencePlane discipline.
  *Avoid:* use transport mechanisms and crossing pins; assign penalties to `R_eff` only; audit crossing ids.

### A.19.CPM:9 - Consequences

* **Improved usability (didactic):** CPM gives a single, engineer‑readable place to learn “what admissible comparison means” and what it does *not* mean.
* **Higher auditability:** comparison outcomes can be traced to comparator edition, admissibility declarations, and evidence policies.
* **Reduced semantic drift:** teams cannot silently shift from Pareto to lexicographic to “weighted sum” without changing explicit comparator specs and pins.
* **Explicit tradeoffs:** set‑valued outcomes force downstream reasoning to acknowledge incomparability and uncertainty rather than hiding them.
* **Cost:** downstream consumers (notably selection) must handle sets, abstentions, and partial orders explicitly. This is intentional: it moves complexity from hidden heuristics into explicit policy‑bound mechanisms.

### A.19.CPM:10 - Rationale

1. **Set‑valued by design:** partial orders are common in multi‑criteria settings; pretending they are total creates false certainty and brittle decisions.
2. **ComparatorSet gating:** declaring which comparisons are admissible, and under what scale or evidence rules, prevents “algorithm by convenience”.
3. **Tri‑state guards:** explicit `pass|degrade|abstain` preserves epistemic honesty: unknown is not silently converted into an outcome.
4. **Strict distinction:** separating compare from score and select prevents hidden semantic coupling and improves evolvability (methods change via wiring; kernel stays stable).
5. **Single governing pattern:** keeping one governing pattern eliminates near-duplicate comparison descriptions that drift apart and destroy usability.

### A.19.CPM:11 - SoTA-Echoing

**SoTA vs popular note.** This section records alignment to post‑2015 evidence‑backed practice. It is **not** a mandate to use fashionable methods; method semantics stay in SoTA packs (`G.2`) and wiring modules, while this pattern fixes the stable CPM mechanism boundary.

Concrete comparator-family SoTA packages are cited through their current Part G pack or claim sheet when one governs the use. CPM's kernel semantics remain unchanged.

| **Fair ranking and constrained ranking** (e.g., Zehlike et al., 2017; Biega et al., 2018)                                             | Reinforces the “no hidden tie‑breaks and thresholds” stance: fairness constraints belong in explicit comparator and acceptance policies, not as silent kernel constants. | Integrate via `ComparatorSpec` editions in `CG‑Spec.ComparatorSet` + policy pins; CPM remains unchanged.              |
| **Uncertainty-aware and set-valued inference** (e.g., Romano et al., 2019; Barber et al., 2021)                                       | Supports “comparison may abstain” and “set‑valued outcomes are honest”: uncertain profiles should not be coerced into point‑comparisons.                         | Model as comparator families (or supporting method families) packaged in `G.2`; wired into declared `ComparatorSpec`. |
| **Differentiable sorting and learned comparators** (e.g., Grover et al., 2019; Blondel et al., 2020)                                  | When comparators are learned, explicit comparator specs and edition pins become even more critical for auditability and drift control.                           | Treated as method implementations behind `ComparatorSpec` (wiring‑only in Part G); CPM kernel stays stable.           |
| **Robust multi‑criteria decision support under partial orders** (modern robust outranking and preference-learning variants post‑2015) | Emphasizes preserving incomparability and explicitly encoding thresholds and preferences as declared artifacts.                                                      | Packaged as comparator families; admissibility and evidence remain gated by `CG‑Spec`.                                     |

### A.19.CPM:12 - Relations

**Builds on and cites (non‑exhaustive):**

* `A.6.1` (shape of `U.Mechanism.Intension`; specialization discipline)
* `A.6.5` (slot discipline; SlotIndex as derived projection)
* `A.19.CHR` (suite membership + obligations + `suite_protocols`; CHR SlotKind lexicon)
* `A.15.3` + `A.19.CHR:4.7.2` (planned slot-filling ontic and `SlotFillingsPlanItem` rows; CPM remains refs-only with respect to planned slot filling)
* `A.19.CN` (CN-Spec comparability plus acceptance and admission declarations)
* `G.0` (CG‑Spec: `ComparatorSet`, `SCP`, `MinimalEvidence`, CL and ReferencePlane framing)
* `A.18` (CSLC scale admissibility)
* `E.10` (lexical and ontological authoring rules; kind suffix discipline)
* `E.19` (checks; authoring discipline)
* `E.20` (governing-pattern discipline)
* `F.18` (alias docking; ID continuity)
* `E.18` (project transformation-flow structures consume CPM instances; CPM does not create a parallel “card deck”)

**Relates to (typical named patterns in the CHR Uses contour):**

* `UNM.IntensionRef`, `UINDM.IntensionRef`, `USCM.IntensionRef`, `ULSAM.IntensionRef`, and `SelectorMechanism.IntensionRef` (downstream consumer of CPM results).
* `G.5` (selection conformance), `G.9` (parity and benchmark harness), `G.10` and PTM (publication and telemetry outside suite closure).
