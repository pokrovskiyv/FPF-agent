## A.7 - Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)
> **Status:** Stable

### A.7:0 - Use this when

Use this pattern when one sentence, diagram, card, identifier, file, plan, or run is being read as several nearby FPF objects and the team needs to recover the exact relation position before checking the recovered claim under its exact subject predicate. A frequent case is deciding whether the live object is a Method, an episteme that qualifies as MethodDescription, a system Capability, a WorkPlan, or dated Work.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A label such as *algorithm*, *SOP*, *recipe*, or *script* is treated as membership evidence; a direct Method reference is forced through a document; or a description, plan, capability and occurrence inherit one another's force.

**What this buys.** A practitioner can identify the current object, make the smallest direct claim, and stop without manufacturing a description, execution, evidence, gate, or authority relation.

**Primary working object.** The exact sentence or publication position whose nearby objects have been conflated. A.7 restores the distinctions; A.3.1 is the pattern for the Method, C.2.1 is the pattern for episteme identity, A.3.2 is the pattern for same-individual `U.MethodDescription` membership, A.15 is the pattern for plan and Work, and naming/reference patterns contain the defining content for designation and resolution.

**First useful move.** Name the object the receiving use actually needs. For a suspected MethodDescription, first identify one admitted `U.Episteme`, then require one admitted `U.Method` as its exact `EntityOfConcern` and at least one substantive claim about that Method as a way of doing. For a direct Method use, resolve the identifier or receiving `methodRef` under its effective reference scheme; do not invent a MethodDescription.

**Not this pattern when.** If the current object and direct relation are already clear, use the applicable pattern immediately. A.7 supplies no decision about Method identity, episteme identity, MethodDescription membership, capability adequacy, work readiness, occurrence, evidence, publication, or gate passage; handle each such claim under its applicable pattern.

### A.7:1 - Intent

Provide a **single, didactically clear lattice of distinctions** that keeps models free from category errors. This pattern is the guard‑rail that prevents four recurrent confusions:

1. **System-role kind vs function** (classification vs behaviour),
2. **MethodDescription vs Method vs Capability vs Work** (description vs abstract way-of-doing vs system ability/envelope vs performed occurrence),
3. **Holon vs System vs Episteme** (what can act and what cannot),
4. **EntityOfConcern vs Description episteme, View, and Publication** (the item under concern vs epistemes and publication relation positions that make it available; specification is a gated use or refinement of a Description episteme, not a third peer member of this distinction).

It harmonizes A.2 and A.2.1 for system-role kinds and system-role-assignment relations, A.3.4 for transformation, A.10 for evidence-provenance and carrier and source-currentness relations, A.14 for advanced mereology, A.15 for System-Role-Method-Work alignment, C.2.1 for episteme constitution and its separate empirical-grounding and edition relations, E.17 for publication and view discipline, and F.9, F.17, and F.18 for bridge and naming discipline.

### A.7:2 - Problem frame

* **Holons (A.1) and systems.** All holons are part-whole units; **systems or acting holons** enact behaviour. When assignment matters, name the assignment occurrence and the declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species whose predicate it satisfies.
* **Transformation (A.3.4) and system-role assignment (A.2 and A.2.1).** Every claimed change names the transformation or Work occurrence, the affected entity, and any assignment of the acting System or holon, including the occurrence and its declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species; there is no “self-magic”.
* **Method and Work backbone (A.3.1, A.3.2, A.15).** We separate **MethodDescription** (the same already identified episteme only after A.3.2 membership obtains), **Method** (abstract way-of-doing), **Capability** (a System's ability or envelope to enact a Method under conditions), **WorkPlan** (intent window), and **Work** (run-time occurrence). An assignment names both its occurrence and declared species without making either the actor.
* **Evidence (A.10).** Knowledge claims cite evidence-provenance and carrier/source-currentness relations; epistemes never “act”; systems inspect, revise, publish, store, or rely on the carriers, publication forms, and project records that make an episteme available.

Practitioner check: if a sentence could be read as “the document decided” or “the process executed itself”, it violates A.7.

Boundary for use from other patterns: A.7 restores the `EntityOfConcern`, the admissible describing relation, and the publication boundary; then use the defining or testing rule for the remaining claim, with its PatternID kept only as a locator. Do not let A.7 turn an architecture, structure, work, method, evidence, characterization, or decision question into a general discussion of descriptions. If the `EntityOfConcern` is itself a Description episteme or view, keep the pattern centered on that episteme as the item under concern; description-of-description or publication-force issues open only when they are the exact claim being made.

### A.7:3 - Problem

When documents blur the above lines, three classes of defects appear:

1. **Category collapse.** People write “function”, “role”, or “process” interchangeably; teams then disagree whether they are changing a MethodDescription, a Method, a Capability envelope, or reporting an actual Work occurrence.
2. **Agency misplacement.** Epistemes (documents, models) are treated as doers; collectives as raw sets; or a “holon” is used where **only a system** makes sense.
3. **Audit failures.** A MethodDescription is cited as if it were evidence; Work has no evidence carriers or time span; or a Description episteme, a Description episteme admitted for specification use, a View, publication face, publication unit, or carrier is treated as if it were the `EntityOfConcern`, decision, permission, gate, work occurrence, or assurance result.

### A.7:4 - Forces

| Force                                        | Tension                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Didactic brevity vs conceptual precision** | Teams want short words (“process”, “function”) ↔ the framework must keep five distinct distinctions apart.                          |
| **Universality vs domain idioms**            | We admit engineering idioms (procedure, SOP, algorithm, workflow) ↔ internally we must map them unambiguously.                    |
| **Parsimony vs completeness**                | Minimal concept set ↔ enough distinctions to avoid the classic traps: system-role kind versus function; description, Method, Capability, and Work; and episteme versus carrier. |

### A.7:5 - Solution — The **Clarity Lattice** (normative distinctions & safe vocabulary)

#### A.7:5.1 - **Terminology (normative): orthogonal characteristics**
• **senseFamily** — the categorical characteristic, used by F.7/F.8/F.9: {Role | Status | Measurement | Type‑structure | Method | Execution}. Rows must be **sense‑uniform**.
• **ReferencePlane** — the referent mode per CHR: {world/external | conceptual | epistemic}.
• **EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary** — the item under concern is separated from Description epistemes (E.10.D2, C.2.1). Specification use is a gated use or refinement of a Description episteme; the exact gate must name checkability, formality plus checkable constraint, harness, acceptance condition, C.16 measurement criterion, verification use, or another specification-granting neighbouring pattern. Specification is not a third member of the strict distinction.
• **DesignRunTag** — the design vs run DesignRunTag. It is not a temporal “plane”, generic layer, or stance.
• **Publication face, form, unit, carrier, and rendering boundary** — Description epistemes, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use, may be made available through publication units, publication forms, faces, renderings, and carriers. These publication values are not the `EntityOfConcern` value, not the Description episteme itself, not the specification-use gate or refinement, and not evidence, gate passage, work, assurance, or decision force by readable form. The ordinary didactic faces for architectural patterns in FPF are:
  {**PlainView** (explanatory prose), **TechCard** (typed cards and IDs), **NormsCard** (TechCard profile for checklists), **AssuranceLane** (evidence bindings)}. Publication faces and forms are orthogonal to the `EntityOfConcern` and Description-episteme boundary, to specification-use gates and refinements, and to DesignRunTag.
• **Typed describing morphism and specification-use boundary** — `Describe_EoC_DescEp : EntityOfConcern -> DescriptionEpisteme` describes an `EntityOfConcern` value into a Description episteme under a declared construction/reference trace; it is **not** a mechanism and does not execute work. A later refinement, formalisation, or specification-use claim over that Description episteme is governed by the neighboring pattern governing the claim whose force is live: A.6.2 for effect-free episteme refinement, C.2.3 for formality and checkability, A.21 or the relevant gate/acceptance pattern for harness and acceptance force, C.16 for measurement criteria, E.17 for publication expression, and E.10 for suffix discipline. A.7 keeps those boundaries visible but does not turn them into a second strict-distinction member.
  **Laws (normative for A.7):** (DESC-1) *Non-extensibility of content* and (DESC-2) *identity and meaning-preserving composition*. Specification-use/refinement laws are enforced by the neighboring pattern governing the claim that selects the gate and value set.

• **EntityOfConcern / episteme / publication boundary** — `EntityOfConcern` wording names the item under concern under the declared construction/reference trace; it does not name a document, publication face, carrier, or unspecified referent. `Describe_EoC_DescEp` yields a Description-side `U.Episteme` about that `EntityOfConcern` value. A Description episteme may later be used as a specification only when a bounded use declares formality plus checkable constraint, harness, acceptance condition, C.16 measurement criterion, verification use, or another specification-granting gate. Publication faces, cards, views, publication relation positions, records, and carriers remain orthogonal relation positions: they can make Description epistemes available, but they do not become the EntityOfConcern value, the Description episteme, specification-use gate/refinement, evidence, gate passage, work, assurance, or decision force by appearing in a publication form.

A.7 establishes the following **pairs and triplets**. Use their **names** and **scope** exactly as below.

#### A.7:5.2 - System-role kind vs function-like wording, functional behaviour, capability, method, and work

* **System-role kind.** One local `U.Kind`, identified by a named practice or source boundary together with a stable assignable work-facing contribution, classifies systems by that contribution. An obtaining assignment occurrence may relate a system to that kind only through a directly admitted `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species. The kind is **not behaviour**. Example: `CoolingCirculatorSystemRole@ThermalLoop-7`.
* **Function-like wording.** A source phrase such as "function", "behaviour", "service", or "does X" may name a required transformation or effect (A.3.4), functional behaviour (A.6.F), a capability envelope, a method, performed work, a quality, or a structure. Recover the governed claim before choosing the FPF term.
* **Under a system-role assignment.** A System or acting holon that holds an assignment may have a **Capability** to enact a **Method** under conditions and may perform **Work** that produces, maintains, prevents, or checks a transformation or effect. Name both the assignment occurrence and its declared species when that distinction matters. The system-role kind is not the behaviour, Method is not identical to the transformation or effect, and Capability is not the Method.

Safe rewrite for earlier "Holonic Duality (Substance vs Function)": **Holonic Duality (Substance vs system-role kind).** A `U.System` keeps its identity while its classifications and obtaining assignments change. A contribution named by a system-role kind may call for a Method, a Capability envelope to enact that Method under conditions, and possible Work occurrences; none follows from the kind alone.

**Normative guard:** Use **system-role kind** for that exact local `U.Kind`, an admitted direct species under `U.SystemRoleAssignment` for assignment occurrences, **functional behaviour** for a behaviour claim stated with A.6.F, **Method** for the abstract way-of-doing, **Capability** for a system ability or envelope to enact a Method under conditions, **Work** for the performed occurrence, and **Transformation** or effect wording for an actual change identified with A.3.4. Do not call the kind or assignment itself a function, and do not define Method as Capability or as the transformation or effect itself.

#### A.7:5.3 - MethodDescription vs Method vs Capability vs Work (description vs way-of-doing vs ability envelope vs occurrence)

* **MethodDescription** — one already identified claim-bearing `U.Episteme` whose exact C.2.1 `EntityOfConcern` is one admitted `U.Method` and whose claims, under its effective `U.ReferenceScheme`, say something substantive about that Method as a way of doing. A transformation or enactment concern, generic participant meanings, applicability, precondition, intended effect or preserved condition, bound, or internal method composition can satisfy the positive threshold. The labels *algorithm*, *SOP*, *recipe*, *script*, *procedure*, code, diagram, or design-time artifact are cues only. Authoring, revision, citation, publication, approval, or use time establishes neither episteme identity nor `U.MethodDescription` membership. Its publication cites A.10 carrier/source-currentness refs when the carrier is used as evidence or source.
* **Method** — the **abstract order-sensitive way-of-doing** composed with **Γ\_method** (B.1.5). A Method is not an occurrence, description episteme, or system ability. Actual participants and operation values remain occurrence-side facts of separately admitted `U.Work` and its direct bindings.
* **Capability** — the **system ability or envelope** to enact a Method under stated system-role assignments, operating conditions, resources, and constraints. Attribute it to the exact system and state the conditions that bound the claim; it is not the MethodDescription and not the performed Work.
* **Work** — the **dated run-time occurrence** (what actually happened), with resource spend (Γ\_work) and temporal coverage (Γ\_time).

**Designation, reference, and description are different.** A Method identifier designates one exact `U.Method` under the applicable designation rules of an effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. A receiving claim's `methodRef` separately resolves under its effective scheme to that same Method. Neither operation needs a MethodDescription. Cite a separate `methodDescriptionRef` only when that receiving claim actually depends on claims in an exact episteme edition that has already passed A.3.2 membership.

**Minimally viable reference and membership case.** Under `MaintenanceReferenceScheme-2026`, identifier `PumpSealInspectionMethod` designates exact admitted Method `M-PSI`. `MaintenancePlan-47` is a separately governed `U.WorkPlan`; its `methodRef = PumpSealInspectionMethod` resolves directly to `M-PSI`, without a description hop. Episteme `PumpSealInspectionGuide-e3` is independently identified by C.2.1 from its exact claim content, `EntityOfConcern = M-PSI`, and effective scheme. Its claims state the inspection precondition, ordered clean–inspect–classify way of doing, rejection bound, and stop; the same episteme therefore passes A.3.2 membership as `U.MethodDescription`. If `MaintenancePlan-47` relies on those exact e3 claims, a separate `methodDescriptionRef = PumpSealInspectionGuide-e3` may be cited. The plan, Method, MethodDescription, Capability and any later Work remain different objects.

**Recognizable near misses.** A catalogue row containing only `PumpSealInspectionMethod` designates or mentions a Method but is not a MethodDescription. A file named `PumpSealInspectionSOP-v3.pdf` supplies neither the C.2.1 episteme identity nor the substantive method claim by filename. `methodRef = PumpSealInspectionMethod` does not imply that a description exists. A newly authored, revised, cited, approved, published, or used episteme does not gain membership unless its exact Method EntityOfConcern and substantive way-of-doing claim satisfy the same test.

**Normative guard:** Never use MethodDescription as evidence of Work; never present Method or Capability as if it had happened; never define Method as Capability; never infer MethodDescription membership from form, label, lifecycle time, or use. Resolve direct Method designation and receiving references without mandatory description indirection.

#### A.7:5.4 - Holon vs System vs Episteme (who can act)

* **System or acting holon** — the entity that can enact behaviour when it is the holder in one obtaining occurrence of an exact work-facing `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species.
* **Episteme** — **cannot act** and is not the holder in a work-facing system-role assignment; it is changed via carriers, publications, and work on those carriers by systems or acting holons. Reference, constraint-source, evidence, status, source, requirement, publication, and assurance uses are direct relations or uses, not system-role assignments.
* **Holon** — umbrella term; do not use it where the current claim requires a system as assignment holder. Write the exact holder and one named occurrence of the locally admitted direct assignment species—for example, `ValveSelectionAssignment-47 : ValveSelectionTransformerAssignment`, with `HolderSystemSlot = DesignTeamSelectionSystem` and `AssignedSystemRoleKindSlot = TransformerSystemRole@ValveSelectionContext`. In this source designation, `ValveSelectionContext` must resolve to the named practice or source boundary used to identify the local kind; the assertion may cite that boundary, but it is not an assignment participant.

**Normative guard:** Work-facing system-role kinds, including `TransformerSystemRole@ValveSelectionContext`, are local `U.Kind` values identified by their named practice or source boundary and stable contribution distinction. A declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species defines the holder and assigned-kind participant meanings, predicate, applicability, and occurrence identity. An occurrence supplies the holder System or acting holon, assigned local kind, any other participants, and extent. Epistemes do not acquire a system-role kind or assignment merely because they are used as references, evidence, constraints, sources, requirements, publications, or assurance inputs.

#### A.7:5.5 - Episteme vs publication carrier and source-currentness record

* **Episteme** — the knowledge content (claim, model, requirement set).
* **Publication carrier or source-currentness record** — the physical or digital carrier for an episteme publication or stored representation (file, volume, dataset item), tracked through A.10 carrier/source-currentness relations when evidence, source, or reliance use is current.
* **Use:** Evidence, provenance, and reproducibility address **carriers**; arguments and validity address **epistemes**.

**Normative guard:** When you say “we updated the spec”, detail **which carriers** changed (A.10).

#### A.7:5.6 - Collective vs Set, and MemberOf vs Component/Constituent/Portion/Phase (A.14)

* **Set / Collection (MemberOf)** — **mathematical or catalog** grouping; **no joint behaviour** implied.
* **Collective System** — a **system** with boundary and coordination Method (e.g., a team).
* **Use relations correctly:**

  * **ComponentOf** — mechanical/structural part in systems.
  * **ConstituentOf** — logical/content part in epistemes.
  * **PortionOf** — quantitative portion with conserved extensives.
  * **PhaseOf** — temporal part/state across a continuous identity.
  * **System-role assignment** — a **system or acting holon** is the `HolderSystemSlot` value in one obtaining occurrence of a directly admitted `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species.

**Normative guard:** If the grouping is expected to **act**, model a **collective system** (not a set) and provide its exact system-role kind and assignment when current, Method, and Work.

#### A.7:5.7 - Operator alignment (required names)

* **Γ\_sys** — composition of **system** properties (physical/systemic).
* **Γ\_method** — composition of **Method** (order, branching).
* **Γ\_time** — composition of **Work** histories and temporal parts.
* **Γ\_work** — composition of **resource spend** and yields tied to Work. Do not track costs with Γ\_method; costs (resources/yield) belong to Γ\_work.

**Normative guard:** Avoid generic “process” for these operators. Reserve “process” for domain idioms; map internally to **Method** (design) and **Work** (run).

#### A.7:5.8 - EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary vs publication face, form, unit, and carrier boundary (orthogonal, normative)
* **EntityOfConcern-to-description boundary.** A.7 keeps the EntityOfConcern and an episteme that describes it distinct; E.10.D2 supplies the Description and specification-use repair. What the `EntityOfConcern` value is and how it is described are different questions. A Description is a `U.Episteme` about that exact entity under its effective scheme. A named describing use may separately select one viewpoint when the selection changes what is read or checked. Specification is a checkable use or refinement of the Description episteme and requires checkable claims plus a named harness or validation relation; formality, acceptance, a C.16 measurement criterion, or verification practice may contribute to that test but does not substitute for it. EntityOfConcern, Description, selected viewpoint, and specification use remain distinct.
* **Publication governs availability.** Publication units, publication forms, faces, renderings, and carriers make Description epistemes available to readers or tools, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use. They do not become the `EntityOfConcern` value, the Description episteme, the specification-use gate/refinement, or an evidence/source carrier by the same relation; physical and digital carriers stay in A.10 carrier/source-currentness relations when evidence, source, or reliance use is current.
* **Publication-face field pins.** When Description epistemes or Description epistemes admitted for specification use are shown on **TechCard**, the minimal **CHR-Pins** are {**UnitType**, **ScaleKind**, **ReferencePlane**, **EditionId**}.
* **Bridge policy.** Cross-context or cross-reference-plane reuse cites **Bridge id + CL**; **Phi(CL)** and **Phi_plane** penalties apply to **R (trust)** only; **F and G invariant**.

#### A.7:5.8a - Same or near-same EntityOfConcern across descriptions and views

Different descriptions, views, viewpoints, publication units, or role-method-interest positions may concern the same `EntityOfConcern`, different entities of concern, or an unresolved candidate set. A.7 does not accept sameness by publication title, view label, carrier continuity, shared ordinary name, or common reader interest.

Use this split when the text needs to say whether two descriptions or views are about the same thing:

| Case | A.7 relation case | Admissible move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| same referent by value | the localized `EntityOfConcern` or relation named by value, carried by the current claim, or selected by a reference case and the resolved `entityOfConcernRef`, where live, refer to the same item by declared reference discipline | same-entity work inside the declared use |
| preserved by viewing | A.6.3 viewing preserves the exact EntityOfConcern while producing another episteme whose claim content or effective ReferenceScheme may differ; any representation relation and any viewpoint selected for a named describing use remain separate | same-EntityOfConcern Description, Specification, or view transformation |
| publication-unit primary only | a bounded publication unit states what it is mainly about, plus its carried move and outside-work boundary, without establishing a claim-bearing episteme trace by itself | publication-unit stability only |
| bridge-conditional near identity | An F.9 Bridge obtains, and a separate affirmative bounded-use claim names the proposed use, direction, correspondence rule, tolerated loss, and polarity. A practitioner may first use F.18 to settle the governed value's designations and, only when a durable term row is needed, then use F.17 to constitute that row; neither step establishes the Bridge or licenses reuse, while publication, evidence, and any reliance judgement remain separate. | bridge-scoped reuse only |
| retargeted under invariant | A.6.4 changes `entityOfConcernRef` under `KindBridge`, invariant, and loss discipline | retargeted use only under stated invariant |
| unresolved candidate | construction/reference/bridge/witness trace is insufficient | candidate tracking, question framing, or non-use |
| different entity | no admissible sameness or near-sameness path exists for the intended use | keep entities distinct |

If the same or near-same relation needs mathematical or postulate-theory justification, A.7 stops at the strict-distinction boundary instead of pretending to prove it: use C.29 for the mathematical lens, E.18 and E.18.1 where transformation-flow, carry-through, and postulate-theory work supply the required justification, E.18 where a gate crossing is the live relation, or the relevant architecture pattern where the comparison is about structure, graph, flow, or architecture description.

#### A.7:5.8b - Compact relation-position recovery aid

When one visible source-side carrier, publication face, diagram, dashboard, card, model output, `PublicationUnit`, rendering, or generated artifact can be read as several FPF values at once, use A.7 only to recover the current relation position. Name the current `EntityOfConcern`, Description episteme, view, publication face, publication form, `PublicationUnit`, carrier, rendering, mathematical-lens use, evidence relation, gate decision, work occurrence, authority-reference relation, source-currentness relation, or source-use claim, then apply the subject pattern for that position.

This aid is not a reusable object, local record, table, or master checklist. If the direct governed claim is already clear, do not add an A.7 recovery note; cite the direct pattern.

#### A.7:5.9 - Typed describing morphism and specification-use boundary (normative)

**What `Describe_EoC_DescEp` means in A.7.** For any `EntityOfConcern` value `X`, *describing X* is the morphism application `Describe_EoC_DescEp(X) : DescriptionEpisteme`. A.7 does not define a second strict-distinction arrow from Description to Specification. When a Description episteme is formalised, constrained, test-harnessed, accepted, or used as a specification, that is an episteme-refinement or specification-use question handled by A.6.2, C.2.3, A.21, C.16, E.17, E.10, or another neighboring pattern governing the claim according to the live force.

**Example.** A formal postulate theorem in physics can be a Description episteme about the behaviour of a physical grounding holon. Its formal language belongs to formality and publication-expression discipline. It becomes a specification only if a bounded use assigns specification force, such as acceptance criteria, harness checks, normative invariants, or verification use. Formal notation alone does not make it a third kind beside the physical `EntityOfConcern` and the Description episteme.

**Invariants (normative for A.7, split by EntityOfConcern kind):**
1. **Episteme-source preservation (DESC-1E).** When the `EntityOfConcern` value `X` is itself a `U.Episteme`, a claim graph, a claim-bearing view, or another claim-bearing source, `Describe_EoC_DescEp(X)` MUST NOT silently add epistemic commitments. Added structure is only declared representation, indexing, cross-reference, or refinement/loss under the neighboring pattern governing the claim that grants it.
2. **Non-episteme describing trace (DESC-1N).** When `X` is a system, structure, Work occurrence, system-role assignment, Method, physical object, characteristic, relation, or other non-episteme value, claims are not "inside X" waiting to be copied. A Description episteme may add claims about `X` only through a declared construction, reference, measurement, observation, model, postulate-theory, or witness trace, with admissibility conditions visible for the intended use.
3. **Identity and meaning preservation (DESC-2).** If `f : X -> Y` is a meaning-preserving, bridge-admitted, or construction-preserving map for the selected EntityOfConcern values, then `Describe_EoC_DescEp(f)` is defined only for the declared scope and preserves the exact identity, near-identity, bridge, loss, or retargeting relation established by its predicate and current facts. Where meaningful composition exists, `Describe_EoC_DescEp(f o g) = Describe_EoC_DescEp(f) o Describe_EoC_DescEp(g)` only under that declared relation.
4. **Specification-use refinement case.** If a Description episteme is refined into specification use, the refinement must name the neighboring pattern governing the claim and gate that grants that use. A.7 only requires that the refinement remains separate from the `EntityOfConcern`, from publication expression, and from Work.
5. **Separation from Gamma.** `Describe_EoC_DescEp` and any neighbouring specification-use refinement do **not** compose with **Gamma_method**, **Gamma_time**, or **Gamma_work**; describing, formalising, or specifying is not execution and accrues no resource or time semantics.
6. **Ontology preservation.** Describing any `EntityOfConcern` value, such as a Calculus, Signature, Mechanism, Structure, Work occurrence, or Episteme, via `Describe_EoC_DescEp` does **not** change its ontology; it yields a Description episteme under A.7 rules. Publication through faces, forms, units, and carriers is handled separately in E.17 (MVPK).

#### A.7:5.10 - Bridge to `U.Work` (normative invariants)

**OUTSPEC‑INV‑1 (No metonymy).**
`promisedOutcomeSpecRef` points to an **OutcomeSpec**, not to `U.Work` and not to an extensional delivered-result referent. The *actuals* live on `U.Work` (A.15.1) and its evidence carriers.

**OUTSPEC‑INV‑2 (Evaluability from work evidence).**
All predicates referenced by `workPredicateRef`, `postConditionRef`, and `unitOfDelivery.countingRule.*` MUST be evaluable from `U.Work` facts and cited evidence (including `U.Work.Δ` state records or evidence carriers). They MUST NOT require introspecting the internal structure of the provider system unless that structure is itself exposed as evidence.

**OUTSPEC‑INV‑3 (Counting coherence).**
If `unitOfDelivery` is present, its countingRule MUST select only work episodes that are eligible to satisfy the promise content and MUST not silently double‑count (use `dedupeKeyRef` or a cited policy).

##### A.7:5.10.1 - Canonical examples (didactic)

**Example 1 — Work‑only (promise the work): “provide consultation for ≥5 minutes”.**

```text
OutcomeSpec(OS‑Consult‑5min) := {
  mode: WorkOnly,
  workSpec: {
    methodConstraintRef?: ConsultationMethod,
    workPredicateRef: E‑(duration(work) ≥ 5 minutes)
  }
}

unitOfDelivery := {
  unitLabel: "minute",
  countingRule: {
    selectorRef: E‑(work fulfils OS‑Consult‑5min),
    quantityRef: E‑durationMinutes(work),
    aggregation: sum
  }
}
```

**Example 2 — Result‑only (promise the world state): “a hole of depth ≥ 1 m exists”.**

```text
OutcomeSpec(OS‑Hole‑1m) := {
  mode: ResultOnly,
  resultSpec: {
    deliveredResultReferentRef: kind(Hole),
    statePlaneRef: GeometryPlane,
    postConditionRef: E‑(depth(hole) ≥ 1 m ∧ location(hole) within SiteScope)
  }
}

unitOfDelivery := {
  unitLabel: "hole",
  countingRule: {
    selectorRef: E‑(work fulfils OS‑Hole‑1m),
    quantityRef: E‑1,
    aggregation: count,
    dedupeKeyRef: E‑holeId(work)         // prevents double counting when rework happens
  }
}
```

**Example 3 — Composite (promise both): “hairstyle for the evening, produced within 20 minutes, by cut+style (not a wig)”.**

```text
OutcomeSpec(OS‑Hair‑Evening‑20min) := {
  mode: Composite,
  workSpec: {
    methodConstraintRef: CutAndStyleNoWigMethod,
    workPredicateRef: E‑(duration(work) ≤ 20 minutes)

In these cards, each `methodConstraintRef` resolves directly to an admitted `U.Method`. Add a separate `methodDescriptionRef` only when the OutcomeSpec claim actually depends on claims in one exact A.3.2-admitted description edition; neither the constraint nor its reference creates that membership.

(Where `E‑(…)` is shorthand in these cards for a separately identified episteme or predicate under the card's named effective ReferenceScheme and ClaimScope; this appendix does not introduce an expression language.)

### A.7:6 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell-Show-Show; System and Episteme)

#### A.7:6.1 - System and Episteme example
**System archetype — “Digital‑twin vs asset”.**
*Claim:* *The twin (episteme) does not act; the System or acting holon that holds the assignment performs Work on the asset. Name the assignment occurrence and its declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species; evidence binds through A.10 carrier and source-currentness relations and evidence-provenance relations.*
*Show:* Claim-bearing episteme `MaintenanceGuide-e4` is a **MethodDescription** only because C.2.1 identifies it with exact maintenance Method `MaintenanceMethod-M1` as EntityOfConcern and its claims state substantive preconditions, actions, bounds and stops; its TechCard form and design-time authoring do not grant membership. A **Work** record (assurance face) lists Γ_time, Γ_work, PathId and **carrier** ids for telemetry. The twin’s update is **Work on the carrier**, not the asset; CL^plane penalties are disclosed when twin–asset crossings are analysed.

**Episteme archetype — “Peer‑review vs manuscript”.**
*Claim:* *A review is Work by a **system** (the reviewer) **on carriers** of an episteme (the manuscript).*
*Show:* Review episteme `PeerReviewGuide-e2` qualifies as **MethodDescription** only because its exact EntityOfConcern is admitted Method `PeerReviewMethod` and its claims state how that review is done; the SOP label alone proves nothing. The **Work** cites carrier ids (file/edition) and the selected episteme; arguments/rebuttals live on epistemes; acceptance gating lives in CAL, not in CHR cards.

#### A.7:6.2 - Didactic examples

**Example 1 — Pump in a cooling loop**

* **Substance (system):** Centrifugal pump P‑12.
* **System-role kind and assignment:** `CoolingCirculatorSystemRole@ThermalLoop-7`; `CoolingLoopCirculationAssignment-17 : CoolingLoopOperationAssignment` has pump P-12 as `HolderSystemSlot` and that kind as `AssignedSystemRoleKindSlot`.
* **MethodDescription membership:** episteme “Loop Circulation v3” has the circulation Method below as exact EntityOfConcern and claims the start → ramp → hold → stop way, conditions and bounds; its **TechCard** representation and publication timing do not establish membership. Cite A.10 carrier/source-currentness refs when evidence or source use is current.
* **Method:** ordered way-of-doing: start → ramp → hold → stop (Γ\_method).
* **Capability:** P-12 control-unit ability or envelope to enact that Method under the stated assignment, conditions, resources, and constraints.
* **Work:** run on 2025‑08‑09 10:00–10:45; energy ledger via Γ\_work; log via Γ\_time.
* **Safe phrasing:** *“Pump P-12, the holder in `CoolingLoopCirculationAssignment-17` to `CoolingCirculatorSystemRole@ThermalLoop-7`, had the **Capability** to enact the **Method** described by **MethodDescription**, and performed **Work** …”*
* **What not to write:** “The pump's function is its system role” (system-role kind and behaviour are different).

**Example 2 — Standard document cited in a design**

* **Episteme:** “Safety Standard S‑174”.
* **Carriers:** PDF and printed volume with A.10 carrier/source-currentness refs when the standard is used as source or evidence.
* **Use relation:** reference-use or constraint-source-use relation for the valve selection activity, named by its subject pattern.
* **System-role assignment for Work:** `ValveSelectionTransformerAssignment` is the declared species; it defines the holder and assigned-kind participant meanings, local kind domain, predicate, applicability, and occurrence identity. Occurrence `ValveSelectionAssignment-47` has `DesignTeamSelectionSystem` as holder and `TransformerSystemRole@ValveSelectionContext` as assigned-kind value. `ValveSelectionContext` resolves to the named ValveSelection practice boundary in that local kind's identity basis; the assertion may cite that boundary, but it is not an assignment participant.
* **MethodDescription membership:** episteme “Valve Selection SOP v5” has the valve-selection Method below as exact EntityOfConcern and claims the selection criteria, ordered checks, bounds and stop; the SOP label and citation alone establish neither episteme identity nor membership.
* **Method:** abstract valve-selection way-of-doing described by that SOP.
* **Capability:** design team's selection-service ability/envelope to enact the Method under the project conditions.
* **Work:** dated selection session that **used** the standard; the episteme did **not** act.

**Example 3 — Set vs team**

* **Set (MemberOf):** {Alice, Bob, 3.14} — a collection; **no behaviour** implied.
* **Collective system (team):** boundary, coordination **Method**, supervision **Work**; can be the holder in an obtaining occurrence such as `CoolingMaintenanceAssignment-8 : CoolingMaintenanceWorkAssignment`, whose declaration-local kind slot admits `CoolingMaintenanceSystemRole@ContextT`. Here `ContextT` denotes the named team-maintenance practice boundary used to identify that local kind; it is not an assignment participant.
* **Safe phrasing:** *“`CoolingMaintenanceAssignment-8 : CoolingMaintenanceWorkAssignment` obtains with `HolderSystemSlot = TeamT` and `AssignedSystemRoleKindSlot = CoolingMaintenanceSystemRole@ContextT`; TeamT performed Work W under that assignment.”*

### A.7:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID                                       | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Practical test                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A7.1 (System-role-kind and behaviour split)** | A local **system-role kind** is a `U.Kind` identified by a named practice or source boundary and stable work-facing contribution distinction; an assignment is one occurrence of a directly admitted `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species. Behaviour is expressed as **Method**, with **Capability** as the exact system's ability or envelope to enact that Method under stated conditions and **Work** as the run-time occurrence. | If wording makes the kind or assignment do something, rewrite it so the holder system performs the Work by enacting a Method through a Capability. |
| **CC‑A7.2 (Transformer-system-role assignment domain)** | A suffixed source designation such as `TransformerSystemRole@ValveSelectionContext` is usable only after the suffix resolves to the named practice or source boundary in the kind's identity basis and a direct `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species admits that exact local kind in its declaration-local kind slot and systems in its holder slot. | Type-check the exact species, holder, kind domain, predicate, applicability, and occurrence identity; do not filter a permissive family value by a role label. |
| **CC‑A7.3 (Episteme non‑agency)**        | An **episteme SHALL NOT** be described as acting or as the holder in a work-facing system-role assignment. Changes to epistemes are stated through publication, carrier, Work, evidence-provenance, and source-currentness relations: Work on carriers, publication updates, evidence-provenance relations, and source-currentness records under A.10/E.17/A.15. | Text contains the acting system or holon, Work occurrence, and carrier, publication, or evidence relation when change or evidence is claimed. |
| **CC‑A7.4 (MethodDescription ≠ Method ≠ Capability ≠ Work)** | **MethodDescription** is the same independently identified C.2.1 episteme only when its exact EntityOfConcern is one admitted Method and at least one substantive way-of-doing claim obtains; **Method**, **Capability**, and **Work** retain their separate meanings. Form, label, design-time status, authoring, revision, citation, publication, approval, or use time grants no membership. | Identify the episteme triple and apply the A.3.2 threshold; then name each current Method, Capability claim and dated Work occurrence separately. |
| **CC‑A7.5 (Operator fit)**               | Use **Γ\_method** only for composing **Method**; **Γ\_time** only for **Work** histories; **Γ\_work** only for resource spend/yields; **Γ\_sys** for systemic properties of systems.                                                                                                           | No sentence should use a single generic “process operator” for all three.                                                                 |
| **CC-A7.6 (Carrier/source-currentness reference)** | Any knowledge claim that references documents or data **SHALL** cite publication carriers or A.10 carrier/source-currentness refs when evidence, source, or reliance use is current. | First mention names the carrier or source-currentness reference and the evidence/source relation made recoverable by that reference. |
| **CC‑A7.7 (Collective vs set)**          | If a grouping is expected to **act**, it **MUST** be modelled as a **collective system** (boundary + coordination Method + Work), not as a **MemberOf** set.                                                                                                                                   | Presence of boundary, Method, Work for the group.                                                                                         |
| **CC‑A7.8 (Diagram legend)**             | When domain idioms use **“process”**, diagrams or text **MUST** map them to FPF terms on first occurrence: *process (domain) ≡ Method at design time or Work at run time.*                                                                                                                           | Legend or parenthetical present at first use.                                                                                             |
| **CC‑A7.9 (System identity ⧧ system-role-kind wording)** | The safe formula is: **one System or acting holon holds an assignment; name its occurrence and declared species. Under that assignment the System has the stated Capability for a Method; its execution is Work.** | Sentences follow this order; “function” is used only as a cue to recover the behaviour claim, never as a name for the system-role kind. |
| **CC-A7.10 (Work-facing chain clarity)** | Any “triad” picture **MAY** be used only as a design-time view, never as MethodDescription-membership or execution evidence. It may show the exact assignment holder and Method directly; it may add MethodDescription only after the independently identified episteme passes A.3.2 membership; and it **MUST** show explicit Capability and Work positions elsewhere in the same section. “quartet of quartets” headings **SHALL** be avoided; use **“work-facing chain”** instead. | Diagram has visible Method, Capability and Work positions and timeline; any MethodDescription box states its episteme, exact Method EntityOfConcern and substantive claim basis. |
| **CC‑A7.11 (Terminology hygiene)**       | Avoid **“actor”** as a bare core term. Use the exact acting system or holon plus one named occurrence of its locally admitted direct assignment species when a work-facing assignment is current. | Plain text scan: no bare “actor” in normative core claims; any local shorthand is bound through A.2 and A.2.1. |
| **CC‑A7.12 (System-role domain guards)** | Work-facing assignment species declare `HolderSystemSlot` for systems or acting holons and a local system-role-kind domain for `AssignedSystemRoleKindSlot`. Epistemes may be used through reference-use, constraint-source-use, evidence-use, status-use, source-use, publication-use, requirement-use, definition-use, explanation-use, assurance-use, or gate-use relations, but those uses create neither a system-role kind nor an assignment. | Each assignment names its occurrence and declared species. The species defines participant meanings, predicate, applicability, and occurrence identity; the occurrence supplies holder, assigned kind, case applicability, and extent. Episteme uses name the relation. |
| **CC-A7.13 (EntityOfConcern-to-Description visibility)**          | Conforming `EntityOfConcern` and Description-episteme use makes `Describe_EoC_DescEp` recoverable and does not conflate it with MVPK, transformation-flow structure, specification use or refinement, or Work steps. If a flow shows only publication faces and forms, the underlying `EntityOfConcern` and Description episteme are recoverable.       | EntityOfConcern and Description episteme are visible in text and diagrams; audit shows the describing operation and its construction/reference trace.                                                             |
| **CC-A7.14 (Describe_EoC_DescEp laws)** | Any implementation of `Describe_EoC_DescEp` MUST enforce the split DESC-1E/DESC-1N/DESC-2 law family. Episteme EoCs preserve or refine source claims under declared loss; non-episteme EoCs receive claims only through declared construction/reference/measurement/model/witness traces. Specification-use refinement is checked by the neighboring pattern governing the claim that grants the gate, not by A.7 as a third strict-distinction member. | Audit shows whether the EoC is episteme-like or non-episteme, which trace introduces claims, and which relation preserves identity, near-identity, bridge, loss, or retargeting. |
| **CC-A7.15 (Specification-use boundary)**         | If text claims that a Description episteme is a specification, formal specification, requirement, acceptance item, harnessed invariant, or measurement-criterion object, it names the exact gate: C.2.3 formality plus checkable constraint, A.21/gate or acceptance discipline, C.16 measurement-criterion discipline, A.6.2 episteme refinement, E.17 publication expression of an already admitted specification use/refinement, E.10 suffix discipline, or another neighboring pattern governing the claim. Formal notation alone is insufficient.                                     | The text shows the specification-granting gate and does not make specification a peer ontology class beside EntityOfConcern and Description.                                                     |
| **CC-A7.16 (Γ-separation)**              | describing morphisms (`Describe_EoC_DescEp`), specification-use refinements, and publication-face or publication-form projections (MVPK) carry no cost/time semantics; **Γ\_method**, Γ\_time and Γ\_work belong to **Method, Work, or System**, not to description, specification-use refinement, or publication. Any aggregate on a card cites the Γ operator and policy.   | No ledger/time fields attached to `Describe_EoC_DescEp`, specification-use refinement, or MVPK publication steps; any “publication cost” is Work in a separate publication service.             |
| **CC‑A7.17 (Publication face and form discipline)**     | Publication names use the current publication face, form, unit, carrier, and rendering vocabulary. `PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, and `AssuranceLane` are faces over epistemes or views; new `...PublicationFace` or `...PublicationForm` heads are not introduced as A.7 kinds in this ontology.                                                 | Token scan shows no ad‑hoc `...PublicationFace` or `...PublicationForm` kinds.                                                       |
| **CC‑A7.18 (Bridge+CL on crossings)**    | Any cross‑Context or cross‑plane content on a face **MUST** cite **Bridge id + CL** and **Φ policy‑ids**; penalties apply to **R** only.                                                                         | Presence of Bridge ids and **Φ(CL)** and **Φ_plane** on TechCard or AssuranceLane.                        |
| **CC-A7.19 (UTS row reference)**         | Public names shown on faces **SHALL** point to **UTS rows** with twin labels (Tech/Plain), edition pins, and carrier/source-currentness refs when source or evidence use is current. | Face carries UTS row ids + edition pins plus the current source/evidence refs where needed. |
| **CC-A7.20 (Direct Method reference)** | An identifier's designation of one exact Method under an effective ReferenceScheme and a receiving claim's resolved `methodRef` remain separate from `U.MethodDescription` membership. Neither requires a description hop; `methodDescriptionRef` is optional and edition-specific only when the receiving claim uses that episteme's claims. | Resolve the identifier and receiving reference directly to the Method, then apply A.3.2 independently only for an actually cited description episteme. |

### A.7:8 - Canonical rewrites (didactic library)

| Instead of (ambiguous)                           | Write (canonical)                                                                                                                               | Why                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| “The process enforced the rule.”                 | “The admitted system holding `RuleEnforcementAssignment-12 : RuleEnforcementWorkAssignment` performed the **Work** by enacting the **Method**; the Work cites evidence carriers ⟨ids⟩.” | Processes do not act; one exact local assignment occurrence identifies the system and assigned system-role kind without a universal constructor. Evidence uses Work plus A.10 carrier and source-currentness relations. |
| “The specification decided to tighten limits.”   | “The design-control system under an obtaining exact system-role assignment updated the **carriers** of the specification, producing **Work** at ⟨time⟩ and recording the A.10/E.17 carrier and publication relations.” | Epistemes are changed via carriers by systems or acting holons. |
| “Our role is pump; the role circulates coolant.” | “`CoolingLoopCirculationAssignment-17 : CoolingLoopOperationAssignment` obtains with the pump as holder and `CoolingCirculatorSystemRole@ThermalLoop-7` as assigned kind; the pump has the **Capability** for coolant circulation and performed Work ⟨when⟩ under that assignment.” | The system-role kind and assignment do not behave; the holder system performs Work. |
| “We followed the blueprint, so it’s done.” | “Resolve the exact **Method** directly. Call the blueprint's claim-bearing episteme **MethodDescription** only if its exact EntityOfConcern is that Method and it makes a substantive way-of-doing claim; if ability is claimed, name **Capability** separately; completion needs dated **Work** and evidence.” | Form or use does not establish membership, and description, Method and Capability are not the occurrence. |
| “Team = set of members; it performed repair.”    | “The **team** is a **collective system** (boundary + coordination **Method**); it executed **Work** ⟨…⟩.”                                       | Acting groups must be systems, not sets.                  |
| “Process cost is tracked by Γ\_method.”          | “**Work** cost is tracked by **Γ\_work**; **Γ\_method** composes the **Method** (order/branching).”                                             | Operator alignment.                                       |
| “Holon has TransformerRole.”                 | “`ValveSelectionAssignment-47 : ValveSelectionTransformerAssignment` obtains with the admitted system as holder and `TransformerSystemRole@ValveSelectionContext` as assigned kind.” | The holder, exact local kind, and direct assignment species must be explicit; the named practice boundary and any interpreting scheme remain outside the assignment participants. |
| “Publication is a special mechanism.”            | “Publication = availability of existing Description epistemes, including Description epistemes admitted for specification use, through publication units, forms, and faces (MVPK); **describing** is `Describe_EoC_DescEp`, specification use or refinement is governed by the neighboring pattern governing the claiming gate, and any execution around them is separate **Work** by a **system** on **carriers**.” | Publication is not behaviour; it is a Description-episteme-to-publication availability relation in the model. |

### A.7:9 - Anti‑patterns (with fixes)

1. **System-role-kind-as-behaviour** — calling the **system-role kind** a function or saying it acts.
   **Fix:** Name the system-role kind, exact assignment occurrence when current, holder system, Method, Capability, and Work without making the kind or assignment act.

2. **Episteme‑as‑system** — “the model routed traffic”.
   **Fix:** Name the **System or acting holon**, its assignment occurrence and declared species when relevant, the Work that used the model, and the carriers touched.

3. **Triad everywhere** — omitting **Work** entirely.
   **Fix:** Add the Work position: timestamps, outcomes, Γ_time coverage.

4. **Operator blur** — using one “process operator” for everything.
   **Fix:** Choose among **Γ\_method**, **Γ\_time**, **Γ\_work**, **Γ\_sys**.

5. **Set‑as‑collective** — a MemberOf set “decides”.
   **Fix:** Model a **collective system** with coordination Method.

6. **Evidence without carrier references** — citing ideas without carriers.
   **Fix:** Add A.10 carrier/source-currentness refs and tie claims to evidence or source relations.

7. **Holon/system drift** — “holon maintains temperature”.
   **Fix:** Say **system**; reserve “holon” for neutral mereology.

8. **Function and system-role-kind swap in tables** — columns labelled “Function” whose entries are local system-role kinds.
   **Fix:** Rename the column to **System-role kind**; add a separate **Behaviour (Method and Work)** column.

9. **Process‑word leakage** — domain “process” used as FPF operator.
   **Fix:** Add parenthetical mapping at first use (Method and Work).

10. **Carrier and episteme swap** — “we versioned the model” meaning a file was renamed.
   **Fix:** State whether the **episteme content** changed; if only a carrier was renamed, say so.

11. **Publication-as-mechanism** — modelling “publication” as if it were a Method or Mechanism.
   **Fix:** Separate **describing** (`Describe_EoC_DescEp`), specification-use refinement, and **publication** (MVPK Description-episteme-to-publication face, form, unit, carrier, and rendering availability). If there is operational toil (build, render, upload), model it as **Work** by a **system** on **carriers**; do not change the `EntityOfConcern` value, the Description episteme, specification-use gate/refinement, or the publication relation being presented.

12. **Form-first MethodDescription** — “this is an SOP/algorithm/script, therefore it is a MethodDescription.”
   **Fix:** Identify the C.2.1 episteme, resolve one admitted Method as its exact EntityOfConcern, and find at least one substantive way-of-doing claim; otherwise retain only the source cue.

13. **Mandatory description hop** — a Method identifier or receiving `methodRef` is forced through a document or description edition.
   **Fix:** Resolve designation and the receiving reference directly to the exact Method under their effective ReferenceScheme discipline; cite `methodDescriptionRef` separately only when its claims are actually used.

14. **Lifecycle time as membership** — authoring, revision, citation, approval, publication, or use is treated as creating MethodDescription membership.
   **Fix:** Keep those Work and neighboring relations under their subject patterns; reapply the same A.3.2 membership test to the independently identified episteme.

### A.7:10 - Consequences

| Benefit                      | Why it matters                                    | Trade‑off / Mitigation                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Category safety at scale** | Prevents silent logic bugs across holarchies.     | Slight verbosity → use local shorthand only after the holder, exact assignment species and occurrence, assigned system-role kind, and subject pattern remain recoverable. |
| **Trustworthy evidence**     | Work plus A.10 carrier/source-currentness references make claims auditable. | Requires discipline → provide checklists.          |
| **Operator determinism**     | Correct Γ‑flavour selection preserves invariants. | A bit more modelling → reusable templates.         |
| **On‑ramp for managers**     | Canonical rewrites give immediate phrasing fixes. | Team training → this pattern is the training page. |

#### A.7:10.1 - EntityOfConcern and publication-boundary consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Category-error firewall.** Clear separation of System and Episteme, `EntityOfConcern` and Description-episteme boundary, specification use or refinement, and publication availability removes recurring modeling defects. | Authors must name publication face, form, unit, carrier, and rendering uses explicitly; mitigated by E.8 publication-face guidance. |
| **Audit and pedagogy align.** A.10 carrier/source-currentness refs point to carriers; Normative face houses checklists; Plain face teaches; Tech face types. | Slight increase in pattern length; offset by predictable navigation and machine-checkable CC. |
| **Cross-Context safety.** Bridge+CL discipline is visible on publication faces and forms when they carry cross-context material. | Authors must cite CL policy-ids; tooling can assist (GateCrossing visibility harness), but text remains notation-independent. |

### A.7:11 - SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

* **Digital Twins (ISO 23247, 2021→):** separates the asset (system) from its **digital representation** (episteme) and prescribes governance of twins without attributing *agency* to the twin itself — matching A.7’s “episteme ≠ actor” and carrier discipline. **Adopt.**
* **Observability (OpenTelemetry, 2019-2025):** codifies **semantic conventions** as publication-form discipline over traces, metrics, and logs; semantics are governed by descriptions, not exporters, echoing A.7 publication-face and publication-form orthogonality. **Adapt** (terminology).
* **Active Inference (2017→2024):** separates a **generative model** (episteme) from **actions** by the agent (system), with explicit perception–action cycles — mirroring A.7’s “who can act” and stance separation. **Adopt**
* **Constructor Theory (2016→):** frames knowledge and work as **possible transformations** enacted by constructors (systems), not by informational states — reinforcing “episteme ≠ actor”. **Adopt**
* **Quality‑Diversity (MAP‑Elites family, 2015-2024):** archives are **sets on typed spaces** (descriptions) whose **occurrences** are runs; selection returns **sets** under admissible orders, consonant with A.7 and A.15’s set-returning discipline. **Adopt and adapt**.
* **Refinement-typed specs (2016->):** modern refinement-typed specification toolchains (e.g., Liquid Haskell, Dafny's post-2017 refinements, Rust's `uom` type-level units) treat formalization as **monotonic refinement with pinned units and scales**. A.7 uses them only to motivate the specification-use boundary; the refinement laws belong to the neighboring pattern governing the claiming specification, formality, measurement-criterion, and publication patterns. **Adapt** (terminology; pinning discipline).

### A.7:12 - Rationale (informal)

* **Engineering cognition:** Large programmes fail less from equations than from category slips (“process vs procedure vs execution”). A.7 eliminates these slips by a small, repeatable grammar.
* **Compatible with ISO/BORO practice:** Distinguishing reusable ways of doing, claim-bearing description epistemes, system capabilities, and dated operations mirrors established systems-engineering discipline while keeping FPF’s holonic rigor; procedure-like labels remain cues rather than kind evidence.
* **Didactic primacy:** Practitioners can approve sentences by spotting the work-facing distinctions in context: acting System or holon, assignment occurrence and declared `U.SystemRoleAssignment` species, assigned system-role kind, **Method**, **Capability**, **WorkPlan**, **Work**, optional independently admitted **MethodDescription** when its claims are used, and A.10 evidence-provenance, carrier, or source-currentness relation where evidence is claimed.
* **Why name publication faces and forms in A.7?** Strict Distinction already guards the `EntityOfConcern` value from the Description episteme that makes claims about it. In practice, misreadings happen at the publication face: cards and tables are mistaken for EntityOfConcern values; governance words leak where physics or logic should stand. Naming publication face, form, unit, carrier, and rendering uses as orthogonal closes that gap without entangling semantics with any tool or notation. Specification use or refinement is also named only to keep it orthogonal to `EntityOfConcern`, Description, and publication expression. This preserves **C-1 universality** and **P-1 Cognitive Elegance**, while giving E.8 a crisp governing source for multi-face presentation rules.

### A.7:13 - Relations

 **Builds on:** A.1 (Holon), A.2 and A.2.1 (system-role kinds and system-role-assignment relations), A.3.1/A.3.2/A.3.4 (Method, MethodDescription, Transformation), A.10 (evidence-provenance, carrier, and source-currentness relations), A.14 (Advanced Mereology), A.15/A.15.1/A.15.2 (System-Role–Method–Work, Work, and WorkPlan Alignment).
* **Constrains:** A.13 (Agency sits on systems only; epistemes non‑behavioural), Part B operators (**Γ_method**/**Γ_time**/**Γ_work**/**Γ_sys**) and their choice points; **publication is not a Γ‑operator**.
* **Extends:** E.8 (Authoring conventions), E.10 (lexical and precision restoration), **Part F and Part G (UTS and CG-Spec or CHR pinning)**, B.3 (assurance-use discipline), C-cluster (selection and archives) by enforcing `EntityOfConcern` and Description-episteme boundary, specification-use boundary, publication availability orthogonality, System and Episteme separation, same or near-same EoC discipline across views, and typed EntityOfConcern-to-Description describing discipline (**publication = Description-episteme-to-publication face, form, unit, carrier, and rendering availability in E.17**).
* **Coordinates with:** **E.18 (gate crossing and OperationalGate(profile))** for crossing visibility and publication gating, **A.21** for gate checks, **F.9, F.17, E.17, and E.18** for Bridge+UTS pinning discipline, **E.10** for lexical SD checks, and **Part F (Bridges and CL)** for explicit cross-Context identity, without embedding any notation dependence.

### A.7:14 - Practitioner one-page review (copy-paste)

**Approval sentence template**

> “`⟨assignment-occurrence⟩ : ⟨locally admitted direct U.SystemRoleAssignment species⟩` obtains with `HolderSystemSlot = ⟨system-or-acting-holon⟩` and `AssignedSystemRoleKindSlot = ⟨exact local ...SystemRole kind⟩`; the holder has **Capability** ⟨C⟩ to enact exact **Method** ⟨M⟩; the receiving `methodRef` resolves directly to ⟨M⟩ under its effective reference scheme; when this claim actually relies on separately admitted **MethodDescription** episteme ⟨S⟩, cite that edition separately; the holder performed **Work** ⟨W⟩ at ⟨time⟩ under the assignment and cites A.10 evidence-provenance, carrier, or source-currentness refs ⟨ids⟩; resources are accounted through the governing work-cost relation.”

**Six binary checks**

1. **Bare acting-subject check:** No bare “actor” token in normative core claims; the exact acting system and one named occurrence of its locally admitted direct assignment species are present when a work-facing assignment is current.
2. **Clear work-facing positions:** Exact Method, Capability and Work are named when current and not conflated. A MethodDescription is named only when its independently identified episteme and claims pass A.3.2 membership.
3. **Direct reference and membership:** An identifier's designation of the Method and the receiving claim's resolved `methodRef` remain distinct; neither requires a MethodDescription. Any `methodDescriptionRef` points to a separate episteme whose exact EntityOfConcern is that Method and whose claims cross the substantive way-of-doing threshold.
4. **Right Γ:** Γ\_method composes Method; Capability states a system ability/envelope under conditions; Γ\_time covers occurrences; Γ\_work accounts resources; Γ\_sys covers system properties.
5. **Episteme handled:** Epistemes do not act; carriers or source-currentness refs are listed when evidence or source use is current.
6. **Group clarity:** Acting group is a **collective system**, not a MemberOf set.

**Diagram legend stub**

* “process (domain)” ⇒ Method (design-time) / Work (run-time).
* System-role-kind column lists exact local `...SystemRole` kinds and separate assignment references (for example, `CoolingCirculatorSystemRole@ThermalLoop-7` and `CoolingLoopCirculationAssignment-17`).
* Behaviour column shows Method and Work, not the system-role kind or assignment itself.
